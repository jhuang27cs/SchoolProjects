if mercury poisoning didn't exist, i would eat every meal here. snacks too. i have ordered delivery a couple times and was always pleased. however, last night we decided to walk the extremely taxing 1/4mile to dine in and am tickled pink that we did.  fin's takeout menu is limited...they have a whole other menu of GLORIOUS special rolls i didn't even know existed. i imagine the reason be the presentation and STACKS of yummy ingredients wouldn't be able to withstand delivery obstacles. 

the spicy seafood miso soup is delectable...it is everything it owns up to be...spicy miso soup, floating strips of seaweed and tofu accompanied by 2 fresh jumbo shrimps, 2 sea scallops and 2 giant calamari rings. yummmmmmmmm. i want it always.

we ordered  tuna nigiri and smoked salmon nigiri, the double match roll (sweet potato and mango wrapped in avocado and salmon and topped with a slice of strawberry HEAVEN. i don't know how they fit all those ingredients into one roll... but i LIKE it!!) and the mexican roll (spicy tuna with crunchies and topped with tabasco--obviously). i loved every bite.

i will still order take out but i shall frequent the restaurant more often, because i have to sample the other special sushi treats they have to offer. service was marvelous also!
