It's convenient to my work, so I go there for an "Indiano" or Mocha when I need a caffeine fix. The "Indiano" is their term for a Chai Tea Latte. I don't particularly recommend Strada for this, but their Mochas are ok. I had a pretty good chocolate brioche there too, but nothing beats the ones at Muffins, Muffins, and More in Alameda. I just got back from living on the Italian border, so I guess I have to admit that I am a bit snotty about the coffee in America. This place does the job and everyone's right--it's fun to people watch and is in a great location to meet up with friends.
