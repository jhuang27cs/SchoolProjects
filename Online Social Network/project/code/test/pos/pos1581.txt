So as an update to this review, the manager was very kind to write back to me and apologize that I never got a tasting. Although I did end up going with another cake caterer, here is an update on how to get a tasting set up at Sweet Cupcakes:

"As for wedding tastings, we offer in-store tastings where we will set aside up to 6 cupcakes for bride's to taste with our compliments. They can feel free to speak to a manager-on-duty regarding any questions on decor and flavors. We offer display tiers to be rented for the occasion. The tiers hold upwards of 150 cupcakes and are displayed to look like a tiered wedding cake. We can also provide a 6" cake that will fit on the top of the tier and can be used for the traditional cake-cutting."
