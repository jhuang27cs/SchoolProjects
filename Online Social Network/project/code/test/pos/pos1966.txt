I've only ever ordered two items from this place: the spicy BBQ chicken and the soft tofu soup. 

The spicy BBQ chicken is absolutely delicious!!! The flavor is yum yum yum! However, the rice varies, often times it's too dry. 

The soft tofu soup on the other hand....was very very bland. It was pretty much just a bowl of slightly salty water with bits of tofu and other ingredients floating around. 

I give it 4 stars solely for their spicy BBQ chicken dish. I can't really comment on the other food items. The owners are nice, though.
