Even though I'm obsessed with all things food, there is no way I thought I could ever justify driving all the way down to Palo Alto for one food item. My sensibility just doesn't allow for it. 

Until I tasted Fred's steak from Schaub's. 

My in-laws have been eating it for years and I was introduced to it at a holiday get together a few years ago. I was hooked from the first bite. 

It's not a pretty piece of meat by any means. Its outside is black as tar, which I guess is part of the marinade that makes it so darn tasty. 

The only time I find myself at the rather uppity, suburban Stanford Shopping Center is my biannual trek to buy a piece of Fred's Steak. 

It just proves that a good piece of meat outweighs my inner sensibility.
