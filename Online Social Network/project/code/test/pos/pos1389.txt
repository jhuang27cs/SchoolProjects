I came to this simple sandwich shop one day in order to escape the "village" of shops located around the corner. I had a chicken sandwich and a coffee milkshake. 2nd visit I had another chicken sandwich and my friend had a cheesesteak, and both were pretty amazing. They even offer "mini" portions which is great for people who don't always feel like eating (or paying) for the average absurd American portion. I would eat here every day if I could.
