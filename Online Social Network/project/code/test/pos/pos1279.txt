I love this place. I could come here everyday. I am NOT a vegetarian, however I do like to eat like one. Everything here is tasty, delicious (All Veggie) and at good pricing! Although the restaurant itself is not the most spectacular nor does it give you that suuuuper "clean clean" feeling bc it's rather old, the food is all worth it. It's quick, healthy and delicioussss!
