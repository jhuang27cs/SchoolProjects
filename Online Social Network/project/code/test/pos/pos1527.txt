Best sushi I've found in all of the triangle and beyond.
They do an excellent job with the rice, and their presentation is amazing.  This place is for sushi purists and there aren't alot choices that are deep fried and covered in sauce for american tastes.  Good quality ingredients, prepared well are all you need.
There's a limited drink menu, and i'd like to see more varieties of sake.  Overall one of my families top places to eat in Chapel Hill/Carrboro!
