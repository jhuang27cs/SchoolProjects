I'm totally a fan of this place.  I came here because I was in town for a visit and went to check out a Kia Soul because my friend just got his car from there.  Let me tell you, BEST experience with David Hwang!  He's such a nice guy.  Knows what he's talking about and doesn't haggle you.  He got me such a great price on the car, I had to tell all my friends about him.  Plus prices are better down here then up north anyway.
