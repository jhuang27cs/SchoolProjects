I loooove Indian food, and Shiva was the first Indian restaurant I ever went to, way back in the day before they were in the village, so they'll always have a soft spot in my heart. I always go for the lunch buffet, the goat curry is delicious, saag paneer is the creamy good bomb, the naan bread, hot flaky in some spots, soft and fluffy in othere, straight from the oven, raita is tangy and has a good amount of shredded carrot and or some other veggies....I'm making myself hungry!

When I do go there for dinner, I always get the vegetarian sampler.  It comes with about 7 different little dishes, beans, lentils, cauliflower, saag paneer, etc, all seasoned differently along with the naan and raita.

And I always get the spiced iced tea, it just rounds out the whole flavor.  It's the one place I use sweetener in my tea, I don't know why, but it's so dang good!
