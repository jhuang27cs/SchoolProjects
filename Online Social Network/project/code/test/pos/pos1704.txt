mhmm, i love sprinkles, but not so many at once! strawberry is my favorite, simply because i LOOOVE strawberries, and its actually pretty tasty! the cake part even has a strawberry taste along with the rich frosting. my second favorite is the very popular, red velvet. it does it's ravings justice especially with the cream cheese frosting. 

i've also tried the peppermint vanilla! its quite yummy with a sweet vanilla taste and peppermint pieces on the frosting! i think this is only available during the holiday season though. i've also tried the something midnight which is chocolate and vanilla. i think this one is alright though, i don't remember how it tastes like "/

overall, these cupcakes are quite delicious! DO NOT REFRIGERATE THEM T___T i had to learn that the hard way, it WILL hurt your tummy if you do. these cupcakes are best enjoyed with a giant glass of milk (:
