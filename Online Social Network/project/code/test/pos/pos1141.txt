The sandwiches and salads from Main Street are excellent.   It's not your usual boring lunch fare, but always something fresh and delicious.   Christina's Salad is a favorite of mine and their gazpacho is very fresh and tasty.   A treat from the bakery is the perfect way to wrap up your lunch from Main Street.  I love their brownies!
