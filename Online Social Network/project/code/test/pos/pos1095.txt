What a great place for lunch. Really fresh ingredients, authentic dishes, great lunch specials, and just damn good food.

We started off with the linguica  and pineapple appetizer. Perfectly grilled, not too salty, perfect crunch...just a great way to start it off.

She had the pork chop sandwich - perfect. The pork chop was tender and seasoned nicely, served on a soft port roll and chopped lightly fried potatoes. 

I had the cheeseburger. Perfect balance of char on a medium rare nice size piece of meat, served with some Portuguese cheese and on the same warm soft port roll. 

All-in-all? About 15 buck s person for a great lunch that stuffed us. The dinner menu looked awesome as well (I'd def try the steak topped with egg). Prices are really reasonable, the atmosphere is very homey, the service is great, and the food is awesome. ENJOY!
