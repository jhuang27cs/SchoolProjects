have been here several times and was always pleased, most recently during the oktoberfest celebration in harvard square, beer was very good (the spiced ale) burger was excelent and the buffalo chicken salad very good (though it might have been a little too spicy for some), service was pleasant and quick, so over all we were very pleased
