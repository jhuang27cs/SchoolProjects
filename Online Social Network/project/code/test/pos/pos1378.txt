$3 for one of THE BEST hot dogs you'll ever eat! 

I always order the Mango Habanero and it's always perfect! My friends always order the Hot Link (apparently the spice is addicting), so I'd suggest you try either one of those! You won't regret it! 

Let me tell you what makes Top Dog such a great place to grab a bite in Berkeley...
OPEN until 3am! "Whoooo!" Great for college students who either stay up studying and get hungry at weird hours of the night or for those who stay up drinking and have the beer munchies at 2:30 am! 
SUPER CHEAP! $3 flat for a hot dog! You can't beat that! Again, GREAT for college students since we all know college students are on a budget. 
QUICK SERVICE! You order in 3 seconds and you're out in 5 minutes! This is great because they always have lots of people, especially weekend nights! 
GREAT FOOD! The hot dogs are amazing! The bun is delicious. Plain and simple. You must try it!
