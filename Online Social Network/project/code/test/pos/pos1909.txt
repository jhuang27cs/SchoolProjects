Yeah, they're closed now, so this review is just for posterity.  Kool Korners really had the best Cuban sandwich in Atlanta ("The best Jerry, the best").  Mr. Ramirez was super nice and roasted the pork himself in house.  Sure, some people would say that the standard addition of jalapenos, lettuce or mayo weren't "authentic" (and I had him hold the mayo), but even these griping pedantic purists would admit the sandwiches were amazing.  

Yeah, the place looked run-down on the outside, and there really isn't anywhere to eat on site (except for a couple of picnic tables around back), but these are all minor trifles to taste these legendary Cuban sandwiches.  I'd go, grab a bag of plantain chips and a drink and wait for my Classico.  Sometimes I'd mix it up and get a salami or a roast beef instead of the classic, but whichever one I got they were consistently sublime.   

Thanks for the memories, Kool Korners.
