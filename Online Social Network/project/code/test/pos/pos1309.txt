A cool urban vibe fills this high-ceilinged modern restaurant.  A trendy young crowd keep the energy level high and the people watching at a prime.  Formerly, the restaurant was Cambridge's Ladder 1 fire department, which on its own is kind of cool.  There isn't a pizza I haven't loved here, but just be aware that they are not typical American style pies with lots of cheese and sauce.  Crust is thin, toppings are unique and the entire expreience is full of flavor.  They offer a limited number of beers on tap (I like the Moretti) and a nice wine list.

The decor is simple, the menu is simple, the drinks are simple and everything is mouth-watering and perfect.  Also, if you enjoy very a lovely-looking wait-staff, you'll love Cambridge 1.
