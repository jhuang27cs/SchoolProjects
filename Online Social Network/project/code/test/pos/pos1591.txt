This was my first experience with Dim Sum. We ordered Beef Balls (which reminded me of IKEA meatballs--tasty!), BBQ pork, broccoli, eggplant, shrimp, pot stickers (the best I've ever had anywhere), and red bean rolls. The red bean rolls were the most surprising for me--my fiancee told me that Asians eat this red bean stuff like candy. After trying one of those rolls, I can understand why. We topped it off with a serving of Killer Almond Tofu. I can't imagine it getting much better than this! My only slight complaint would be the small portions.
