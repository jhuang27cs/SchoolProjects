Great food and the price is right. The lamb and the falafels really stand out here...the sauces are great and the pitas are warm and they make everything fresh (even the fries). Also, the service here is impeccable. One trip was with a group of friends, and the waitress helped us make fun of our friend and flirted a little bit, one of which he deserved of course (not the flirting). The second time the owner was actually working, and when my mom couldn't decide what she wanted he was real cool about having the chefs cook her up a sample of some lamb and chicken which he even dashed with a bit of sauce for her to try, which is really going the extra mile.
