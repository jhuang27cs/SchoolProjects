This wine bar is as good as it gets. The food is awesome. We ordered the eggplant dish with lamb, the pan seared scallops, the roasted garlic grilled pizza, and a Bacaro burger. We also had the homemade bread pudding. You won't be dissappointed by the food, wine, or service at this place. The only downsides are the size of the place and the parking situation. It can be difficult to find a seat when it's crowded and the parking in this neighborhood is difficult. Regardless, I still say it's worth every bit of it.
