Personally, I think their burgers are a little better than average... But I think their garlic fries and corn bread is to die for! Plus, on the upside... this place is pretty darn healthy. Their salads are also really good and they give you such a large proportion for a decent price.

It's conveniently located near campus and for Cal students who bring in an A paper or test... you get a free side of garlic fries! :)
