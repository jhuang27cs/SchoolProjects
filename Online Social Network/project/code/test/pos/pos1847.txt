I go to this place when I'm on campus and need to grab food from next door (chicken gyro=delicious), or need to do some work.  They have really, really good breakfast tacos, and they have really interesting iced teas (coconut chai is one of the best iced teas I've ever had, and I'm kind of an iced tea connoisseur).  The iced tea is more expensive than at some places, but you get free refills on the iced tea of the day, which I often take advantage of.
The staff is nice (although one time I was dressed up for a meeting and not in my usual slackery attire and they were way less friendly than normal, interesting...), but not over the top.
They play really good music here (and at Longhorn Po-Boys, as they're attached), so much so that I often ditch my headphones even when studying.
If this place were more convenient to my house, I would come here way more than I do.
