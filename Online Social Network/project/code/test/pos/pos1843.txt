I first went to Shelly because I had heard amazing things about her from people I trusted.  I made an appointment with her when she was at the Carriage House.

I walked in to visit Shelly with hair past my waist.  I had had a lousy haircut six years earlier that left me beyond traumatized and hadn't been to a salon since.  At that last place, it was like the stylist had downed a six pack before hacking away at my hair, making me look like a lion.  And not even in a cool Duran Duran way.

Shelly understood my trepidation, and also knew that I was somewhat attached to my long, long, hair.  At the same time, she knew I was ready to let it go, with the proper TLC.  

At first, she trimmed my hair only a few inches, leaving it healthy.  The next time, she styled it.  After that, she cut a little more off.  The next time involved cutting off even more, with more style.

Essentially, she helped me cut my hair in stages, taking it slowly,  

Today I visited her at A. Quinn, and we cut my hair to my shoulders!  She styled it beautifully.  All this time, she was patient and went at my own pace.  So many stylists aren't sensitive to their clients' fears.  Shelly was a shining exemption.

As for the salon, I really dig it.  Everyone there seemed super friendly, and the room is bright and airy, even though it's small.  The music is perfect for snipping.  Oh, and they're expanding.  There will soon be another room for all hair and spa needs.

Oh, and their magazines are current!

Look, folks.  I would have been content growing my hair forever and perhaps having a steady-handed friend trim it every now and then for the rest of my life.  Now I have cute hair!  I owe that to Shelly.  Get thee to A. Quinn, and prepare to look your mostest awesomest.
