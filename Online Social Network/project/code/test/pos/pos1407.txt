I love Brown University and I love the Book Store too. It's on cool Thayer Street and has lots of Brown stuff to buy. Prices are a bit high for some items but hey...Brown is a cool school and if you want a cool shirt from a cool school you might have to pay a few bucks to get it. I love the merchandise and little coffee place. Nice vibe in there. Busy over Brown Grad week but the staff stayed calm and polite.
