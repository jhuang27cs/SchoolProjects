Best Italian Restaurant in Berkeley, the awards don't lie! I am a regular customer and feel privileged to live so close, extremely cheap for the quality and portions, any menu item + salad + drink only $7.99!!  Gypsy's is definitely my favorite place to eat in Berkeley, could eat here everyday and not get tired of the food! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
