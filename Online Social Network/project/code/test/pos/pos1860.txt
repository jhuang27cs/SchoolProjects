hmmm..so i guess i'm reviewing this place from the opposite side of the star spectrum...i gotta say i was really pleased with my service here. it's a relatively small office and i had no problems with insurance - everything was paid for so i had no copay or anything. 

i have plantar fasciitis so i needed custom orthotics. the only thing bad was that i had to wait for 2-3 weeks for them to come in, but i'd been dealing with this issue for way longer so it wasn't a super big deal to me. another thing is that parking kind of sucks. A LOT. it's a small lot and they share it with like a sandwich place and a nail salon and a bagel place i think...and also other doctor's offices...so trying to find parking would probably be the worst thing about anyone's experience here.

but service at the front desk was great, they were so nice (man i need to start getting names), and the provider was really professional and helped make things fun when he casted my foot. 

i'd definitely come back here for anything relating to my feet.
