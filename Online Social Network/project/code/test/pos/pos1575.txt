Decent Vietnamese food.  I'd say you can't go wrong with the extra large bowl if you're hungry, it's a great deal.  Also try the vermicelli with meat and spring roll.  

Make sure they don't cheap out and short change you on the vegies they owe you for your pho.  They can be skimpy if you order many bowls.

The food is so cheap too, get some wine with dinner.

Do NOT get a bubble tea it'll be tiny.  Just go to Boston Tea Stop after and get whatever you want there.
