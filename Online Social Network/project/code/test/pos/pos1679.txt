The stuffed yam is definitely the thing to get here!  It's marked as a house specialty on the menu and that's no lie.  It's so delicious, my mouth waters just thinking about it.  It's a yam stuffed with fresh sauteed vegetables (no frozen veggies here!) and vegan ribs, topped with "secret sauce" & served with a side of greens and red beans.  The bbq sauce or "secret sauce" is unbelievably good, and the beans -- oh my god, the beans!  I don't know what spices they put in there, but do not pass up the red beans.  The whole combo goes really well together and it is massive!  As an added bonus, they use distilled water for all their cooking and they do not use microwave ovens.  How awesome is that?  Just clean, delicious food, pure and simple.  Thank you, Vegisoul -- you rock!
