Benjy's, I dub thee my go-to Happy Hour venue in Houston!  Benjy's has Happy Hour 4-7pm daily in their upstairs lounge and patio and downstairs bar area.  Although the exterior of the restaurant may look a bit shabby, the interior is decked in modern chic.  There is a sizable happy hour menu with all the typical HH items -- pizzas, calamari, potstickers -- for $5 a plate.  My favorites are the BBQ Pizza (beef short ribs, jalapenos, topped with a fried egg) and Salmon Sashimi.  For some libations, basically anything listed on the menu is great.  I recommend the Strawberry Tini and Blood Orange Margarita.  The bartenders are also able to create a drink for you if none of the listed cocktails strike your fancy.  Beware of crowds during happy hour, though.  Especially on Fridays, it's best to get there before 5pm or else you'll be preying for the next open table.

The dinner menu at Benjy's is also delectable.  Although I think it's significantly more expensive than their HH menu, it's great for a splurge or special date.
