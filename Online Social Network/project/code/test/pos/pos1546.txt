I love to eat here.  It is more like a fast food place than it is a "bistro" though.  The meatballs are awesome and so are there mashed potatos and mac and cheese.  I am swedish and so is my dad and he said the food they serve is the type you would get at a restaurant in Sweden so it is authentic.  Also, when they have the swedish smorgasbord or buffet be SURE to go.  You will never come across such deliciousness in your entire life.  Creamed herring and salmon, and an endless supply of meatballs and mashed potatos, mustard and vinegar marinated herring, sausages and more.  And most important thing is that the food doesnt stop coming.  You can eat to your hearts content and its not some crappy chinese buffet either.  It is presented nicely and everything is super duper good.  How many times can i say that.  I think they only do the smorgasbord twice a year so keep your ears open as to when the next one is.  Its only ten dollars so that makes it the best deal in Atlanta.
