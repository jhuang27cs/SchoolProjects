This place has their namesake down--the hummus is pretty good.  I'm a big fan of their "Hummus Salad," which includes hummus, avocado, tomato, cucumber, peppers, and other veggies.  From what I can tell, the sandwiches are also good--I usually just get the falafel sandwich, which is good, and I've heard good things about the shawarma too.  The platters are nice because you get to pick several sides (the carrots are surprisingly good).  Everything comes with a (very fluffy) whole wheat or white pita.

The restaurant itself is pretty small, so I'd recommend getting food to go, especially if you're with more than one or two other people.  The line can sometimes move a bit slow, and can sometimes be held up by the person at the register taking a telephone order, but food is always ready quickly once you've placed your order.
