i'm a fan, but the food is only a-ok. they make your pizza to order, and it's not too bad, but not terribly awesome or anything. the calzone is not too bad either, but they put on a crap load of steaming marinara sauce, so you might want to ask for it on the side. it's your standard privately-owned pizzeria, nothing too fancy or special
