Simply delish!

Ambiance was quiet (light jazz music and a live saxophone player playing in the background), quaint and romantic.  Great place for a date, anniversary celebration or a quiet night out with a few friends.  My husband and I went for our 6 months wedding anniversary.  Perfect.  5 points for the husband.

We got the pizza and scallops appetizer.  Simple, wonderful mix of flavors and light.

My husband got the steak cooked to perfection, tender, juicy with a great polenta side.  Yum.  I got the shrimp risotto, filled with a generous amount of large shrimps.  The risotto rice was def tasty.  

Dessert was the samborat (sp?) berries --- omg!  I'm not into sweets at all, but this one was amazing.  Light, fresh and left my palette cleansed and sweet.  

Overall, 5 stars!  Def a go go.  We plan to go on a Tuesday night, it looks like they've got a great NY strip deal going on.  Service was 5 stars as well.  Attentive, kind and helpful.  Manager was great as well, you can see he was serious about his career.  

Not a good place for children or for adults who want to be loud and obnoxious.  Classy place.  Take a classy girl there and you'll def win some points. ;)  

(We didn't order any wine and thank God the waiter wasn't mean or a punk about it, given that it is a wine bar restaurant. :)  Great waiter!)
