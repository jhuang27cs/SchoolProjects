Being that I went to Cal for college, it's a little surprising that I didn't see my first concert at the Greek until 2 or 3 years after graduation.  The Greek is just a marvelous place so full of history and great architechture. It also gives you a bit of the big venue vibe, but without the big venue view.  When the sun sets and the stars come out both musically and galactically speaking, there really is no other place like it.  The giant stadium style seats and steps on the outer part of the pit makes it so that unless you have Yao Ming in front of you, you'll likely have a pretty decent view of the stage.  The acoustics are suprisingly good for an open space this size.  It's simply one of those venues that one has to check out for themselves because my words don't do it justice.
