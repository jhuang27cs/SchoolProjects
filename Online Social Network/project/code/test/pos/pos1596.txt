Capuano's is a local Italian place staffed by a wonderful assortment of authentic Italian accents. I love going, even if only to hear the daily specials. (But watch out- those specials are expensive!) 

Capuano's is broken into two sections; the pizza parlor side, and the fancy dining room side. The pizza is fine, with counter service & tables to sit at. The restaurant side is really where this place shines. 

I highly recommend the chicken Marsala or chicken francies. My favorite dish is the ravioli Aurora, which is lobster ravioli in a yummy brandy cream sauce, but you don't get a whole lot. They had this appetizer special once which had huge portobello mushrooms, spinach, crab and roasted red pepper in a balsamic reduction. Amazing! It's worth upgrading to the Caesar salad from the garden (their soups are so-so), and the taramisu is perfection. 

Other things of note: The shrimp are always large and the seafood fresh, and it's BYOB so bring a nice bottle of wine with you. The waitstaff is very attentive, but the food takes a while to cook so be patient. Dinner can sometimes be a long affair. They are wonderful with special orders: they get them right every time and are happy to make off-menu items. They've even made me specials from previous visits no longer listed on their menu. 

A great place for a celebration, or a fancy dinner out.
