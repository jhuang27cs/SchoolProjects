This place is in the perfect location for the perfect price.  Located in U-District it's perfect for the young adult with very little spending money.  

My boyfriend and I found it on a whim when we were driving around looking for a place to eat.  It isn't the best Korean food I've ever eaten, but it definitely hit the spot.  I had their pork tofu stew and my boyfriend had the seafood tofu stew.  We both enjoyed our food and the Pan Chan (side dishes) were good and plentiful.  

If you're looking for affordable authentic Korean food I'd try this place out.
