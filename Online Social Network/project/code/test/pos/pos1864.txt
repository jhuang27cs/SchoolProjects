Forget about the dry reviews...

Myself, as a native Austinite, am the first to curse "Ill-annoy" license plates when they cut me off on mopac, come on imports, at least wave...
We WAVE in Texas, even when we do something stupid! 

I must say I was reluctant to hit some "Yankee's joint" on my beloved drag.

The owner, Jey welcomed my toddler son, my wife and her sister(all Italian decent) and I into his place and made us feel like family. The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was out of this world. I LOVED the garbage bread.

How cool is it to tell the owner to "just do something special for me" and have him whip up an out of this world sandwich.

I found a new place to find a badass sandwich, and it's Bambino's.

Jey, welcome to Austin, my friend!
