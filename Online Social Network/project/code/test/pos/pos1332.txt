I have loved the place since college.  I know that the wait is a pain, but the reward is some of the best Sangria you can get.  The atmosphere is also amazing will of the outdoor seating in the back.  It is a place I still stop at every time I am in Ann Arbor for just a quick glass or two of Sangria.  As for the food, there is much better food around Ann Arbor, but the atmosphere and drinks make it acceptable.  It is the best place to spend an afternoon on campus, or even after football games.  Just be aware, it closes early every night.
