Small place with maybe 10-12 tables, and the weekends are VERY busy, but it is soooo worth the wait. You just HAVE TO order the garlic rolls. They are like little croissants rolling around in butter and garlic...JUST WONDERFUL!! The antipasto is really good, but they also have a salad named after one of the guys there(cant remember the name), but it is a mix of greens and pasta and Oh So Good. We have tried several pizzas off their menu, but to me, the Shrimp Pizza seemed the best. Now I say "seemed", because I have a new-found allergy to shrimp... but it looked great, smelled wonderful, and got a thumbs up from everyone in our party. Back in my shrimp-eating days... that pie would have been ALL MINE! We have been here several times and have never been disappointed. During the week nights, they always have one basic entree that is ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT(spaghetti, ravioli...). 
Parking is limited on the street in front, or there is a garage across the street.
