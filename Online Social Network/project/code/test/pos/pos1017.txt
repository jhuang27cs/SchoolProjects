I don't indulge in many desserts because my metabolism isn't what it used to be.  Tiff's Treats is my choice for the dessert I want when I splurge.  Nutty Sugar Cone ice cream from HEB is the other.  I have yet to try them together but it seems like an awfully obvious idea to try.  Can't believe I didn't think of this before.  Thank you yelp.
