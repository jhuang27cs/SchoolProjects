I hate to review a pizza place after only one visit. If I try the cheese pizza, I feel like I should really give the specialties a try before rating; if I go with a specialty, well, cheese is really the measure of a pizzeria. But the specialty pizza I had at my first visit to Emma's - goat cheese, caramelized onions, spinach, and sweet potato - was so good that I'll go ahead and rate it anyway. I had to wait about 40 minutes for the pizza but I won't hold it against them because they did offer me a free soda for the delay.
