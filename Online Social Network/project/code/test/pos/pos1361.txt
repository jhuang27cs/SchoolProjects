This a good value place that is very consistent. A hot dog place with few frills outside of some awesome libertarian cartoons, posters, etc. I've been here many times when I'm on the go and want a cheap meal. The selection of sausages is great and there is a nice variety of toppings. It's a bit greasy and not exactly a great place to sit and eat and the menu is limited, but that's not really a fault considering they don't try to be anything but a hot dog place. Definitely worth a visit.
