Pretty freakin' good. Here you can get the closest thing in Westwood to a California burrito (my FAVORITE, but that's another story).

Got a veggie wrap but of course it being Fat Sal's, it wasn't exactly what I would call healthy as it was stuffed with oily delicious fries. Eating vegetarian never tasted sooo good! 

Quick, fast, greasy food to stuff your face with. Your tastebuds will thank you for it!

Random trivia fact: One of Fat Sal's co-founders is none other than the actor who plays Turtle from Entourage!
