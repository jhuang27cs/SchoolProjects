can we say surf and turf!!!
i never liked fish tacos until i had them here. it comes with a good white sauce and fresh cabbage. love the fish tacos.

my roomie used to always order the tortilla soup. not a traditional style soup but good with avo, cheese, and or course the tortilla on top. 

its not a taqueria, more americanized.
i liked sitting in front of the big fish tank, but have found over the years that there aren't as many critters swimming around.
