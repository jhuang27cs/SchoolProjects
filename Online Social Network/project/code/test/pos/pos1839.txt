My car wasn't running as smoothly as it used to so I decided it was probably time for a tune-up.  I called a local dealership, knowing they would probably charge more, and they quoted beginning at $500.

I decided to call Honda Zone after all the great reviews I'd read here and the quote they gave me was 300 less than the dealership.  I understand dealerships are more costly, I just didn't realize how much!

The tune-up was great.  My car runs very smoothly now and I had mentioned that I needed new windshield wipers and they installed it for me for free.  

Very nice guys and quick turn around.  The shop is small, unassumming and you might miss it the first time you drive down Broadway.  It's close to the Dunkin Donuts and is attached to the gas station.
