I miss The Ram quite a bit, it is one of the best places to watch College Football in Seattle.  Folks from all schools come here to cheer for their teams and its a favorite hangout before Husky games.

The food is good and so are the drinks, though I'm not much of a beer connoisseur.  Like other folks have mentioned it may take a while to get seated so I recommend arriving early.
