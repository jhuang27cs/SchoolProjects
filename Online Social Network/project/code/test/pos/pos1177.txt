The Village Cheese House is so quirky and great! You'll find plenty of unique European foods. I was thrilled to find De Ruijter sprinkles, which come in chocolate and other sugary flavors, and are great on buttered bread. Our Dutch neighbors brought them from Holland, and it was cool to see that we have them in Palo Alto too now! 

I haven't ever bought any cheese or sandwiches or deli items at this store, which is what it is known for...but I love looking around at everything and buying exotic candy!
