Manas is my go-to Indian food place. You get a lot of good Indian food for a good price. I usually get the lamb tikka masala ($10.95) and either some garlic naan or regular naan. The food has always been good, and my experience with the service has been good. I particularly like their lunch buffet ($9.95) because it gives me a chance to taste some new dishes along with my favorites without having to order it and just hope I like it. The ambiance in the restaurant is nice, pretty quiet, and its fun to watch the Bollywood music videos.

Even when I move away the USC area, I can see myself coming back to Manas or ordering their food for delivery (although I'll miss the free delivery within a 3 mile radius).
