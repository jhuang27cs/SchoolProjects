One of my favorite places in town. I often get something off their specials but I love their Mediterranean Pasta salad (add steak!), the black bean burger, and any of their regular burgers. I enjoy the tacos but prefer to get the tacos when there is a special for them. If fish and chips is on the special menu I get that. With winter comes their chili which I can never get enough of. The chips with truffle salt are very tasty as are the fries (throw on some malt vinegar). I have rarely been disappointed here and if I ever am they fix the issues. The beer selection is always superb.

They are a small place but if you go after 1pm for lunch they tend to have plenty of open spots. Dinner is much harder to judge but usually a 15 minute wait is all you have to worry about.
