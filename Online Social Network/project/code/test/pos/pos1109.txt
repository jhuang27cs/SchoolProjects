A few days ago, my girlfriends took me here. They warned me. It was good, they said. Actually, better than good, they corrected themselves. They actually admitted to me that there came a time, when they both obsessedly counted calories, that they came here every day, maybe multiple times a day, because a serving of the hard froyo was only "90 cals." It got to the point, apparently, where they were buying a few QUARTS of the stuff a day, and getting suspicious looks from the workers, who now knew them as regulars.

Well, they've made a believer of me. I tried both the brownie fudge and chocolate peanut butter hard yogurts, and I am literally amazed that this stuff is fat free and low-cal. Really, I'm not sure how this is possible.

Clearly, the stuff here is not for the healthnut who prefers her original tart soft serve with a dab of honey. Instead, this is for the healthnut who loves sweet and sugar. I can be either one. And in this case, I love the sugars.

Quarts go for around $7.50, which at first was an appallingly high price. But in retrospect, I'm seriously considering going back right now to stock up. Yum!

They have lots of other frozen num-nums, and a wide selection of soft serve, although all the flavors seemed to be the lame-ass colorful ribbons of syrup flavor in vanilla froyo, not the real deal.

BUT, you can get a dish or cone of the hard (& much better) stuff between $2.50 and $4. Not cheap-cheap, but not too bad, either.

Also, this place apparently closes for the winter, beginning in October, so get it while you can. I want some now....
