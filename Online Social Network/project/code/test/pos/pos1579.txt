I am so excited to have found Forty Winks!  I stumbled upon it while walking through the square recently, and I am so, so glad that I went inside.

To preface, I am not used to bra shopping being fun.  As my size is fairly weird, I pretty much have to choose between finding absolutely nothing at most lingerie stores or being fussed over in a department store (and walking out with something plain jane).

Forty Winks was perfect - the epitome of a boutique.  The store is teeny, but they had a wide variety of really pretty things in my size and in sizes even stranger than mine.  I got to ooh and aah over lacy pieces that I could actually purchase.  The atmosphere was also really nice - sexy without being overly racy or impractical.  Most of the things that I saw there would be equally at home either under a t-shirt or in the bedroom.  They were all beautiful and well made.  I think I saw some pajamas and bathing suits, too!

The salesgirls were also great.  They were extremely helpful but not the least bit pushy.  The piece that I ended up purchasing was one that magically appeared after I told them what I wanted.

They don't really have anything that is super budget conscious, but if you want to have an enjoyable experience finding gorgeous bras, I wholeheartedly recommend Forty Winks!
