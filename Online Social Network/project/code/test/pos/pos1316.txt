I hate it when people use orgasm as a metaphor or use it to describe an emotion not related to the act of sex, e.g. that meal was so good I orgasmed. No. You did not. You enjoyed it yes, but you did not orgasm and if you did that would be very unsavory and slightly uncomfortable for everyone involved. (For SNL and The Lonely Island fans, I think you know what visual I'm referring to.)

Well, I didn't orgasm but I did really really really really really really enjoy the bittersweet hot chocolate. I refuse to compare the emotions I felt and the physical enjoyment I derived from drinking said hot chocolate to an orgasm, but god damn it was delicious. Really delicious. As in I couldn't stop drinking my cup and after I finished 20 fluid ounces of chocolate flavored cream, I did not feel bad because it was way too good to feel guilty about.  Kind of like another type of indulgence....

Is it better than sex? Well, see for yourself. And if you don't like neither sex nor chocolate, I think you'll find something at Finale to enjoy, it seems everyone has a favorite. So unless you're also diabetic, you're bound to strike upon something on the menu worthy of your accolades.

SUBNOTE: Desserts are good, but they weren't awe inspiring, at least in my opinion. I also got a pizza appetizer which garnered the same opinion. Service was great, but I understand when people bitch about service since it really does depend on your waiter. But instead of assuming it's a characteristic of every member of the wait staff, rest assure our server was very nice and accommodating.
