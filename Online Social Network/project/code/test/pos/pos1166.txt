4 only because of the awesome happy hour. $2 drinks! although it might not be at convinient times (mon-fri 11am-7pm, when most are working).what sucks is the weird-o balled man that hit on my cousin and I. he asked us about our lip rings, which we didn't mind too much at first, but then he asked if we wanted to test them out. we we pretended not to hear him and asked him what he said, then he got really flustered and walked away. probably because he realized how inappropriate he was being. aside from him, the other waiters have been nice and helpful. the creepy guy seems to be some sort of superviser.
