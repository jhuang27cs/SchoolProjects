This place is a gem.  It looks like a tiny corner convenience/liquor store, and I suppose it is this--but it's also a repository for a vast array of artisan beers from around the world, carrying everything from the best of the seasonal Great Lakes brews to Trappist ales to American craft brews from many of the major breweries.  This place seems to stock pretty good stuff.  It's selection is great, but not absolutely exhaustive, but it seems to have a staff that picks out good stuff.

Prices are pretty reasonable given the convenience: this isn't the cheapest place to get beer but it doesn't gouge you either: you're paying for the variety and convenience.

The people who work here are also very friendly and knowledgeable and very willing to help you out if you ask them questions.

I love this place, and it makes me wish I lived right around the corner.  If you do, lucky you!  :-)
