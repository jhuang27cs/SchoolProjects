Small, cozy, GREAT food, Good wine list.

One of my favorite restaurants - especially as I'm a sucker for duck: their house special (order ahead, for 2 to be sure of availability) is outstanding.  However, I would not hesitate to go there without the duck: really creative, tasty menu and great service.

I recently took a party of 8 there which included a couple of west coast epicurians who opined that it was one of the best meals they have had on the East Coast (in 20+ years).  They are also huge wine buffs and had no complaints (but lots of fun) with the wine list.
