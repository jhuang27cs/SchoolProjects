I will confess that I've only ordered one meal here: the seafood noodle soup. But I've been here enough times, and with enough people that I feel confident enough to review it.

It's cheap, easy, and fast--sometimes that's all you're looking for. But I've also set up lunch here with work associates, and they are very good at accomodating large groups.

It doesn't have the atmosphere that some restaurants have, but you're in The Garage, what do you expect?
