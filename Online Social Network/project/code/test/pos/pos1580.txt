Affordable and tasty salads! Whenever I eat here, I always experience death by salad (in a good way of course!). The only thing is that the ingredients in the salad are pretty standard. All leafy greens, no tomatoes, avocado, beans, or anything special. For their tofu salad, they give you loads of tofu, but the tofu is not too special and a bit on the bland side.

As for bread, I absolutely love their wheat bread! They give you a nice thick, chewy slice filled with a subtle honey sweetness. 

Their fries are pretty good AND they are air baked so it's "healthier" yay! Guilt-free fries~
