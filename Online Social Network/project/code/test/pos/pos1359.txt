I'd probably knock this down a half-star if it weren't for Midtown Restaurant Week's awesome bargain, but I definitely enjoyed my meal here. The cheese fondue was great - we tried both the swiss and the cheddar, and I was a huge fan of the healthy dippers (granny smith apples and raw veggies). The "Signature Selection" entree was good, but it wasn't unforgettable. It actually made me realize how amazing and affordable Mini Hot Pot is, and how much more you get for your money. The dessert was amazing, though, and I can definitely see myself coming back just for this - particularly the Bananas Foster Fondue, a mixture of white chocolate, fresh banana slices, brown sugar, and deliciousness. It blew the other dessert options out of the water (or fondue pot, or whatever). I would love for the dessert dippers to be all fresh fruit rather than brownies and cakes (sugar overload), so I may ask for that option in the future.

As others have noted, this is not a quick meal. We were there for about two and a half hours, but that's the fondue experience for ya. I think the $25 prix fixe menu deal for Restaurant Week was an amazing deal, and all four of the members in my dining party loved the meal (but agreed they'd never pay the regular prices). I'd definitely consider going here in the future for cheese and dessert fondue, and I think the dessert option and dark, romantic ambiance make for a great date spot. 

Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Because this is quite an interactive dining experience, you will get to know your waiter - they make quite a few trips to your table and actually prepare several of the courses tableside. Jeff, our waiter, was awesome and seemed genuinely happy to be working here (even though it was his bday the night we went!).

If you take anything from this review, please let it be the Bananas Foster.....order it. Now.
