Andy has tailored and re-styled multiple sport coats, suits and pants for me during the past two years.  He has a keen sense of style, is meticulous in his work and is extremely reliable.  His prices are reasonable, and work is ready when promised.  I believe Andy is a tailor's tailor and can handle virtually any tailoring problem with any fabric or material.  I would recommend him to any one.
