Olives is without a doubt my favorite place for lunch in the culinary wasteland that is called Princeton.  Ok..maybe that doesn't sound like a glowing endorsement, but really it is!  They have fabulous falafel and if you like garlic then get you over there and have some of the hummus.  In general I found their vegetarian fare to be superior that the meated stuff.  I also recommend sticking to their Mediterranean dishes as the Indian and Mexican stuff always disappointed me in comparison.  Amongst my favorite soups there are the mushroom barley and butternut curry.  If you're in a hurry the pre-made mozzarella and tomato sandwiches are a good choice.  Also be aware that there can be a long line during lunch.  

Oh, and how can I forget...if you think you'll have room for dessert (make room) make sure to indulge in a fresh chocolate chip cookies or a serving of the rice pudding.  Both are worth stuffing yourself for!

There are no seats at Olives so go on a nice day and head on over to Palmer Square and grab a bench or picnic on the grass.
