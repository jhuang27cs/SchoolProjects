I was very impressed with the staff at Essentials Day and Spa, which is inside the Doubletree Hotel. My bridal party and I stayed at the Doubletree, so it was extremely convenient to use them. Aprel did my hair and makeup and did an excellent job. One of the stylists toiled over my sister's hair style for what seemed like 2 hours. Some people might not like the fact that they use this brand of make up called Glo, but I thought it was fine -- the make-up certainly held up all day, which was good. I was worried that the prices were a bit high, but the women in my bridal party assured me that everything was very competitively priced.
