This place certainly delivered.  I have thick coarse black hair and Chantelle gave me an amazing haircut for under $20.  Having rocked a very natural afro for the last few years which has some pretty impressive dreads in the back, she knew exactly what needed to be done.  Three hours later (of which 2 hours and 45 minutes were spent just combing the nappy thing out) she managed to prove that I can get Newbury style for Central Square prices.  Also, she could not have been nicer, she never once showed any discontent having to spend a few hours in the jungle I called my hair.

Caution though--I can only speak to my personal situation, so if you have an afro that needs a lot of work then go see Chantelle.  If you look like Dean Kane, then I've got nothing for you (though I might suggest Brady at James Joseph).
