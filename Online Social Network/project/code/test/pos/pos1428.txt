Yum. I was afraid to go here because I thought the food at the 183 location wasn't all that amazing the last time I had it. But it seemed like the best option on that part of the drag so my husband and I gave it another try. I don't know how or why this place could be any different. Maybe we had a new perspective because we just saw The World According to Monsanto. Or maybe it really was better. But here you actually do have the option to sit inside if the weather's not cooperating and you can help yourself to refills of cane sugar soda (no high fructose corn syrup, yay!) or organic iced teas. I also like it better than Elevation Burger just because they have more options for the non-beef eater. My husband's grilled chicken sandwich was very good and my veggie burger with fries was equally satisfying.

I know that it's more expensive than your average burger place but real food costs more to make. So if you can afford to eat out, you might as well spend an extra couple dollars on something that's much more beneficial for your body and the earth as well!
