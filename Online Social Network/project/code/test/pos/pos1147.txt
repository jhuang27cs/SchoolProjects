I was definitely craving pizza on such a [sarcasm] terrible second day of school. [/sarcasm]  Came in and smelled the delicious pizza with huge NY style slices. I eyed the artichoke and spinach pizza and gave it a try. WITH a garlic knot. Carbs overload, and I don't care! Waited for a few minutes, and got my hot slice out! I took a bite and my eyes got so big because it was DELICIOUS. Ricotta cheese was underneath the goody-ness of spinach, crisp artichoke and tomatoes. The garlic knot was good, but it could've been better. They had made fresh new ones after I gorged down my meal, and I must say I was a wee bit disappointed. Nonetheless, I will come back to try the pasta, since my food buddies said the pasta is delicious. Hot Slices, see you another day!
