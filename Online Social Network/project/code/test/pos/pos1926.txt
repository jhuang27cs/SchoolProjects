im not gonna lie, this little restaurant in pasadena is really bomb. the only thing i tried here was the chicken curry because my sister told me its the best curry she has ever tasted. i must say the curry was very very delicious and on point with their spicy level. 

i would definitely eat here again but i wouldn't consider bringing a big group of friends with me because the place is really small.
