Great food with great, friendly service! The decor is much much better than any Indian place in Pittsburgh.
It is probably pricier than the other Pittsburgh Indian joints. Yuva's portions are normal sized, they are not small! The other Indian places have huge portions. I grew up eating Indian-type food, and trust me no normal sized person eats THAT much biriyani or chicken tikka masala for dinner. 
The quality at Yuva is much better than anywhere in Pittsburgh, except for Udipi of course. We got the goat biriyani and the butter chicken. Really good cooking and flavorful food. I hate those Indian places where mild foods taste bland. Here the medium butter chicken was creamy and had a slightly sweet undertone. The goat biriyani was spicy though! If you are a medium spice level eater at other Indian places, you might want to go with a mild here. It's always easier to add pepper if you need to.
And please don't go the lunch buffet way. Keep it classy.
