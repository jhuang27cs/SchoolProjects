The absolute best restaurant in the city.  I've never rated any restaurant a 5 star before, but ECCO is consistently amazing.  I go in about once every month or two.  I wouldn't consider myself a "regular" by any stretch, but Seth, an outstanding bartender ALWAYS remembers what wine I drink (even when I don't).   I mostly sit at the bar and find myself having the most interesting conversations with the people I meet.   You would have to drag me out by my hair if I didn't get a chance to order the goat cheese balls.  A must have when at ECCO.   If you haven't been...you must try this place. Great atmosphere, great food, great service.
