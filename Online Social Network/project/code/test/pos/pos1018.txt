Coming from a rural area where being vegetarian means you just eat salad finding a restaurant that caters to the vegetarian/vegan alone was like Mecca to me.  So enthralled was I that such a place existed that I ordered two entrees and did pretty well on both of them.

It was a little hard to find being on the other side of the shopping center and it was dark when we walked down Franklin but we finally saw the sign and other diners in the windows.  The setting is pretty utilitarian, not sparse, but a basic restaurant set up.  They did have booths which I adore so I was glad that we got one of those.  

We were seated by a very pleasant lady-perhaps the owner and our waiter was prompt with a tea selection and my water.  He went over the specials and gave us some time to peruse the menus.  My husband looked around and said, I am just about the only male in this joint.  Except for that guy on a date over there who probably just here to score points.  

I had two entrees, neither which I find on the menu online at the moment.  One was a veggie sandwich with a hummus spread.  It was pretty good though could have used a little more flavor so I dipped it in my salad dressing.  The other entree was a meal sized salad with squash that was so hearty and very complex in all the textures and flavors.  Each bite was something new and I ate most of that as well.

We decided to skip dessert there because in general, health food restaurants don't exactly wow me in the sugar and fat area.  If I am going to eat dessert I want to go all out.

The service was prompt, friendly and courteous.  The bathroom was clean, one person user a time.  Price was very reasonable and the length of the dining experience was just right.

In short, I would recommend for veggies who want more than a few odd dishes to choose from. The only suggestion I would have is to add in a sauce or condiment for the sandwich to break up the chickpea flavor but otherwise everything was very enjoyable.
