If you like chorizo, try the choripan, but if you eat ...try an epanada! I had the domino (black beans and cajeta cheese) and it was out of this world. Even after a 10min walk back to my office it was too hot to touch; the shell is deep-fried heaven with salts and spices and the filling was so much more flavorful than 'beans and cheese' might suggest. The choripan consisted of lots of sliced chorizo, caramelized onions, herbs and I don't what else might have been in the sauce or spice mix to make it that good... It may seem unlikely, but the food wasn't terribly heavy; though it's fried, it's not greasy (not that it's a salad, either).

FYI - the empanadas are the size of your hand, so two would be a hearty meal for even a hearty eater. One and a sandwich was waaay to much food, but they were both too good to leave any behind. Also, empanadas take ~7min (posted on the sign, too), so don't go in a rush!
