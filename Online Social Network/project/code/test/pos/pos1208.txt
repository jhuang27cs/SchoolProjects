The Dog & Duck gets a solid 4 stars from me. It really is an American pub that has some British/Scottish/Irish food on their menu. The food is decent but I believe they have the best fish and chips in town. 
The staff - many who have worked here for years are generally friendly and hustle when it is required of them. There is a large beer selection, but I find it to be on the expensive side compared to similar businesses in the area. There is a great jukebox that might surprise you when that song you haven't heard in ten years, begins to emerge from the speakers. 
There is a nice deck and another patio on the side of the pub. It's always a good place to meet up with friends for a pint.
