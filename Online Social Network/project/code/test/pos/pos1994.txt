I got a deal with Groupon and made an appointment to have a massage the next day through their website. I was so happy they are open 7 days a week and had openings. 
Karie was my therapist and she was wonderful. She read through my health history and we talked about my pain and preferences. At first I thought the building was so small, but the room where my massage took place was very spacious. The heated massage table was awesome. I can't believe I'd never experienced one before. 
Karie spent a long time working on the knots in my upper back - very patiently kneading through each one. Then she worked on the rest of my body just like I asked. It was perfect. 
I also appreciate that they offer 30/45/60 minute massages. I can go in and get a 30 minute back/shoulder massage for $40.
