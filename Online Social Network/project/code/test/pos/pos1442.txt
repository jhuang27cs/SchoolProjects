I loooove korean style chicken with the special sauce or yang nyum chicken as they call it. I've had kyochon before and it's good...the only problem is that when you deep fry...things tend to shrink, so when you order your wings all you get is skin and bones...not much meat = no bueno

at bbq it is a lil pricey...BUT their chicken is nice, plump  with a lot meat on the bone and not so fried that theres not much to munch on. YEEEEAH~~ not oily at all! (yes, it's possible with fried chicken) the skin is nice, light and crispy and the meat is tender and juicy. 

I got the teriyaki but I wanna try the original olive oil style. 

They make everything to order so it kind of takes a while...
