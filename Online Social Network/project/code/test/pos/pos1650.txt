15 bucks for the best haircut I've had in years... gave him a 20 and told him to keep it cause I was so happy with my cut... 

its a barbor shop where you feel like a man getting your hair cut... 
they do it all but they really excel at making you look like a stand up guy. 

from now on this is my place in mass...
