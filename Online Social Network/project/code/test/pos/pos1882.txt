Love you for having raspberry, the greatest fro-yo flavor of ALL TIME. Not super psyched about the absence of chocolate sprinkles and cones.  Will I still come here whilst passing by? Of course! But I'll head to the location closer to Porter Square for the aforementioned treats and accompaniments. Yep, they are still getting my few bucks over other fro-yo-places in the area!
