After a horrible cash sucking experience from a certain La Jolla dentist who shall remain nameless (but whose last name may rhyme with old Ed Meese), i have been thrilled with every visit to Dr. Kim. He and his staff are friendly, compassionate, honest, and thorough.

Dr. Kim is not a 'preferred' member of my insurance, so i end up paying a little more, but he is definitely worth it. I have referred both my wife and a co-worker to Dr. Kim, and they both love him as well. 6 Stars!
