Ask a kid to describe what heaven looks like, and they will probably come up with something that looks a lot like Ricky's.  Bright, colorful, and filled with sweet confections, it's like Candy Land come to life.

I was trying to find gifts for my friend's two kids, aged 7 and 9.  Ricky's had exactly what I needed and more!  For the girl, a gift box of every Disney Princess as...PEZ!  For the boy, 2 race cars that can race along the floor and also distribute..PEZ!  Ah PEZ, how I love those little tablets. In addition to that, a reindeer that poops chocolate candies, a snowboarding Santa, gummies that look like full meals, gummies the glow in the dark, and bowls of "Reindeer Food" (cookies for kids).

Yup, I have 2 new BFFs now, aged 7 and 9.  To make things even more fun, I chose to distribute these gifts at the most optimal time - breakfast time on a school day!  Nothing like early morning hyperactivity!

The "Chaos" part of Ricky's is the station where you can make your own sundaes - what a dream.  I am sure they get packed during the summer months.

Great place to indulge a favorite child, or my personal favorite, your own inner child.
