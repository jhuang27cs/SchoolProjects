I feel like I am on a movie set when I am in this place. The decor transports you to the Mediterranean. The drinks are amazing - the bartenders here are the REAL thing. The only place in the Boston area that I know of that concoct, as we call in the industry, 'cheftails' or artisan cocktails. 'They make your drink with passion and attention. They know what they are doing - hard to describe so just watch and you'll know what I mean. The diverse menu is very good but portions are minimal.
