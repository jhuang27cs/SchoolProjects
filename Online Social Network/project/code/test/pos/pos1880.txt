Just grabbed a cheeseburger from there for lunch and I must say I was pretty impressed. Would definitely go there again to try out the other stuff on the menu -- especially the fries since i have heard pretty good reviews. 

I think what was really amazing about the burger was the bun. For some reason, the bread tasted REALLY good, and it was soft. I am not a big fan of bread (hence hamburgers) but really liked this one. The sauce (mayo with some other stuff) was really good too and was what really made the burger taste different. I guess it's either you hate or love the sauce since some ppl wouldnt like mayo on their burgers. 

And please dont compare it with Macdonalds. $3 for a made to order burger is pretty good deal in my world!
