Solid choice for Thai food in H- Square- good value/ $ and a casual lively atmosphere!

  For Thai food Spice is a solid choice.  The Pad Thai is good, the Pad See Ew is really good (they are happy to switch out for shrimp) and the food arrives quickly and has always been piping hot.  They take reservations and the table has always been ready when I was (or the wait was under 3 minutes).  The restaurant is pretty small so the tables are quite cozy... but it is H square so tight tables with limited elbow room is pretty much the norm!
