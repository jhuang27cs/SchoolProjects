At all hours of the day (and night), I could always rely on Kimchi Fried Rice for a solid dish. Toss in some spam and throw a fried egg on top and you have a winner. Prices are great for students (and non-students).

If you're at Asian Ghetto and can't figure where to go among the mass of stores, you can always count on this place for a great meal.
