People LOVED my wedding cake.  They had seconds, and some even thirds!  Have you ever heard that happen at a wedding?? I haven't... which is why I didn't get to have any of my cake.. it ran out so quickly I was shocked.

I did have one bit when I cut it, and of course I had plenty during the tasting which is why I chose Cocoa Bakery despite the very little reviews I've seen about them.  I tasted 4 different bakeries and this was by far the best one.  My family loved it so much we ended up ordering extra slices to eat there.

Grace is professionally trained and still teaches regularly.  Her cakes are fresh, light, and with just the right amount of sweetness.

It's been months since my wedding and people are still talking about the cake.  My husband ended up getting a small cake from her this week for my birthday and it was just as amazing as I remembered.  

I've had many cakes from some crust as well, and this is just different.  I still LOVE some crust, but the cakes are so different I can't really compare them.  I would definitely say that with some crust, I can only eat a small slice at once, but with Cocoa's cakes, because they're so much lighter, I can eat a lot more :P
