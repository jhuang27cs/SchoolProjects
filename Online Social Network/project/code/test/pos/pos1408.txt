The boyfriend and I came here for a milkshake last night after a big dinner and our whole experience was great! (I'll update review next time when we come in for more than just a drink.) Right when we got in, we were automatically greeted by a super friendly managers? host?, which is a really big plus because I think customers should always be acknowledged when they go to any restaurant.

We sat at the counters, and the ambiance is great! Definitely diner feel. It was pretty packed, but not too noisy. The boyfriend recommended any of their milkshakes, since they're known for that, so we decided to share a oreo milkshake. The portion is huge, and definitely enough for two people to share. It was delicious. The waitress was really attentive in making sure everything was alright.

The whole experience was really great; the staff was super friendly. And I definitely want to come back to try their breakfast and other foods!
