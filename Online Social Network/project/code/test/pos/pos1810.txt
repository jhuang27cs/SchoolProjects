As a disclaimer, before going to Jude & Me, I had my hair cut by the same person at the same salon since I was 8 (I'm 23 now), so going anywhere else felt like a weird transition, but:

I absolutely LOVE Jude & Me. It's super close to my apartment (why are all of the other reasonably-priced salons on the East Side?) and at $38 for a men's cut, it's slightly more than I'm used to paying, but I'll take it. Julie was my stylist and she was friendly and comforting but also quick and professional--I think I was out of there in less than a half-hour and I really felt like I had control over how my hair was being cut.

The space itself is cozy (yes, this is usually a synonym for "tiny," and while Jude & Me is certainly small, it feels perfectly sized) and comfortable. 

Jude & Julie & Me will likely be friends for some time to come. Definitely recommended if you're in the Columbia/Harlem/Morningside area.
