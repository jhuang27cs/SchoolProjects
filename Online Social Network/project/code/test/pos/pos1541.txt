I love the prices during happy hour.

I'm not going to lie, I've ordered every roll that is around 2.50, plus all the tempura rolls as well as the Houston and Tiger rolls.  They are amazing for what you pay for, and quick to service you as well.  I've never driven here but I always want to take my family here whenever they come up and visit.  I've just read that they do validate parking, so next time we're in Austin, I'll totally take them to Oishii to enjoy eating awesomely cheap sushi.
