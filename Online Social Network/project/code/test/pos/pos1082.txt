I have to give a shout out of love to this historic landmark which seems to be something the masses have all but forgotten in the last few years. 

There was a time that movie houses were homes for one single theater playing one single movie for a specific amount of time. It was a crap shoot. If the movie did great, you had customers coming from around the block and lining up. But since most movies these days are treated like flash in the pan material. Here today, gone before you can even make it to the theater the next week, the whole structure changed. 

In comes the multiplex. The killer of these type of theaters. No longer limited to one film, you could show many at the same time. Spreading your odds on which ones will bring in the bacon and which ones will be great places to bring a date for some alone time in the dark.. 

Much like communism, this theater looks great on paper. You have it in the middle of the westwood village here. An actual organic small nightlife. And you have people flocking to the fake city night life places like Universal City Walk and The Grove. Yeah, it's no wonder these places are a dying breed.

On the inside, I'm not going to lie, the place needs to be fixed up a little. The screen needs to either get bigger to actually make those side seats worth noting, and perhaps the whole place needs a good clean up. But the memories I've had here. Star Wars screenings, countless premieres.. I have so many fond memories of this place and to see it potentially go down over the years because time isn't on its side.. a tragedy. 

Do yourself a favor and go to a single theater movie house sometime in the future before you can no longer find them.
