Great falafel and roll ups.  The lamb plate is also a ton of food for your money.  I'd highly recommend calling in your order to pick up though.  During dinner time the line can back up and you can end up waiting for your order for a while.  It always felt great to walk in and having my food waiting for me, probably saved several hours over the years.
