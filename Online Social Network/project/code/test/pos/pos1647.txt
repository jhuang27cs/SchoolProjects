Prior to tonight, I was content being solely a receiver of Yelp-formation. But I've just returned from a dinner at Bacaro L.A. and keeping this singularly awesome experience to myself would be just plain wrong.

I'll keep this short and sweet. Go here. Go here with some friends, and for the love of all that is sacred, order the Bacaro Burger with the fried egg.  Savor each forkful. It will be easy to do so; the dish kind of demands that level of respect and attention. 

Try some of the other savories on the menu with some wine and great conversation. When you're ready to consider the three item, five dollar dessert menu, skip the deliberation and go straight to the homemade bread pudding with the vanilla ice cream. I don't believe it's possible to adequately prepare for the first bite of this sublime concoction; the explosion of culinary comfort and joy in the mouth will most likely catch every first-timer off guard. Gentlemen, to be safe, it may be a good idea to bring along a clean pair of boxers.

As you walk out to Union a changed person, having experienced true gourmet bliss over the previous hour or two, say a prayer of gratitude that places like Bacaro exist, and at a Yelp two dollar sign price level no less.
