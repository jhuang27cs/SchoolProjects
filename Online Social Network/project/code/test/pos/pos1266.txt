I like this location a lot better than the Washington one.  Less stuffy I think.  The complimentary appetizers are interesting.  It's not something I would ever order, but it's extremely addicting!  The crispy sesame crackers are slightly sweet, the spicy cheese cookie thing is strange but I enjoyed it.  I think you either like it or you don't.  A lot of people don't.

I ordered the margherita pizza - SO GOOD and so messy.  I didn't realize it til I was done, but I had olive oil dripping down my arm!  Not okay!

Houston is not really a celebrity hotspot, but the highlight of the night was running into Michael Yo (Simmons) there!  Most people probably don't know who he is, but since I'm obsessed with the Kardashians, I know him from Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami, lol.  He's the half-black brother with a Korean mother.  His words, not mine.  :)
