Been going here more regularly now...and i love it !! What's awesome about this restaurant is that the menu is dynamic and they change things according to the season. Since it's winter they have a new dish called congee, which is a rice porridge that is made out of a veggie/chicken broth...delish...brings me back to my childhood. They also have a few new sandwiches.

Don't forget to try out the new curry beef sandwich (which are still a great deal for the price) and the other sandwich with some kind of spicy coconut sauce in it... (watchout for the jalepenos...so fresh ...but spicy!!).

Also, subscribe to their twitter/facebook!! They update regularly what's new on their menu...good eats!!
