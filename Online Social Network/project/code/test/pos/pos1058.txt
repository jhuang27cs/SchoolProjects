Amazing! Let me start off by saying I have never been moved to write a review for a restaurant before and that I am (embarrassingly so) very critical of restaurant food. I actually go not expecting to like everything, just cuz I'm hard to please and don't want to be let down. 

Area Four was so delicious, every single thing we got was simple, yet so sophisticated. Even the beef tongue, YES - beef tongue was one of the best little appetizers I've ever had. The pizza is good enough that they could open their own pizza shop (and I haven't found many pizza shops ever that I truly love!). 

plus the services is great and the bartenders are adorable and friendly. Wines are really good too AND it's all incredibly reasonable. 

A MUST TRY 

Oh, did I mention you can sit OUTSIDE : )
