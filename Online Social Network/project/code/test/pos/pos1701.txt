They have the best gyros I've EVER had!!!!! I am not kidding! they are huge, full of delicious lamb and beef spiced and mildly spicy, the tzatziki is delicious,  the falafel are scrumptious, and I love the fries. Dining in in the expanded dining are is nice and fun during the day, and taking gyros home to eat in private is also just as awesome.

The music is fun and upbeat, and I have been here at different times of the day for food.  Around lunch time, it's not too crowded but the service is awesome,  early evening, still not crowded but definitely still awesome. The hour of the drunks:  okay be prepared to wait, and I am talking about 45 minutes, perhaps longer.  This is the one time I do not like to be there, people  jam into the doorway  waiting for food, and it's only two men running the place. I always feel sorry for them cause they get hit hard at night  when people are done drinking. 

This is by far one of my all time favorite places for food in the U-Dist, and it's m,ega cheap on my wallet too
