Oh, Wheatberry, why have you forsaken me. My mouth waters for your luscious almond croissants. My hands tremble, reaching for your porcelain (i.e. non-paper) coffee cups teeming with rich delight. And my ears long so to hear the kind words of your ebullient staff.  No one else compares. No one with a high chair, anyhow.
