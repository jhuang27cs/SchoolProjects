I have found my oasis in the God-forsaken culinary desert that is the Inland Empire. 

Honestly even if the food sucked (which it doesn't) I would still come here to sit and and sip on something. This place is just dripping with sexy European mystique. It feels like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. (Minus that amazing Pirates of the Caribbean scent that only Disney nuts will understand). Basically what I'm saying is, this place is detailed in a way that only Disney is capable of. It may be that my brain produces a surplus of the chemical "whimsey", but I will never stop drawing the Disney comparison. 

 As far as the food goes: hell to the yes. Great veggie options. I've had every vegetarian item on the menu with the stand out being the gazpacho, omg the gazpachoooooooooo. It is all just 100% incredible. Authentic, rich in flavor and great value too. I mean really, I can't say enough how much I love this place. The service is always good, and sometimes wonderful depending on the server, but never bad in my experience. 

Great first date spot for sure. As in, you're evening will end much more in your favor than if you bring your date to like, Olive Garden. One of Viva's sangrias wouldn't hurt either. Uh oh....
