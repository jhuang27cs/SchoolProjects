The Middle East is the center of my world, here in the Boston area. Joseph and Nabile and their sister Erica have become family to me. When Billy Ruane made this place the mecca for great music way back when, he created a hotspot for creative freaks (like me), a place where we can try out our ideas, research other people's ideas, and be guaranteed a great meal. Okay, so there are some rough spots, too... it's a rock club at heart, after all. With what goes on in those bathrooms... (you really have no idea, kiddies) it's amazing they work the majority of the time. I think a hole in the floor would be more appropriate for the abuse those rooms take. Something that can easily be hosed down.
