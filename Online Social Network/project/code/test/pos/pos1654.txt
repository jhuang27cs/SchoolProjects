Chris Bee is an eccentric dude. 
You'll be afraid for your life when you get in his truck, drowning in garbage and business papers.
You'll stand around idly, frustrated when he accepts dozens of lengthy phone calls.
It's not 'professional.' I may be a very patient person, but I understand that this freaker operates on a different wavelength. I don't think he's drunk.

One of the places we looked at was a duplex. The couple living in the neighboring unit sat on their front steps while Chris accepted 15 minutes of phone calls. It amused me greatly when the girl from the steps walked over to me and said "This guy - I've ridden around with him before. I know what you're going through. It's going to be OK" and walked away.

But listen, I stuck it out with Chris that one afternoon. He showed me a few lame places but then boom: he found me a great apartment.
