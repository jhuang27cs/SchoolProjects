They serve coffee from beans they roast.
They also sell tonics for what ails you made of tea mixes
They also have the obligatory cakes, cookies, and excellent (but expensive) granola.

I made it through a blistering summer research internship in a building without air conditioning by drinking a concoction made of 4 shots of espresso in a mug of coffee....it's called something like the boilermaker...You will awaken and stay that way for 8 hours after drinking it no matter what.

They have more than the usual amount of indoor and outdoor seating and some clean restrooms.  "For Amherst" they've got parking... they have metered parking out front and nearby!
