Man this truck is amazing! it's all pretty  much breakfast based sandwiches. I got a sloppy joe , chorizo patty, hash browns with egg, avocado, and some special onions. It was delicious. Definitely recommend. 

It's a new food truck on campus. Find it and try it out for yourselves. They serve breakfast all day pretty much. Run by recent grads of U of I.
