Fantastic location with a great outdoor patio for those sunny days and plenty of room inside to catch up with friends over a cup of java when the weather isn't so kind. 

There's a large selection of yummy treats and little desserts to pick from, one looking more enticing than the next. The coffee drinks come in huge mugs and they have a large assortment of beverages to pick from. My favorites here are the banana mocha and a regular cappuccino. 

This is the prefect place to have a break in-between all the shopping at Stanford Mall and refuel with some caffeine and sugar!
