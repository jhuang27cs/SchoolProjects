Last Drop Cafe is my favorite spot in the village. (I've been a customer for 5 years)

It has the best espresso, REALLY GOOD soups and sandwiches, freshbaked cookies everyday, and everything is SO MUCH CHEAPER than at the other places in the village, including Starbucks. (I'm a student, so this pretty much the only place I go to regularly to get food).

Mike, the owner, is what really makes the cafe special.  I don't think I'm articulate enough to describe what a genuinely friendly person Mike is, but just stop by and you'll see.  He makes everyone feel welcome and really makes the tiny space of that cafe into a community.  (He's also a really good listener.  Sometimes, I know I could make myself a sandwich at home, but I go to Last Drop instead just to talk to Mike.  He's better than any therapist)

Also, a lot of the regular customers are really interesting quirky people.  If you're looking for random conversation or people watching, I recommend Last Drop.

My Personal Recommendations:
~ice-blended mochas
~BOBA!
~any of the cookies (there's almost always one fresh out of the oven, so I'd go with that.  the large ones are only 75 cents and the small ones 25)
~mike's double-shot with girardelli dark chocolate
~toasted vegetable sandwich w/ rye bread
~brownies and lemon bars
~spinach empanadas
~french onion soup

ALSO I'm a vegetarian so I can't eat these, BUT the Chicken salad sandwich and chicken tortilla soup smell reeeaaally good
