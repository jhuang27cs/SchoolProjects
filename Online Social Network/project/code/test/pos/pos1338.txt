Get the sampler. This was my first true introduction to craft beer. I tasted my first IPA here, maybe my 2nd stout, and easily my first ever goze. Lineup rotates regularly. It launched me into a new understanding for quality of beer. 

The atmosphere is amazing -- live music from time to time. Beautiful people. Service is okay. Can handle large groups. Good for parties. You'll pay for the privilege, but it's always very good. Great food.
