R5 definitely has a DIY feel but Sean can get some GREAT acts up in here.  For example, Jonathan Richman playing the Church Sanctuary?? SO COOL.  (Henry Rollins doing spoken word there also AWESOME).  

Loads of all ages shows that sometimes turn me away, but all in all R5 does a GREAT job getting important shows in Philly.
