So I've always been a fan of Thai Food ever since I was in Austin but surprisingly I had never had Thai in Houston.  Tonight I was craving some Thai near me so I looked on the ever so useful yelp.  Found this place about 5 minutes from my house and had great reviews.  Like the other reviewers this place seemed very empty.  They have a parking lot so that is a plus.  I got the Pad Thai since that's what I used to judge, since you really can't mess it up.  First impression was HUGE portion. Next it wasn't red.  Their pad thai isn't ketchupy? as some thai places I've had.  The meat selection is also a choice meats.  Beef was high quality with no fat and chicken looked like strips of chicken breast.  Will come back again and try something else.  Hope this place stays around!!!
