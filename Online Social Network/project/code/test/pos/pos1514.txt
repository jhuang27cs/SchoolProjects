My wife dropped her iPhone in the afternoon of July 3rd and the screen was destroyed.  We thought we'd have to send the phone out to be repaired, but luckily we found Boston iPhone Repair.    I called late in the afternoon of the 3rd and Ned called us back very quickly and agreed to meet us on the morning of July 4th.    I was just amazed that he would do that.  

When we got to his office, he was super fast, and now the phone works great.  If we ever need our phones fixed again, I'd definitely go back to Ned.
