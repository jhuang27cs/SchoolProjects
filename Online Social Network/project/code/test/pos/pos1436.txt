I vaguely recall coming here at 3 AM in the morning, intensely drunk. I remember that...tomato Sicilian something or other pizza was REALLY REALLY DELICIOUS!

I think I ate more slices of different varieties that night, but the tomato thing is just really really really delicious!! I think it's called tomato-basil! Oh and I have Mushroom and Sausage too! The best pizza in Boston - perhaps it can even rival the great pizzarias of New Haven!

I want to return to this place sober to give it a proper review. I recall it being really crowded, and I saw many friends waiting in a small line. Despite it being absolutely stuffed, the pizza was delivered hot and fresh in about 30 seconds after you place your order.

4 stars because I really need to come back to taste it properly. I'm sure it has to potential to be a 5!
