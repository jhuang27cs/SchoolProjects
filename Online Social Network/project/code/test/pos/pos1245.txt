Fast, affordable vegetarian.  Clover is a great spot to grab a quick veggie-only meal.  $5 will get you an entree item which is enough for a moderate meal.  I got the chickpea fritters, which is a delicious pita stuffed with vegetables and fried chickpeas.  Also had the baked potato, which was seasoned with some kind of sour cream or sour cream substitute, chives and some crispy alternatives to bacon.  It was good but nothing over the top.  The environment at this location is industrial and not really comfortable.  Also found that the tables were pretty dirty and the service counter had run out of forks and napkins.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it had been a busy day, plus the food, affordability and speed of preparation makes up for most of the negatives.  I'll be back!
