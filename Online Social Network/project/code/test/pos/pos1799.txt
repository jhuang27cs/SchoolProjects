Great portion sizes. Friendly service. 

Ordered:

- small salad (awesome)
- eggplant Parmesan (awesome)
- bruschetta (awesome)
- pasta rustica (awesome)

Nice seating area inside. A more senior employee was training a newer employee and was doing an excellent job of remaining attentive to customers while explaining procedures to the new person.

Highly recommended.
