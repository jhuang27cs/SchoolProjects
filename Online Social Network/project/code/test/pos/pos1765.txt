Best dessert in town with the nicest owner in the world!! This place is where I go to when I need a dessert fix for my sweet tooth from hell, or when I happen to be on South Congress. 

Although you can't go wrong with any of the pies, the buttermilk is my absolute favorite and I highly recommend it.  The individual pies are the right size and at a good price.  I hate going there with friends because I never want to share.


If I had to only have one dessert place for the rest of my life, Cutie Pie Wagon would be it!
