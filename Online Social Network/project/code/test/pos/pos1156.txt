This place is already a huge hit.  I waited in a long line out the door for a while.  You are getting fresh quality ingredients for such a cheap price.  I was shocked to see other yelpers complaining about this pizza.  If they didn't notice, there is a sign before you hit the order counter explaining that this is Neapolitan style pizza and it will be softer in the middle.  Hello UCLA students?

If you end up just getting a cheese pizza, you are only paying $6!!!!  For a what I would consider a whole medium sized pizza.  Where else are you going to find that other than Little Caesars?  So jealous of Westwood.
