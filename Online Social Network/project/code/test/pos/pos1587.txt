This is my favorite shop in austin cause I feel like a kid when I walk thru the doors.  They have really cool quirky toys that make life fun and they even serve delish ice cream with toys in it! haha
If you need a pick-me-up this is the place to get it. 
I love this place I think I'm gonna have to stop in today.
