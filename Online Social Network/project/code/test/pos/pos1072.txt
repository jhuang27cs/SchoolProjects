I love this place. Just "visiting" New York, aka I'll be living here. Asap. This place definitely helps to entice me.

Killers on the music, definitely staff-pick. Wood, French Bistro-bar interior, with three open double doors to the street to solidify that atmosphere.  Transient-like populace, drinking coffees to themselves, reading papers, looking for friendly conversation from someone daring enough.

From the looks of the bar, and coming from a well-educated self-proclaimed alcoholic, good selection. 4 tap basics: Guinness. Stella. Sam. Blue Moon.

And this chai latte is simply divine. I will be back.  Many times.
