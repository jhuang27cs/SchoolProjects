Doheny is such a beautiful campus library from the outside, you walk up those old worn steps to get inside and then see the different rooms to sit, read, study and interact quietly with each other.

It looks very big from the outside but once you get in it really isn't. The stacks are cramped and scary. Make out stacks we used to call them. It also often very cold inside and every noise you make echoes acrosss the room like you shot off a shotgun. SHHHH!

Ther are also lots of little hidden study rooms that even after years I didn't know about. The Frats/Soros knew about them as word spreads faster there that anyplace else but me being out of the loop I just didn't know.

With the internet now, libraries are not as valuable for doing book searches as they once were but you can still do interlibrary loans or loans with UCLA if you really need something special.

The librarians at Doheny are also really helpful and able to assist you with any questions or problems that you may have because SC has a great library department.

You can go inside Doheny during the day if you are not a student but after dark you must be a student with a current student ID and if you try to get in forget it, you won't be able to because security is really tight now. Good, I like that fact. No kooks or psychos allowed.
