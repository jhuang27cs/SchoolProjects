I had never heard of the Glowfish truck or of Okonomiyaki before, but they both came highly recommended. No less an authority than Weekly food critic Jonathan Gold claimed this was some of the finest Okonomiyaki in LA, so when the truck was in my area, I had to pay a visit.

What is Okonomiyaki? I lived in Japan for 6 months many years ago and never came across it. Basically it is a savory pancake or griddle cake often made for festive occasions. People sometimes refer to it as Japanese pizza because of the general flat shape and because you can select a wide variety of ingredients to go in and on your Okonomiyaki.

Basically, you first choose an essential meat ingredient. I'm told that shrimp and pork are the traditional choices, but I also had the salmon, which was very good. The shrimp was still better. For accents, I usually go with more Asian ingredients like scallions, ginger, kimchi, and bonito flakes. You can also get more creative and go with options like bacon and provolone. A Japanese mayo and special soy-based sauce are drizzled on top.

The end result is a good-sized tasty meal. Definitely a good value for the money and you won't find something of this quality anywhere else.

They also have Teppan-yaki skewers with rice and salad, which are also available in half orders (and are still pretty big).

The staff are friendly and helpful, the truck is clean and the kitchen professionally run. Your food is served in a high-quality reusable plastic container (complete with a "fortune" on the personalized label). Everything about this truck says quality. 

The only negative is that because each order is custom-made, the wait time can be a little long. But well worth it.
