Pretty good Korean food for Ithaca.  The kimchi jjigae was good, but it tasted like the soup base was made with dashida (powdered stuff full of MSG).  The side dishes were pretty good, but the kimchi could've been better.  It tasted like cheap kimchi out of a jar.  Props for serving the egg custard side dish.  If I ever go back, I'll try the bibimbap and kalbi, as recommended by others.

The one odd thing about this restaurant is the self-serve cotton candy machine at the front of the restaurant for dessert.  Points for creativity, I guess?
