This place is BOMB! This place is a bit hidden in Pasadena. I tried there So Cal and El Mariachi. They both are really good. The So Cal is contemporary flavors. It has  mixed greens (like arugula I think), diced tomato, tempura fried onions, spicy basil aioli and avocado. The El Mariachi has grilled onions, red bell peppers, pickled jalape√±os and melted white american cheese. Also got a side of sweet potato fries and they were overcooked. I didn't get to enjoy them.  Love how they wrapped the hot dog with King Hawaiian Bread, that is soo smart because I love Hawaiian Bread!  The place is a bit small. The price is decent. The parking is behind the place and it is underground. I think it is for free, can't remember... (sorry)

I will definitely be coming back and trying there other hot dogs especially there grand slam (looks yummy!~)  and man I wanted them tater tots because the person next to me had them and I didn't know. I would have given them a 5 star but they ruined the sweet potato fries so one star less.
