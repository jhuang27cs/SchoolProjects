Danielle killed it at our wedding! Kayla and I are Cal Poly Alum's, that now live in SF, and we thought it would be really cool to recruit a fellow Mustang to be our Wedding Photographer.  Danielle was very incognito during the wedding. Seriously she was so smooth that we almost didn't realize she was there (in a good way).  Once the pictures were developed Kay and I were surprised to see pic's that we never even saw Danielle take.  We are very happy with the work Danielle did.  She is very professional, fun, and driven.  She even drove up to SF for our engagement pictures, which turned out great!  We get compliments all the time on our wedding and engagement shots!  When describing Danielle I can relate her to Muhammad Ali when sayings she, "floatslike a butterfly (during the wedding), and sting like a bee (with the photographs)!"  We are really lucky to have found her.  Thanks, Danielle!
