After wandering around Westwood on Saturday night trying to find a decent restaurant, my hubby and I landed upon Tanino.  We checked out the menu outside and thought we'd give it a try.  I'm so glad we did!   Since there were a few bar stools open, we decided to just eat there instead of waiting 20 minutes for a table.  We were kind of pressed for time so we just had soup, salad and desert - all of which were really good.  The desert, an apple tart, was amazing!  I can't wait to go back and try some of their entrees.   My only complaint was my cosmo was almost strait booze!  Now, some of you folks might not mind that, but I had to ask for some more cranberry to mellow it out.  All in all, a lovely, romantic place!  Will definitely be going back.
