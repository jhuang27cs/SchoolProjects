I used to live on Harvard St. right behind this restaurant and would always go there for their lunch specials. I'd say they are really good and authentic. I eat here pretty often when I'm just too lazy to cook. They also have a free appetitizer (sour radish) that I love.

Service is above average for a chinese restaurant. Once I had a dish that was too salty and they took it off the bill. 

As a Taiwanese restaurant, they also have some very exotic Taiwanese food which I haven't been able to find in other restaurants.
