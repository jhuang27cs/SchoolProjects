I have never been in a comic store like Chapel Hill Comics. The atmosphere is light, clean, and welcoming. The space is dominated by shelves organized by creators rather than endless boxes of back-issues. I've always gotten good recommendations when I've asked for them. My wife goes in there alone all the time and always feels welcome.

After I found them, I got a box at a comic store for the first time in 15 years, even though I live on the other side of Durham. I feel like this is the kind of local business that deserves our support, so I only buy comics from them, and never online. 

These folks were nominated for an Eisner for good reason.
