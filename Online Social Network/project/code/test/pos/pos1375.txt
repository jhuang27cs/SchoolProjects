We have stayed here several times and for an extended period of time.  Parking does get tight at times, especially if there is a function at the next door Garden Inn.  Clean, comfortable rooms with a bigger sized fridge in the kitchenette area.  I never had issues with noise any time I have stayed here.  The manager, Donna is wonderful!!  The rest of the staff was polite, and I don't know how they found out it was my birthday but I had a gift bag at the front desk waiting for me!  It could have been because we had stayed here several times.  The beds are super comfy and the pull out sofa isn't as bad as most I have encountered.  Not too far from UIUC, so it's a good location for those visiting their kids.  There is a Jarling's Custard Cup(pricey but very good,IMO) across the street, a Walgreens, coffee place, Subway and Pizza place in the same complex.  The dinner is wonderful!  The breakfast area can get very busy in the morning.  You will find cereal, oatmeal, toast, bagels, a waffle iron to make your own waffles, pastries and sometimes eggs, or omlets, bacon or sausage patties, etc.
