There aren't a lot of choices for full-service hotels in this area, so the Greenbelt Marriott becomes my favorite by default.  I've stayed here many times over the years (ever since it was a rather crappy Hilton) and have found it to be largely the same as other Marriotts.  The recent remodel has definitely updated the place, although it is done in a collage of REALLY busy patterns in the rooms with rather garish hall carpeting.  What I really like the most about the remodel is the better quality mattresses, bed linens, and comforters (much better for sleeping, or whatever).  The new in-room safes also provide a good place to stash the laptop and iPod when you're out  (just don't forget to take them when you check out....not that I've done that or anything).

Recently, the staff here has become MUCH more cheerful, which is really nice when arriving after a long flight.  The restaurant is typical for a hotel in this category, with reasonably good food at inflated prices.  If you have a government rate, you get free breakfast and free high-speed Internet.  (If you don't have a gov rate, you can still get free high-speed wireless in the lobby.) I haven't frequented the bar, so I can't offer any opinion there.

Compared to all full-service hotels I would give it 3 stars, but 4 stars when the Motel - 6's and Holiday Inns are included in the rating space.
