Been here a few times, Food was solid both times, had a few of the specials, ate off the menu, Rocked out. Wine List from my knowledge appeared to be good, definetly in my preffered spending range. Sampled through a few before I came to a happy place. Cozy little nook, Diamond outside the "rough" (rough being the majority of the restaurants on Colorado). Would reccomend to couples but remember its small plates, you will not get full off two courses!
