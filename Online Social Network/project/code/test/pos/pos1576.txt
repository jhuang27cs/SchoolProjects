I was staying in Ann Arbor for just a month, and only needed a few basics. My dad wandered in here and got me what I needed for an incredibly affordable price; it was really nice, too! A beautiful, white, Pottery Barn scalloped bowl; silverware; and another bowl, very Provence style. Plus a lovely framed Picasso!
