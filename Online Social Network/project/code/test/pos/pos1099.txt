oh man, this place is good. Arguably the best bagel shop in UWS and perhaps one of the best in Manhattan. The line can build up, but it moves quickly. I would recommend getting the cream cheese on the side, unless you want a cream cheese bagel burger. They literally put a patty-sized gob of cream cheese between the bagels halves.

The outside of the bagel is crispy, but the inside remains chewy and soft. Bagels, at their finest. If I lived nearby, I would probably drop by every morning. Can't wait to go back!
