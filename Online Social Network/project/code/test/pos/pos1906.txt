I can spend many hours at Moe's (and I have.)  The best used bookstore (the best bookstore, period!)  in Northern California.  An absolutely amazing collection of used books - fiction, philosophy, drama, poetry, classics, science.  I think the proximity to the University makes it especially strong in areas in which most bookstores have trouble filling their shelves (classics, philosophy, things a little different from the typical fiction catalogs of books.)  Four great levels of books.  You'll never get enough browsing done here.  I go on weekends and it's surprisingly easy to get street parking within two blocks or so.  I recommend it strongly to everyone!
