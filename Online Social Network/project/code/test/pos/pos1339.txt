When I want Italian food, I go to Ennio's.
I worked at a hotel for a while, and I sent several guests to Ennio's and they all came back with full stomachs and ample thanks for the recommendation.

Cute decor (fireplace seats are the best), fantastic food, and friendly service.  I cannot desire more from a restaurant.  Try the pazzo bread and any of their pastas or pizzas.
