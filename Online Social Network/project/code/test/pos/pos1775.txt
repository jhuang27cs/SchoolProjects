Mediocre college food at its best! Ah yes, I still recall the first time I entered the narrow dining room with the cash register near the trash and bathroom. The sickening sweet smell of American-style teriyaki wafting the air somehow suited the always-sticky-with-some-substance-that-won't-wipe-off tables. The price, ambiance and food is perfectly suited for the "Ave".

If you can't decide on a menu item, go for the special. It's always available contrary to its name and is so Nasai. (Don't forget the Sriracha sauce!)
