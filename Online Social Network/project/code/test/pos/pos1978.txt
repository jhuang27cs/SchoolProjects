I have only been here for happy hour in the bar. I enjoyed it - the nachos were generously sized and the raspberry margarita was delicious. It also came with free chips and salsa. Their salsa is not traditional, but I liked it. Personally I like this place because it doesn't pretend to be "authentic" or "family run". It just is what it is - American food that is Mexican inspired. 

The prices for regular entrees did seem steep, but for happy hour it's a good place. Probably more like 3.5 stars.
