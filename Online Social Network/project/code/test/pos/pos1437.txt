a bit of mixed feelings about this event but here i go.

this was my first time at monster massive and also my first so-cal rave. i expected HUGENESS and boy i sure got it. there was such a process, the whole thing was a bit messy. everyone was kinda chillin in front.. talkin'.. you didn't know where the actual line was. so you walk some distance and you reach the actual line. but, it wasn't a line! it was a MOSH PIT of pissed off, drugged up, (some) dirty people in costumes all pushing and shoving to get to the front of the line. mind you, the front of the line was unquestionably out of sight.

2 hours later, after a LOT (and i mean a lot) of shoving, fence breaking, fence tossing, fence hopping, etc., my friends and i reach the front of the line where they finally let us in. geez. i tried putting the whole line situation aside and focus on the actual event itself, but it's kinda hard considering it took myself 2 hours to get through. there was NO organization whatsoever.. they shoulda had guards at points throughout the line keeping everyone in check. but no, everyone was just moshing and shoving and breaking down the fences. ghettoooo.

it was pretty chilly, so i don't know why the main stage was outdoors in an oily parking lot. the lights were pretty though, and there were flamethrower things that kept me warm. there was just tooooo many people everywhere.. even for an outdoor event. they went a lil overboard this time i think with the capacity. i look forward to another so-cal event to get a better feeling of massives... i'll keep you all posted!

armin van buuren was sick though. i think that's why i gave this review 4 stars. lol.
