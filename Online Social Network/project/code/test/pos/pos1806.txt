The line was so long at 9pm on Saturday, but it moved very quickly because the servers knew the drill. What beats a warm cookie from an oven tray? Only one thing. A warm cookie from an oven tray squishing ice cream between another warm cookie. Their vegan ice cream is ridiculous, by the way. Try the chocolate chip cherry. You'll thank me later.
