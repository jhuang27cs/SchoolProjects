We came here for another one of their "First Friday" events. (Basically every first Friday of each month, the museum opens up after hours. The "Darwin Revolution" was in town! My husband, the Scientist that he is, was extremely happy to find out that they were showcasing this exhibit.  We had a fantastic time. 

Side note: Two most amazing things I saw that evening....a hummingbird skeleton (so fragile!) and the cuauhxicalli, the Aztec's basalt basin used to sacrifice humans to their gods (oooh, interesting!)

Booze, live music, dj's and HISTORY! 

Another round of 5 stars for the NHM of LA. 

FYI,  $9 for adults and $6 with a student id but...FREE tickets to all "First Fridays" if you become a museum member!
