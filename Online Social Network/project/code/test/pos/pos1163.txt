Guess what?  I am back on the b.good wagon and I am happy!  They have the BEST chocolate milkshakes around.  COLD, frosty, so perfect to sip or gulp on a hot day like today.  The man who makes the smoothies and he also makes the salads is always so quick and efficient and makes a damn good milkshake.  

I get the frozen yogurt in my milkshake, makes me feel less guilty about getting this sugary goodness.
