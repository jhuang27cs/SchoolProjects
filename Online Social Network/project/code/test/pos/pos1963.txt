Veggie Planet has great food at rock-bottom prices. I try to eat entirely vegetarian for at least one day per week (not easy for a Chinese guy), but if I lived in Cambridge I could probably at least double that with Veggie Planet. My wife and I shared the Henry's Special (sweet potatoes on pizza bread with basil, goat cheese, and a few other seasonings) and the peanut curry rice. Both were about six dollars and the portions were huge. I'm a fairly voracious person, but the helpings at VP were generous even by my standards. We liked it so much we came back for brunch the next morning and shared the ginger waffles, a bowl of granola, and the soup/salad combo. I normally don't eat salad dressing, so the light oil/vinegar mixture was great for me. The soup was some kind of curried cauliflower and was excellent. The granola bowl was huge, vegan, and served with generous helpings of fruit. The waffles came with home fries and were quite thick and crispy. The entire meal cost about $20 for both of us. The only subpar aspects were the relatively long wait to place an order/receive food (there were only about 3 waiters) and the fact that they are cash only. They also have a lot of very cool folk music performances at night (at Club Passim, which doubles as the VP dining room on weekend mornings) and Celtic Music Mondays. When we came for brunch, there was a guy plucking Bach's Air on the G String on a lute, which was pretty cool.
