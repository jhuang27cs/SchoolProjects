When I first went in here years ago, I thought I was just at a party where the DJ spins nothing but Bjork.

In actuality, this museum is great. It's a great conversation museum with art installations that typically contrast the photography, etc. It's got a clean, hip, uncensored way about it. 

Just writing this review reminds me that I need to go back... it's cheap too.
