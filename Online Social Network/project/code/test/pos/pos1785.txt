This rating is awarded within the category of 'cupcake shops'.  Its hard to really compare Crave to an amazing full restaurant experience, but with that caveat I can say that this is, for me, the very best place to get cupcakes in Houston.

With two elementary school kids, and my own passion about great food, I've made the quest for amazing kid food a family affair.  Cupcakes have become a bit of a hobby for all of us, both because we like to make them ourselves and sample the various brands all around town now.  Crave is head and shoulders above the other five or so shops.  The cupcakes are astonishing - somehow the cake itself is moist, large crumb and even a bit heavy.  Kind of like the cake in a tres leches - I find this special quality to come out the most in their vanilla cupcakes.  Usually I get cupcakes for the frosting, but at Crave I find myself happy with the whole bite.  

As far as flavors - they are a bit traditional.  Their strawberry frosting and cupcakes really taste like strawberry - not too sweet and very berry.  In fact, I tend to like Crave's fruit cupcakes the best.  The serious chocolate coconut, and the other chocolate death experiences are pretty heavy and intense.  

On top of the cupcakes, the place really has some great ideas going for it.  We ate their one Sunday morning for a late birthday breakfast (yes, they do breakfast cupcakes that are smaller and less rich).  We ordered milk to eat in at the marble table which came in heavy glass bottles, square, and it was so cold.   Not sure what they do to that milk but whatever it is -- perfect match for one of the sugar bomb cupcakes.  They are also extra special attentive to their coffee which is made one cup at a time from beans ground just for you.

Crave is like a simple, elegant black dress.  They don't do alot of different things, and they stay traditional, but they execute the idea absolutely perfectly.  No wonder we keep going back.
