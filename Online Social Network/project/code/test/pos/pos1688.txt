As a fellow Korean I must say that the food here is quite authentic. 
Coming from Oahu where there are many authentic Korean restaurants, this place would fit right in. 

The prices were quite cheap compared to other Korean restaurants I have been to. You get your main dish, a side of rice, and all the ban chans (side dishes) your little heart and belly desires. My friends and I all got the Soon Dubu, which is the hot and spicy tofu soup. 

On a cold and windy night it was definitely what we needed to warm ourselves up. The soup was so delicious and I loved the soft tofu along with the egg the waiter cracked into the soup while it was piping hot! The side dishes were great and so was the customer service. Our waitress was really nice and though it was really busy she never once tried to make us hurry ourselves and leave.
