In Boston's North End, you're not getting an authentic Italian meal, if there isn't a Vinny, Joey, and Tony hanging out in the back.  So what's Pittsburgh's equivalent?  I've been driving around through the more urban areas thanks to Garmin's preference of ease over safety -- and I drove past a Little Italy sign.  Perfecto!  But it just looked like a shopping mall -- and I didn't see anything Italian, other than someone wearing an MTV's Jersey Shore t-shirt.

Anyways, near me was Girasole -- with takeout.  So this review has nothing to say on service or atmosphere.  The food, however, was really good.   The side salad with the entrees was excellent -- with a lot of extras, such as chickpeas, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, etc.  Most side salads are just dumped from a Costco "Bag of Salad," but this was really nice, and could stand alone as its own entree.

The gnocchi was pretty soft and light -- the ravioli tender and juicy -- and the sauces were excellent.  Again, these were eaten out of a container, on our moving boxes, with no wine (spare your gasp, I know).  I think the prices are a bit on the higher end of the 'burgh, and would've expected a bit more for the price, but overall pretty satisfied.
