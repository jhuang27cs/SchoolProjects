Liz and the Swiss Watch Gallery team are amazing! I ordered my wedding bands late...and was uncertain if they would be here in time, but they went above and beyond the call of duty to get it to me in time! In fact, the rings were rush ordered, delivered to Orange County 2 days before the wedding, driven down to San Diego, and picked up by me in time!! I couldn't have asked for more helpful, amazing customer service. We had both a designer band and a custom made band. Both are amazing and perfect for me and my wife. My wedding day would not have been complete without our bands, and Liz did what it took to make that happen. I highly recommend the Swiss Watch Gallery for all of your fine jewelery needs! They are kind, generous, and sacrificing. Thank you so much Liz and all the others that worked behind the scenes to make my wedding day perfect!
