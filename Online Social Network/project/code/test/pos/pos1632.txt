This was really great pizza. We went here after Conte's was closed (my boyfriend has fond memories of that place, though I've never tried it myself) and I can't say I regret the change in venue. The pizza was awesome, with fresh cheese, a nicely charred crust, and thin, crispy, flavorful pepperoni. I did notice some flies in the case but the doors were open and the pizza was good enough to ignore that mostly (that's the only reason it didn't get a 5 from me).
