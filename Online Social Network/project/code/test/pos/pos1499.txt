We love it here! We come almost every week and are never disappointed. The specials are almost always worth having. Great Risotto, pizza, and pasta specials. The staff make the experience. Sarah and Rochelle are the best bartenders and Nate keeps everything running smoothly and keeps everyone happy.The chef, sous chef and line staff are fixtures and for good reason. They can cook. All wait staff including Brian, Jay, Rob, Alicia, Joelle, Jen, and all the rest make you feel special and appreciated. Definitely the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in the area. Beautiful interior. Great location. Awesome wine list. Can't say enough
