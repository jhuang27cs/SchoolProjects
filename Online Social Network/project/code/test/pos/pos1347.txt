This is one of my favorite spots in Cambridge, and by far, my favorite spot in Harvard Square. As the Square's foot traffic waxes and wanes outside, the crowd at Cafe Algiers seems to stay the same - never dead, never overflowing, always enough room to have an audible conversation or get lost in a book by yourself. I always sit upstairs, sometimes on the balcony, but more often, at one of the tables next to the railing looking downstairs for maximum people watching and window light. The architecture is beautiful and the vibe peaceful. Once they were playing an opera (softly) through the sound system, and I almost died of bliss.

As far as food goes, I recommend the hummus plate - their hummus is my gold-standard for smoothness and creamy flavor, and the pita always seems fresh. (If you're feeling indulgent, get the hummus and swap the pita for homemade french fries instead. Yum!) They serve breakfast all day and have other entree items, like a lamb sandwich and falafel. I rarely venture past the hummus (big plate and very filling), but have found the other foods to be just average. The drinks are also pretty good.

Unfortunately, as for service, I've had some pretty mixed experiences at Algiers. Once, my spouse and I waited over 40 minutes for the check (eventually going downstairs to ask), and otherwise, the staff can be flaky. But this isn't the kind of place I go to for the service - I go to hang out, because the place feels like an escape. And the high-brow graffiti in the women's room is pretty amusing, too.
