Mudpuddles won't have action figures from the latest blockbuster film that's dominating public mindshare, but it will have toys that expand childrens' minds. 

Hidden in the Kerrytown shops, Mudpuddles has vintage toys, educational games, and classic stuffed animals. When I wanted to find a safe, stuffed animal for my 16-month-old niece, Mudpuddles had a variety of options and even wrapped the gift for me in a quick and clever way.

Looking for something unique? Fun? Whimsical? Find it at Mudpuddles. How great is it to have a quality toy store within downtown Ann Arbor? 

What's great:
- range of vintage and educational toys
- range of wooden toys
- reasonable prices
- clean store atmosphere
- outstanding customer service

What's meh:
- parking in Kerrytown is limited but it's in walking distance if you're downtown
