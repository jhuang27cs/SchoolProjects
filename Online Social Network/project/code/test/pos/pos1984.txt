Love going back to this place because the flavors are always on rotation. Since not much changes around Princeton, this is one thing I can look forward to. Prices are a tad steep relative to neighboring ice cream offers but remember, gelato is much denser!

The flavors are always very true to their names. Some favs - coconut, blood orange, chocolate orange...

Their hot chocolate is also very good! The very thick & slightly bitter kind - I couldn't finish my cup and ended up taking it home and popping it in the fridge... overnight it became pudding. It was actually quite wonderful.
