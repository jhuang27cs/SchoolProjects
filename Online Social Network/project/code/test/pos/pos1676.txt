When you go somewhere especially when you're not familiar with the town you want #1, good location, #2 friendly service, #3 great atmosphere, #4 good product, #5 great value. Well that is exactly why I gave this 5 stars. 

I'm writing this review for people who are not locals (like us) who are visiting. a block from downtown and where we parked. The woman that helped us was probably one of the nicest people, she gave us suggestions for dinner, grabbed us a paper to show us music scene for the night, chilled our bubbles for us to take home. So friendly! The atmosphere is great, you can sit by the window and actually forget that there is so much going on behind you. We had a girls day and this was the perfect end to the day/segway into the evening. We ordered a granache, chevre cheese and bean spreads...delish with all of them. Inspired me to make some of this stuff at home now. Seriously if i went to school here or lived nearby I would be here all the time, what a steal/deal! I dont htink there was anything over $25/bottle. I brought a $13 bottle home and my dad who is a big wine-o loved it!

Next time I'm in town i will definitely go here, everyone should check it out. So convenient to a leisurely afternoon without having to drive all over to wine tasting shops elsewhere.
