We used Norcal to put in floors for about 1300 sq ft of our home.  In general, they were easy to work with and the quality of the work good.  We had few minor issues and some disorganization toward the end of the job, as well as a few spots where they could have payed slightly more attention to detail.  

That said, those issues are minor and they fixed essentially everything I pointed out to them.  The price was reasonable compared to some other quotes I got (in line with a few, lower than others) and they stuck to their original estimate plus a couple of things that got added on (i.e. vents to match the floor).  I'd recommend them to a friend...I'd just tell the friend to be proactive in reviewing and managing resolution of details.

All in all, a good experience and I'd use them again.
