Pagliacci is good, but has anyone noticed that their slices are getting smaller and the prices are getting higher? Hmmmmm....Well, what I can say about Pagliacci's is that they are a Seattle institution that is basically rated NO. 1 PIZZA every year (and in a row). I like Pagliacci, but at the same time, I feel like they are a little overrated. The U-district store is a little daunting because it's slightly dark and the dining area is not very well-planned out. Check out the Capitol Hill store, it's money. They have gelatto there, more salads and a cute dining room with outdoor seating in the summer. It almost reminds me of being in Vancouver, and that is a beautiul thing.
