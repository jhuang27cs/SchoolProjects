Came in on a quiet week night.  Husby tried the half-rack Philthy Phil's ribs and I tried the shredded pork sandwich.  His ribs were total rib-by goodness!  It's got a lovely mustard-vinegar sauce on it, which gives  a tanginess and sweetness.  His sides were beans and coleslaw, both of which were pretty good.  His entree also came with a corn muffin and honey butter- yummy!  I wish my sandwich tasted better- I wasn't a fan of their sauce- Mack's up in San Carlos (Bay Area) makes a much better sandwich and sauce.  The entree also comes with coleslaw- you can ask for it on the side, which I did- and a choice of a side.  I wish I could have ordered the other kinds of ribs- you actually can order their  kinds of ribs in an entree- and their fried green tomatoes.  I guess when I drive down 101 again I'll have to give it a shot!
