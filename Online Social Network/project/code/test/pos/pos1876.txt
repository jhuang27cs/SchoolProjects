On the first day there were biscuits, fried chicken, ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens.  On the second day there were biscuits, fried chicken, ribs, mac and cheese, collard greens, and an order of biscuits to go.  On the third day I rested...but on the fourth day there may be biscuits, fried chicken, ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens.  Yes, I went there twice...two days in a row, in fact.  And I ordered the same combination platter to share with my mate both times.  I have yet to try Dinasour bbq but the bbq ribs at Rack and Soul top any that I have had in New York so far.  Reasonable, filling, and delicious...the three requirements to get a five star rating from me!  Woohoo for Rack and Soul!  Did I mention their biscuits are the best thing since sliced bread?  Because they are.
