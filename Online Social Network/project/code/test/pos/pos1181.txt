Oh Diddy Riese, my def pick me up after taking midterms/finals.. Lines get crazy on peak hours, but 1.50 for an ice cream sandwich or 5 bucks for a dozen cookies.... dude that's a really good deal. A week or two later, it's still edible! lol btw this place is cash only too. If you have family/friends visiting, this is absolutely one of those spots that you HAVE to take them to. :) I always bring a dozen home for my mom and baby sister who gobble them up in one sitting.


My forever favorite is the one and only chocolate white chocolate chip cookies. with strawberry cheesecake ice cream. Mmmmmm. that and the basic chocolate chip. I'm not a fan of nuts in my cookies, but everyone else I know digs the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie!
