I had seen their little car around town and they had free delivery so I just went for it. I looked over their menu and was a bit overwhelmed cause they have  a loooot of options. 

Personally I feel if a place can get the buffalo wings right in my book, I'm sold, so I got 2 orders of medium buffalo wings (about 10-12 wings per order). The wings were really juicy and meaty so that was a major bonus. The buffalo sauce started flavorful but slowly I started feeling the spicy bite, so that was pleasant. I left the delivery container open on my desk for a while so my first wings were only warm but the bottom ones were nice and hot even after a while. 

I didn't try the bleu cheese dressing/dip that comes with the wings cause I really don't like bleu cheese at all. I will say that the little container is certainly not enough dip for all those wings, so I guess you can ask for an extra container or two when you order. 

Sadly, the celery looked kind of ugly and not very fresh, which is a bummer because wings go with celery sticks perfectly for me. 

Overall, I am pretty excited to try more stuff off their menu, especially because of the free delivery till 2 am and till 4 am on weekends. I need a good place for late night munchies deliveries!
