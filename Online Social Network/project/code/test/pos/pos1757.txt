Today, according to Wendy's ad campaign, I did "what tastes right."  But I could have achieved the same effect by raising Dave Thomas from the grave to punch me in the stomach.  Seriously, what am I doing to myself?  Naturally, I come here for reasons Jake M. so eloquently touches upon in his review, but I am also a sucker for special new menu items posted in huge colorful photos in the windows.

Had the 1/2 Pound Bacon Cheddar Double Melt with fries and a Frosty for $6.39, easily over 1,000 calories and 2,000 mg of sodium.  That's what I'm talking about.  It's like, screw the New Year, I'm going to eat two square meat patties smothered in processed cheese.  The patties were more rhomboid, actually, and the cheese reminded me of a mix of Banknorth Garden nacho cheese and the kind they pump on Arby's roast beef.  In other words: brilliantly executed.

At 1:30 the line was huge, and it remained constant as I took a seat and attacked my stomach with each bite.  This place sees some serious business, and they're open late--at least till midnight.  I will only come here until the gift card I have runs out, so I have to choose my meals wisely, but I think next time I'll try one of their new "healthy" offerings, the Roasted Turkey & Basil Pesto Frescata with a Tums chaser.
