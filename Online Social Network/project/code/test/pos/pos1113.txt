So. Delicious. I've been twice. The first time I got french toast, which was very well balanced. The eggs and the sweetness were pretty great together, and the bread itself was thick and a good way to convey the batter into my body. The second time, I got a slightly customized seafood omelette. I'm from California, so I can be picky about seafood, but their smoked salmon is awesome. The harvest muffin is also not to be missed. Drawbacks: a bit pricey, and service can be a bit slow if it's busy, which it usually is. The first time I went there, the chef punched a hole in the microwave with his fist and we had to wait for them to clean the kitchen and throw out all the produce. However, the food was still so good that I went back, which I think should say a lot.
