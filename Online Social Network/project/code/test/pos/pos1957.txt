I find Cynthia to be very friendly and accommodating.  I don't expect to go in and spend a long  time visiting---I would love to , but that's her time for producing.' I have been a customer since she opened her business and hope she stays in business a long time.
Her work is very nice.
I worked for the public and can appreciate some attitudes in dealing with people.
