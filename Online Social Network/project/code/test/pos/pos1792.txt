I had a 10ft x 3.5ft paper banner with a full color image background to produce on a Saturday that I needed same day. I called several places, but they were either too expensive or not open on Saturday. I uploaded the very large file at 1:30pm, nervous that they wouldn't be able to produce it by closing time at 6:00pm. Khalil, the owner, was very nice but told me they had several rush jobs and asked if I could pick it up on Sunday, which I couldn't. So he said they'd do it, and the price he gave me was totally reasonable; with the Yelp coupon, it cost $20 less than the quote. I got an email that it was ready at 3:30pm!!  The banner quality is beautiful -- nice, thick paper and great color. I'm totally pleased, as well as grateful. I will definitely use them again.
