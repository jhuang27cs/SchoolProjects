I love this place. Even the simplest deli sandwiches are a great lunch. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. They don't mind is you are a picky eater and never has gotten my order wrong. The people there are very kind and like to talk to you. Super inexpensive which is important to me. 

I recommend the Hummus (+ some pita bread). Probably the best I've ever had at Cal. 

the only this bad is that they run out of food after the lunch rush sometimes. But it's not their fault that they are so in demand. haha.
