If you like Cinnabon, you'll LOVE Cinnaholic! You'll be even more appreciative if you're Vegan and the only taste of Cinnabon that you've had is from the sweet cinnamon essence that permeates every mall that it's located in. 

Even if you're not Vegan, Cinnaholic is better in every way with it's exquisitely homemade flavor coupled with perfectly baked dough. Just sweet and delectable enough without knocking you into a diabetic coma. Come to think of it, comparing the two is doing Cinnaholic an injustice. The student has become the master. It is that good!

The daily special is always a good bet since it's a dollar less from their other specialty rolls. Or if you prefer, you can create your own masterpiece utilizing the variety of toppings available. 

I'm not sure it really matters what the topping is, I'm pretty sure you'll leave satisfied unless you happen to be an insatiable dessertaholic. These large doughy morsels are addictive! Whatever trouble you may get into after devouring one of these bad boys, Cinnaholic should not be held liable. 

Service isn't overly friendly but it's sufficient. No bathroom that I saw and there's only a few chairs outside. Its probably a better grab 'n go option so you can hit up a coffee shop and savor it there.

Pro Tip: Check in for one free topping or frosting. Not that you need any more decadence in your life.
