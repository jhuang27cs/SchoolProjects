My friends that frequent this resto claims it as their favorite.  The interior was pretty meh, but was a poor comparison to how delicious their food is.  They have an extensive cocktail menu and a well rounded food menu.  

I had one of the specials, a meat plate with warm olives and cheese stuffed fried zucchini flowers.. i died.
