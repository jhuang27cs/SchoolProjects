This review is solely for the quinoa salad! I think this is the most refreshing, healthy salad you could possibly taste. I was just so delightfully minty, and crunchy, and extremely healthy but does not taste healthy. The more you eat the better it gets.

Knocked off a star because when we got there, they were having some event, and the lady rudely was like "i dont have any tables," and because none of the other food we got was worth mentioning. (Veggie burger and house salad)
