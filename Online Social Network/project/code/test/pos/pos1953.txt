So glad they made the jump over the cascades. I officially have no reason to stop in Ellensburg anymore. (Other than the fact that my sister goes to school there, whatever.) 

Just walking in the door, it has the same college hangout vibe that the original location offers. Music, hi def tvs in every booth, as well as 8 huge tvs mounted on the wall and a giant projector. 

Let's face it, the waitresses are hot little broads. They're super nice, too.  A few of them transferred over from the E-burg location, so they know their products well. 

They offer a "class" called Beer 101 where you pay something like $340 which acts as a payment to taste all 101 beers they have to offer. Finishing this wins you an etched mug, a t-shirt, and a plaque on the wall. Wearing said t-shirt certain days of the week gets you discounts. (Once you graduate,  you can go on to Beer 202, 303, etc. Do you get more college than that?)

Wings are delish. I suggest the Samurai. 

Overall, a great place for this area. I don't feel like there's anything like it around here. I hope it thrives. 

Cheers.
