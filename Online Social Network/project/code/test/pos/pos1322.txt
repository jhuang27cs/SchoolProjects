Most Pizza is ok.  Who really ever has bad pizza?  So to me it really takes  some stuff to go right for me to give it a 5 star rating.  When it comes down to it, this place is better than everyone based on their crust.  It's doughy, its crunchy, its really something else.  The price per slice is all dirt cheap....Mulberry to me comes close, but I've had slices there that were sometimes ok, Lamonica's is always good.
