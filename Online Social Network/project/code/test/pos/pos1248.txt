bottom line:
cheap, good korean food

details:
decided to try this place out, very much happy with it. ordered the gushi special (bulgogi) and it was great. huge portion of food (was enough for a filling lunch the next day). the chicken teryaki was great, but make sure to add plenty of teryaki (IMO). seating area is good when people clean up after themselves.
