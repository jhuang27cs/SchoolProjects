I love Buster Posey!
The catcher, haven't tried the sandwich yet.

I love Matt Cain!
The pitcher and the sandwich.  Matt Cain is a solid sandwich, I've had it twice and it was just as exciting and delicious as the first time.

I love Tony Soprano!
The sandwich.  Whatever they do what they do to the salami is insane!!

I love Ike of Ike's Place.
And I've met him too...I don't know why I was so star struck.  Quite a handsome gentleman too.  "Love to you" too Ike!

I love Ike's Place!
Just not a fan of this location.  Not sure why Ike picks these selective, off the wall, locations that caters to a select group of individuals, i.e. Stanford and Redwood Shores.  I still love the sandwiches though...damn it for making me drive out of my way and burn some super unleaded gas.

If you're unfamiliar with the campus, it can be a little hard to find, unless you happen to be one of the thousand geniuses that attend Stanford, then, it's simple as "Pi."

Same rules apply as Redwood Shores, call in your order!  We went on a Sunday afternoon thinking it'd be quiet and no, it definitely wasn't.  However at this location, the price includes a bag of chips, which is why I was wondering the menu was like a buck more here.
