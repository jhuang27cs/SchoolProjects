Noda is one of the best sushi places! We go there all the time and the fish is always fresh, the service is wonderful, and we love the new place. 

It's really an unknown gem, but more people should eat here. 

I really like the Crunch Spicy Tuna Roll, but the Salmon Sashimi is always great, as well as the Halibut Mint Tempura.

Definitely a place to get sushi in Pasadena - so much better than those cheap places or expensive places, like Sushi Roku.
