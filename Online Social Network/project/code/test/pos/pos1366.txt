Interesting dining concept. It is either a hit or a miss for diners. Either you hate it or you love it.

I love it. The pizza is really good. I got the San Gennaro Pizza. However, it is a bit pricey. I am not sure why. The ingredients are fresh, but it doesnt mean you could charge 20 dollars something for a 14" or 13" pizza right?

The price is a 3 star. The pizza a 4.5. I really think that they're dough is a little bit too charry for my taste, but that could just be my pizza.

Maybe I'll come to Antico again when I'm in atlanta again.
