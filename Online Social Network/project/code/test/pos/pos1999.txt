I was shocked by how good the food was.  We went in knowing almost nothing about the cuisine, and basically asked the staff to recommend four different popular dishes and an appetizer.  Everything was distinct from neighboring county's foods, and really tasty.

Clearly a labor of love from the staff, who all spoke limited English.  

We spent MAYBE $20 a person, and left stuffed with leftovers.  

The place was 2/3rds empty, and I hope they get more business from this review -- I was impressed.
