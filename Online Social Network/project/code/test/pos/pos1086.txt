I've been coming to Angelos since I was here at U-M as an undergrad, and am happy to report that nothing much has changed. It's still packed during the school year, with lines that stretch out the door. 

Angelos is only open for breakfast and dinner, until 3 if memory serves. They have a lot of 'famous' dishes, such as the deep fried French toast, but since I prefer savory, I always go with an omelet. For $8.75, you get an omelet with 4 fillings (including cheese) which comes with toast. Their bread is homemade, and they offer white, wheat, or raisin (which is a $.75 upcharge, but worth it). The omelets do not come with potatoes, but if you're a lumberjack and can put it away, I recommend ordering the potatoes (which are cubed and grilled, not grated or sliced) with the added onions, peppers and cheese - really delicious. 

My husband is more of a lunch person, so when we go he always orders the Rueben with a side of sweet potato fries. It is a robust sandwich, and tastier if you order it with slaw instead of kraut. I'm also a fan of the chicken salad, which you can get fried or grilled, with some delicious homemade ranch. 

You might have to wait to get a seat, but you won't walk out hungry.
