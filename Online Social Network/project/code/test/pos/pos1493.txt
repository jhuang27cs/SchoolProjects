Dogma Catmantoo is a great addition to Ann Arbor. Like the previous reviewer mentioned, it's not the place to get an item you can easily pick up at Petco or Target, but it is a great place to find unique and fun items for the pet enthusiast. It's also definitely not cheap. However, everytime I've stopped there, I've found either a great gift (cat themed nail files/fur remover), a health aid for my pet (malt flavored hairball remover) or a new accessory (cat litter mat that I adore!) The owner is a veterinarian, so if you have questions about your pet, she's a definite expert. I've encouraged her to increase the cat items in her store, and she has done so in the new, larger Dogma Catmantoo space.
