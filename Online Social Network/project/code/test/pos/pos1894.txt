Please do not walk into this theatre and expect stadium seating, fresh popcorn, and non-squeaky chairs. No, that is not what this theatre is about. 

Regency is for the movie lovers, the ones that truly just love to 'go see a movie' minus the crowd, minus the long walk to the concessions, minus the high ticket price. 

More so, I love that when nobody else wants to see a movie or has other plans, I can walk into this theatre alone and not feel awkward or silly.  Also, the free parking in the back is a major plus.
