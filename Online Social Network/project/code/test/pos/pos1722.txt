Sandwiches are surprisingly underrated, they have huge stuffed sandwiches for around 10 bucks. I personally really like the turkey club! The ambience is pretty cool, with bar lights and bar seating everywhere. it is surprisingly dead most of the time, but on tuesdays they have really great beer specials. i would definitely recommend you check it out!
