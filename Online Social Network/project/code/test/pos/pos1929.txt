This is a very close second behind Wegman's for amazing food/etc. destinations. It has everything, is well stocked with coffee/tea, prepared foods, cooking tools/utensils, place settings, wine, groceries and flowers. They should have apartments upstairs since this place is like a small village. I make sure I have plenty of time to wander and taste and look. Fellow foodies, heaven is in Chapel Hill.                        

PS. Yelp has the worst customer service on the planet.
