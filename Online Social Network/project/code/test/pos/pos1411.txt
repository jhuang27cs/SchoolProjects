Definitely much better than the other Main Street Venture italian restaurant across the street, but the fluctuations in the quality of their entrees keep this from being a 5-star place.  If you are strictly looking for the best italian in Ann Arbor, you'd have to go to Paesano's.  But what would attract me to go here on occasion is their great location downtown.
