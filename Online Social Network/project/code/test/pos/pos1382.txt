Sounds of planes flying by and ol'military war planes sitting on the tarmac.  Gotta Love this place. 
     The airport actually made a parking area for several vehicles and placed a bench for people to sit down and watch landings and take offs just 50 feet from where you are at.. 
           This is so cooool and they had to actually put signs on the roadway...that says low flying aircraft... 
            I could sit here for hours just enjoying the different aircrafts doing their flying lessons on touch and go...
           Bring your burger and fries and sit on your tailgate and watch all the fun.  Awesome takeoffs at sunset into the colorful sky!!!
