Went on Sunday 1/31/2010 for Lunch. 

Beer was Brown's beer, I think if you like it or not is a personal taste issue. I had the Pale Ale I thought it was fine, I have also had the Pilsner, it's good as is the Dunkel.

The food was rather good for a brew pub. I got the Reuben, and although it was bastardized (no sauerkraut = NOT A REUBEN), I'll forgive it because it was well put together and the corned beef was actually pretty decent and I am corned beef snob (See Sam Lagrassa's, Boston). The beer batter fries are perfectly fried and have a nice crunch. Nice to see some different fries when everyone seems to be serving straight foodservice fries exclusively these days. Wifey got a Southwestern wrap of some kind that was rather good.

We will be back......
