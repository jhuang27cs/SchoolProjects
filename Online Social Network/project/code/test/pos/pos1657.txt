In a mysterious way, Felipe's keeps me coming back.  The staff rushes you through the line, making you feel like they're herding cattle rather than serving people.  The chairs and tables are old, usually not clean, and are on the verge of falling apart.  The menu is limited, and you can only pay with cash.  But, in a weird way, I like this place!

The chorizo burrito is to die for, and the restaurant's salsa bar is second to none.  Whether you're looking for a quick bite or to satisfy your late-night drunken munchies, Felipe's is a diamond in the rough in Harvard Square.  Growing up in southern California, I think I know a thing or two about good Mexican food.  So far Felipe's is the best I've found in Harvard Square.
