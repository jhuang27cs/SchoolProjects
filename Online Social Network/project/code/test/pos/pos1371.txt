I really love this place, and I'm actually kind of surprised it's gotten some poor reviews.  It has two stories full of clothes!  I don't know of any other vintage shop in the East Bay that can even compare to this.  Today I counted one-two-three-four-five full racks of really cute dresses, all organized by decade!  I couldn't decide between two I really loved, so they cut me a deal if I took both.  Yay!  And they taught my boyfriend how to put on a tie, too.  How sweet is that?  Oh, and while I was upstairs earlier, looking through their skirts, this smiley girl asked me if I needed any help.  So, yeah, I totally agree with Vanessa:  the customer service at this place has really changed for the better.  Friendly service, lots of pretty dresses and shoes, two floors of fairly nice vintage clothing, reasonable prices.  I would give it four stars, but I'm giving them five for playing The Jam while I was shopping today.  I'm a Mars fan, for sure.
