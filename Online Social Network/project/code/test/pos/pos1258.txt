Very impressive hospital.  All the staff, from the custodians to the cafeteria workers to the nurses to the doctors seem genuinely happy to be there.  They were all friendly, professional and attentive.  The hospital was clean, comfortable (I stayed with my son on the pull out couch in his private room for 3 nights) and the food in the cafeteria was very good and reasonably priced.  The responsiveness of the nursing and nursing assistant staff was very quick.
