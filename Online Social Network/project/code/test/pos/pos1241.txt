I was referred to SLOtography by a friend and could not have been more pleased.  We hired Blake to take some family photos and everything turned out absolutely perfect.  Blake made the photo shoot fun, fast and easy.  It was the first time in several years our family did this type of thing but we all had such a good experience we decided to keep doing it with SLOtography on a regular basis.  Blake is very fun, easy going, and professional and the experience inspired everyone in our family to make a tradition out of it.    I honestly cannot recommend SLOtography enough.
