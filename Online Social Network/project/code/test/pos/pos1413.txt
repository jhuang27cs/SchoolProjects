Cozy and off the beaten path, Baraka Cafe is something special.  I can get my North African food fix and finish with creme brulee for dessert.  When I found out I could speak French with the proprietress, I was duly smitten.

The menu is short and doesn't change much, but the standbys are excellent and worth return trips.  Dishes I love:
Zaatar Coca.  The smoked salmon coca is even better -- check the specials.
M'Katef.  More like mmm'katef!  This is my favorite: lamb, saffron, mint, leeks, and a tiny but divine almond tartlet.  (I am such a bloodthirsty lamb fiend, and Baraka satisfies my sanguinary tendancies.)  

And the best lemonade EVER.
