Let's call a spade a spade. This is quality standard gastropub - probably what wikipedia could easily advertise as a example of gastropub but IT WAS NOTHING SPECIAL.

Good food (i had the chicken. my friends had the scallops) with very reasonable portions at an average price. The wine selection was quality but nothing super amazing. The host was friendly, but nothing too exciting to advertise.

Essentially, this is the stuff you would see in a romantic comedy with Scarlett Johanson. Delightful.. but nothing to memorable.
