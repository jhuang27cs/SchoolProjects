I don't eat hamburgers.  I actually don't eat much meat at all.  Just seafood.  So what do I eat a burger joint?

Well, french fries, of course.  Now, I  wouldn't make a meal of french fries every night, but you can make an exception for french fries this good.  So golden and delicious you can overlook that they are maybe a bit too greasy.  For a burger joint, that just seems right.  "Hand cut" and with the skin left on, these are fast food fry perfection.  Pair that with some wonderful milkshakes and you've got a darn enjoyable meal.  I've tried the strawberry, vanilla, and oreo frappes and I've not been disappointed.  (though the oreo milkshake has maybe too many oreo bits in it)

I can't tell you first hand how good the burgers are, obviously.  Our first time there, my girlfriend seemed unmoved by her patty but on successive visits she's been nothing but happy with them.  Might just be a matter of controlling expectations.

The biggest problem here is the space.  Just not enough of it.  This is a very popular establishment and I've never visited at a time we didn't have to jockey for a table.  If they can find a bigger space, this place will be the perfect fast food burger alternative.
