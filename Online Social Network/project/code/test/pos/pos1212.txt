When I'm in the area, I usually drop in a for quick "dog" bite... The price is right, and there are many dogs to choose from.

I haven't been bitten by a bad one yet.

I really can't think of anywhere else to go when I'm in the mood for a hot dog (although I do enjoy the ones at Costco---before they took away the kraut...)

Love the kraut and all the other fixins at Top Dog!
