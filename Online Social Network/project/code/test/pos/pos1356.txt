This place delivers food to your table hella fast ~ so if you're starving, you should come here, you'll have food in front of you before you even order. Okay, well, not really. But yeah, it was amazing; made me wonder how they cooked it so fast...

I had salt and pepper chicken, which was pretty americanized and I wouldn't recommend it. Beef chow fun was excellent (I got it cuz others on yelp suggested it) and not too oily, not too salty. Sweet and sour pork was just the standard same ol' same ol'.

DIM SUM: I only had egg custards and xiao long baos, which were okay but considering how much frozen buns cost at Ranch99, I felt majorly ripped off. Egg custards - well, it's kinda hard to mess these up. They were okay.

Overall... the service wasn't that attentive, our table wasn't even set, we were given tea but no cups, had to grab our own cuz there was no waiter to grab the attention of. We ended up ordering directly with the chef who noticed we were just sitting there with menus. I guess the waiter decided it wasn't his job to wait on the tables. Food was pretty good and uber cheap, I'll go here for Chinese food if I'm in the area, otherwise I'm still gonna go to Richmond (Little Hong Kong on San Pablo).

P.S. Even though I didn't feel the food was that salty or heavy tasting or MSG-filled, I was pretty thirsty in the afternoon following this place... hmm...
