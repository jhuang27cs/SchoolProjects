Cheap. Stylish. A good option for students looking to create their own wardrobes.  The $1 a pound pile can be gross but I've turned a lot of my floor finds into sewing projects that become my favorite outfits. Their upstairs is full of beautiful vintage clothing also.  It's just a great place. I only let myself go their once a semester.
