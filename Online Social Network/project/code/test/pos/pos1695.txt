this by far, is my fave max's location. it is always crowded and the food is consistent. plus they have a few extra fancy items at this location. i ate here yesterday for a late lunch and i ordered the sliders and a cup of the russian cabbage soup. the sliders came on a dinner roll and tasted good, although i could've use some cheese with it. the russian cabbage soup wasn't mushy like the one in civic center sf...it was the perfect balance of tangy and sweet; hearty and healthy and just yummy.
