Nothing is better than Diet Coke with Lime.

And one more thing, why are we reviewing Coca Cola?! 

But if I had to comment on the building, its tall - probably about 30 floors. The logo is on top and you can see it from the free way. It's right next to Georgia Tech and therefor lots of Tech kids get jobs there traveling around the world doing international marketing.

It's a great street corner for bums, they just linger around hoping that someone will give them a buck or two. 

But besides that...Coke is classic....I would never think of drinking Pepsi or any of those other cola drinks...yuck!
