I haven't done brunch here yet, but I've heard it's epic. The drinks... are also delicious though. We went in for a post birthday dinner drinks on a Thursday night, and sat at the bar. The place is awesome. The music was awesome. The decor is awesome. The drinks are awesome. Their super extensive cocktail menu has something for everyone, and they're all named amazing things, like Rich & Dirty, or Sweet & Sassy. The bartenders are good at their job. Delicious.
