The turkey pastrami sandwich here is one of my favorites.  My 6 year-old, the world title holder for "pickiest eater," loves the matzo ball soup here (she even eats the carrots in it!).  The salads are delicious and the desserts are a sight to behold!  I don't know why but, we often feel an odd rush of pride when our server gets up to sing at the piano (all of service staff do it at one time or another during the evening), it's like we're thinking, "Yes, that's Mary or Jake, our server!  We go back 20 minutes at least!" (Yes, we are freaks. ) The atmosphere is here is fun, that's for sure.  Not only is the staff vocally talented, they're personable and they'll take good care of you. 

The only beef I have with the place is that the waiting area is so damn tight!  The place is POPULAR so this narrow space where you have to wait for redemption to come in the form of an available table gets very crowded.  Maybe that's part of their shtick, to instill you with gratitude to be there.  Well, it's not necessary because I'm already grateful, grateful for their turkey pastrami!
