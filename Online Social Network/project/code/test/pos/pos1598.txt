my rating is for dr. raz.  he is the top doctor and wonderful to talk to.  his phone staff on the other hand is the worst!  i have been trying to get a urine culture result for 3 days.  the staff takes messages and no one calls me back.  i have left 9 or more messages and finally got a call back from one of the doctors who could not find my fax from the lab.  the lab has sent the results twice.  still waiting it is one week now.  hope to get a answer today...
