I stumbled across this cool sneaker store after grabbing a bite at Top Dog and bought a couple of classic kicks from this new boutique in Berkeley. The store was cozy and inviting and the guys behind the counter were knowlegable about their product and pretty enthusiastic about making me a happy customer. They had shoes that I haven't seen since I was a kid. Great store and I'll definitely be back for more shoes when I throw out some older shoes from my closet.
