ohh Chipotle. your calorific steak burritos have been me and my roomates' worst weakness for months. She's been known to go as far as to pay a friend triple the price to bike to the Ave and bring back a foil-wrapped five-pound piece of heaven. I feel guilty for days after effortlessly gorging myself on the spicy, flavorful, and FILLING meals at Chipotle. I like to switch between the steak burrito and the chicken soft tacos. Go, but don't go often. added bonus, students get a free drink with their meal. With good luck you'll make it in at a time when a frat boy in front of you is not ordering food for his entire house.
