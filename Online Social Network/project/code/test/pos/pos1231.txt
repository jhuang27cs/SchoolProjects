Really solid pho on the ave. So far it is probably the best I have had on this particular pho packed thoroughfare. Not the best ever, but still pretty good. 

I have come to realize pho is one of those things, kind of like pumpkin pie. There is a pretty small range of difference between where you go, and its hard to find a really stand out bowl of pho, or pumpkin pie. It usually comes down to the intangibles. Whether it be the freshness of the garnishes, the friendliness of the wait staff, or the decor. 

The garnishes here are not always the freshest (last time i went the basil looked rather sad), but the wait staff is always very friendly and the shop itself is quaint and a little set back from the bustle of the ave. The few other things I have had on the menu are also solid. 

So on a whole, there ya go. My search for the perfect bowl of pho continues. The Vi does a solid job, but I will journey on.
