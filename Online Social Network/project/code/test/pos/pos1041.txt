This place is right by my church and I've always walked by it, but never stopped to eat here. Ate here for lunch today and I enjoyed it! They have outdoor seating so it's real nice when the weather's nice.

The staff is super friendly. The owner (I think that's who he was) walks around and makes sure everything is all good and the other staff members are nice as well. 

The food is pretty good! I got the potato gnocchi, YUM. I also enjoy when entrees come with a soup or salad, which this place did. 

Only thing is.. we didn't have utensils for the longest time and our server didn't notice even when she brought us our salads. Brought our salads and then left. We had to flag somebody else down to get them.

I would come here again (:
