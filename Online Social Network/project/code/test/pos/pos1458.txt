I just have two questions.....where have you been all our life and why has no one told us about this place before now?  

Hubby and I have been there twice now and both times had our socks literally knocked off by the food!  I am now dreaming of the fried calamari.  

Both times we started with the fried calamari, which is WAY too much for two people to finish.  It's more like an appetizer for four.  The cocktail sauce is fantastic too - I'm not usually a fan of cocktail sauce.  Salads are fresh and the homemade dressings are delicious.

For dinners we have tried the Veal Giuseppe, Veal Scorcese, Shrimp Michael and the Chicken Parm.  Hubby advised against ordering the chicken parm as it is a standard everywhere, but I went against his suggestion and got it anyway.  Even HE was surprised at how good it was!  Best chicken parm I've ever had and the portions are HUGE!  I would be happy with just a bowl of pasta and their red sauce.  The pasta is obviously not the cheap stuff served everywhere else.  It's SO good.  Hubby says it reminds him of when he was a child and his grandmother cooked all day (and THAT is quite a compliment).

It's a little pricey, probably best saved for special occasions or when you want a REALLY good meal but it's definitely worth the price.  We can't wait to go back!
