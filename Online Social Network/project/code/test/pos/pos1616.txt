AWESOME people here.  I went in for a quote, three different people at the shop looked at my design, gave me their opinion on the size (I was thinking of getting it smaller than the design I brought in, they dissuaded me because the ink would bleed together and the lines become unclean and indistinct over time).  They were honest, straightforward, friendly and never talked down to me (even though I had no visible ink and other places had condescended to me because I'm a "newb").
A little over a week later, I went in and Emily gave me my very first tat, on the back of my neck.  I had a bad reaction each time she went over this particular spot (gave me the shakes and just made me feel damn weird, pressure point or something!)  She was patient and extremely easygoing about it ("This stuff happens sometimes!"), brought me water and even had someone go next door to get me a sucker just in case.  It's been a few days now; the ink is very deep, healing up nice and looks awesome.  No problems with it so far.

Liberty is very clean, the people are genuinely nice, and their prices are reasonable.  I will definitely be back.  Thank you!
