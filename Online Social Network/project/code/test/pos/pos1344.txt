This place cannot be beat. Cheap beer, great pitchers, giant subs, big tvs.... What more can you want? Uhh....if I had to say anything, parking? But it's westwood so you can't expect that from anywhere. Either way this place is definitely a hidden gem. I've been coming to Westwood village since high school 7 years ago and I never even knew this place was here. It's a secret so don't tell all your friends, but definitely try it out. It's like an alcoholic subway with big screen tvs everywhere. What's not to love?
