I've only stopped by here once so far, but I'm a fan! I love the space, bright and airy - somewhat like an art gallery like another reviewer noted. 

They have an interesting array of "gourmet latte" drinks with combinations like earl grey infused or cardamom rose water. I tried a relatively tame latte with vanilla and burnt sugar. It was good and I'm definitely interested in trying some of their other creations. I've also heard that their drip coffee is good.
