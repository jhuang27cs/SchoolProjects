The Rose is a restaurant/bar. They serve food as well as drinks. They have many tvs in the bar area to view sports games. They have recently expanded to add more seating. This is an a ok place, the drinks are good and the food is pretty good too. I only go there once in a while. The service is good and the staff is friendly.
