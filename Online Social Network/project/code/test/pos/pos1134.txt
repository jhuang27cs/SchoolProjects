I'm not too much into science and technology but was very entertained by the exhibits. I especially like the moving Holograms and the Gestural Engineering section. I was hoping that MIT would infuse me with some extra smartness by just being in its presence, but alas no. It takes less than an hour to peruse the museum. Definitely a must see while in Boston/Cambridge.

We geeked out and bought too much in the gift shop!
