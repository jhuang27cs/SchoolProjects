Vimala and her husband (and some of her children) have created an eating experience.  The outdoor area is perfect, as is the eating experience inside - where you can view the kitchen!!!
Having traveled all throughout India, I can attest to the AAA quality of the food offered and the soul/spirit infused by Vimala!  You must try this eating experience.  And be sure to say hello to Vimala while you're there.
