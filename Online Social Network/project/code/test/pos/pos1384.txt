I spent my St. Patty's Day here yesterday with friends, and had a most awesome time! We had many many Guinnesses and great food.

I love the fact that the waitress was Irish. She was incredibly nice and very attentive to our large group.

The food here was superb. I had the yummiest fish & chips I've had anywhere. The corned beef and cabbage & shepherd's pie also looked really good.

They played good Irish music all day, which got louder as the place got more crowded. The only thing that made this place a less than perfect was that there wasn't live music.
