This is my first yelp review. It was really good food and an unpretensious atmosphere. We had ten people for dinner and brought our own wine. $50 well spent for my wife and I.

Tip_ we made a reservation the day before and it was a 3 hour meal. Don't be in a hurry and try this place with someone you want to talk and laugh with.
