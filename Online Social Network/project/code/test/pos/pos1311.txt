This cafe was a very pleasant surprise for breakfast. Every item I tried was surprisingly good.

The organic coffee came in a huge mug, bigger than most soup cups and had a really nice smooth and only slightly bitter taste. If you enjoy Intelligensia I'm sure you'd enjoy this one as well. The Italian soda was pretty normal, using Da Vinci syrup.

Both the roast beef wrap and mango chicken wrap were fresh and light with a good mix of flavors. The cream cheese is from local sources which you can clearly taste from the first bite. The sides of salad and fruit were both fresh and flavorful.

I will definitely return here on my next trip downstate.
