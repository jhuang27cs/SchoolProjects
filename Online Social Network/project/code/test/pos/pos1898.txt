while running around taking care of errands today i decided to try this place out for the 1st time. i got the egg salad sammich on olive bread. it came out looking delicious & rustic. love the flavor. easy to make at home but was happy to find an egg sandwich that wasn't overly dressed. 

i also tried berry tea. no good. way tart & weird. i normally don't put anything in my teas at all i had to put a little sugar. then it just tasted off, so i tossed the thing. it's too bad because the idea of "berry tea" sounds delicious. 

for the road, i picked up some macarons. being a fan of la duree i figured i'd try for the heck of it. even tho they look monsterous. picked up the raspberry, mixed berry, hazelnut & pistachio. both of the berries seems eh, not very impressive. personally i like fruit jam/compote of some sort for filling if it's a fruit based macaroon. the pistachio seemed the most decent & i didn't gt a chance to try the hazelnut being that someone else ate it. 

overall i'd go back for a sandwich if i was in the area again.
