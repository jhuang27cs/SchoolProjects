I used to sometimes eat here twice a day. When you see the truck, you will notice that there is an orange sign with an additional menu on it. Those are the dishes that can be prepared quickly. People are not served in the order in which they order, but instead in the order in which the food is finished, so if you order a fast dish, you can be served faster! Also, they are on Shopik (an iPhone app), so you can get a free soda with their coupon between 3 and  5 p.m. My favorites include mapo tofu, kung pao chicken, garlic chicken, and black bean chicken. Yum!
