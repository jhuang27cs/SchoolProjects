I have visited many comic book shops over the years but Vault of Midnight takes the cake.  They have a large selection of graphic novels, comics, figurines and cute toys.  I bought a model Enterprise here.  Even the stairwell is packed with goodies.

If you have any questions the staff is very friendly and REALLY know their stuff. Being a block away from where I work, I have to try hard to avoid this place come payday or I'd blow it all in here.
