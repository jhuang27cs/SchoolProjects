i'm personally not a huge hot dog fan so going to a place called "wonderdogs" would usually not end well.  however, this place has great burgers too - the ingredients are fresh and the prices are very reasonable.  to top it off, the owner is a nice guy.  i once accidentally showed up without my wallet and he was willing to take an IOU.  now that's good service :)
