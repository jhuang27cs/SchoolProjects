This was a great hotel at a great price! I didn't get to explore the neighborhood too much, but I hear it's a nice area in the University District. 
i booked the room on Hotwire (3.5 star in U district) and got a GREAT deal, but even for the price that was listed on the website ($161) I would've been happy. 
The hotel is a renovated old hotel, so some parts of it had the old "charm", the rooms were a bit small, but it didn't smell like an old hotel and the bedding was nice. And for bonus points, the alarm clock radio had an IPOD-DOCK. Brilliant!
