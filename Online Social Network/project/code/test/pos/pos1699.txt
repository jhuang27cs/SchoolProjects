I was excited to meet up with my very good friends, Joel and Cliff; to check out their new puppy, Harry!  Harry is super adorable and is half boxer and half terrier.  Just looking at him, made me want another puppy!  Since Harry needed a little nap, we decided to head out to dinner.  Cliff was craving burgers so we went to the Vortex!

The place was pretty packed for a Wed night!  It's been awhile since I have been here and noticed a lot of new additions to the menu.  We started off with the Onion Rings, which were really good.  I got the usual Blue Shroom Burger (Blue Cheese, Bacon and Mushrooms), Cliff got the Black and Blue Turkey Burger and Joel stuck with the Original Cheddar Burger.  Of course all of us got TOTS...I mean who doesn't like tots!?

Overall food and service was very good and still consistent!  Next time I'll have to get the courage to order the Elvis Burger....Burger with Peanut Butter, Bacon and Bananas!  I know...sounds a bit weird and almost too gross, but heck...its a lot of my favorite things in one bun!
