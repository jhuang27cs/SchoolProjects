Dang ol' Clay Pit.  Extremely erratic buffet action.   The buffet is cheap, no doubt.  Sometimes I like all 4 main dishes they have; other times I have to eat salad, naan, and mango dessert because it is 0 for 4 on the main food items.  They need to mix up the rotation OR add another main item / somosas as insurance.  

For dinner, though, they rock.  I have never had a bad dish, just occasional snoot from the staff if no reservations.  Best Indian food in Austin, after 4pm.
