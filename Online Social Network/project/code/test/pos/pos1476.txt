Pros: The food is pretty good and is fair priced. You get tons of fries when you order it in a meal and its all cooked right there in front of you so its fairly fresh. They also have a wider selection of burgers than your average restaurant. Very nice service as well

Cons: The cost of the meal is a bit outrageous compared to the normal meal. The meal is almost double the burger. Prices are kind of confusing as well.
