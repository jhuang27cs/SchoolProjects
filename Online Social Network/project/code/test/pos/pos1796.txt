#20. This place never gets old.  The sample cups, the awesome flavors, the multitude of toppings-- now I just wanna go on a yogurt run!  If you have a 5C ID, bring it for a discount!  That's what makes this branch better than the others for me.

Beware of the crowds.  It can get really dense here at the most random times of the day.  Then there are other times when this place looks like a ghost town.
