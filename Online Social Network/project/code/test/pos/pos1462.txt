I used to miss my favorite Korean BBQ Seoul Brothers fast food establishment (they closed recently) and now thanks to Cham I am not going to miss them!!!! 

I visited this establishment on their first day. I ordered the short ribs, with the watermelon appetizer. I had this dish where you make "tacos" with sesame seed leaves. The food was fresh and tasty and seemed to be healthy. The portions are a good size so that you do not leave overstuffed. I had the mint lemonade which kind of reminded me of a mojito without the rum. 

I can't possibly tell you how impressed I am with the food and service. The employees/owner(s) were extremely helpful, and the service was unmatched by any other "fast food". Next time I am going to check out the steamed buns and you all will know what is up with that.
