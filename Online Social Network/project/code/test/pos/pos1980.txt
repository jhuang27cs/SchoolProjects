i luh-huve it.

well, not as much as pinkberry...

...but since we don't have those up here (yet!! ...i'm keeping my fingers crossed.) this will have to be my #1.

after working in retail for over 10 years, i've turned into some what of an online shopping hermit. but whenever i hit up southcenter or pacific place, i get a cup. 

my favorite is an original with raspberries, mochi, and dark chocolate chips. YUMMM. i recently tried solely blackberries... it was good, too, because they were ripe and delicious, but didn't have as much of the taste variety as my favorite 3-punch combo.

yeah, yeah, it's a little pricey, but i figure it's worth it---- it tastes good and doesn't make me feel like a bloated piece of crap. 

the only negative is the kids behind the counter. ummm hello, do they pay you to bitchy?? however, i will trudge along and not be deterred!!
