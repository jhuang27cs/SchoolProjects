In the Palo Alto cupcakery battle royale, Kara's: 1, Sprinkles: 0. The little slice of heaven that is the carrot cake cupcake totally rocked my world in the doldrums of a Thursday afternoon. The cake was so wonderfully moist, and the frosting was quite smooth and flavorful! On my next Kara's jaunt, I'll be back for the Fleur de Sel.
