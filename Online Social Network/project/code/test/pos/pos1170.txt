We came here for the first time last week with my aunt. she got the beef noodle bowl and rated it 'ok'. My husband and i got the Tom Yum Hot Pot for two - it comes with an open flame and a tray of veggies and raw meat that you cook in the broth yourself! it was pretty fun, and tasty too. service was good, staff polite and attentive. pleasant casual ambience, nice atmosphere.
