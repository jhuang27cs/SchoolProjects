When I hear "Westwood", I think of:

UCLA
crappy parking
Diddy Riese!!

I came here at 11:30PM on a Tuesday night with my burger buddy Tim C. and still had to wait in line for the last baked cookies of the evening. With a scoop of mint chip ice cream sandwiched between a peanut butter and chocolate-chocolate chip cookie, this $1.50 steal was worth every calorie.

Of course I couldn't leave without buying some cookies for friends and family. With white chocolate macadamia nut and chocolate chip with nuts, a dozen would set you back only $3.75! My friend thoroughly enjoyed it saying it was almost good as their mom's recipe.

Don't be turned off when you see the huge grease stain from the white bag the next morning! So good and definitely a Westwood landmark!
