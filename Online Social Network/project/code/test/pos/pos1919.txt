Great burgers, with a great retro look.  You can tell this place has been around a long time.

The menu changes a bit over time (and between locations) but the burgers are as follows:  the hamburger/cheeseburger, the Double Take (two meat, two cheese), the Triple Take, the Take-Four, and the Take-Five (five meat, five cheese ... for the truly hungry!)

The fries are great (unlike In-N-Out), and so are the shakes: vanilla, chocolate, or boysenberry.  (And maybe strawberry, but I'm not sure.)

Sure, they are a bit of a rip off of In-N-Out.  But the wait is shorter here (the local In-N-Out is ridiculously busy at lunch) and in my opinion the food is much better at EZ Take Out (or "EZ Burger" as most of my friends call it).  And where else can you get boysenberry shakes?

Take the EZ Burger Challenge:   Eat a Take-5, fries, and a large boysenberry shake.  (I did so once, after being challenged by a friend in college.) That's a heck of a meal ... until your heart  explodes.


There's another EZ Take Out at the corner of Mountain and Arrow, which tends to be open later.  But I prefer the food here, at the Foothill & Central location.
