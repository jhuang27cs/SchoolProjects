This is by far some of the best tasting curry I have ever had, though my experiences are limited to a few restaurants back in AZ and the few I've tried here in the bay area. By my foodie standards, though, the price is cheap ($6) for the curry, but you have to pay extra for the rice or naan. Still, $6 for a tub of curry to go it pretty cheap if you can make your rice at home.

The only thing is that I ordered paneer and chicken tikka masala on two different occassions and both time there wasn't enough cheese or chicken. I wish they included a little more substantial food and a little less sauce, but you can always add your own meat! Haha, really what makes the tikka masla is the sauce and the lack of a large amount of spiciness for me, so this is perfect!

Oh and one time I ate there with some friends and just nibbled on some of their stuff, but the wait was really long. Somewhere around an hour and a half...and it wasn't even that busy when we got there. It was busier when we left, and I noticed some people who ordered after us got their food first. They should work on that.

But free chai tea while you wait! :)
