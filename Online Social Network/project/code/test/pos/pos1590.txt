I came here with a Gilt City voucher (Cheese Indulgence for two) for a late V-day dinner. The website boasted of this place being "most romantic restaurant in Boston" so I was eager to check out this place. 
It is a very small restaurant, like other reviewers said, but I had a 6:15 reservation and we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival. I think it was less crowded because we opted to go on a Sunday. 
I found the tables are a little close for my liking but I guess that is understandable for such a small venue.
We had the ham and mushroom raclette(spelling?), which I enjoyed. Sometimes I find cheese fondue a little too cheesy and the raclette was much better. For the entree, we opted for the red wine/mushroom broth instead of the regular one, and I liked eating the mushrooms that were bobbing around in the pot. Our entree meats came plated prettily on one plate for each person (so it's not just all the meats/seafood on one plate, like at a buffet) which I thought was a nice touch.
I can't remember which dessert fondue we got but how can you say anything bad about melted chocolate? Needless to say, it was delicious and I liked that there was a lot of fruit to dip into the fondue. 

The only other fondue place I've tried is The Melting Pot in California and I liked this place better. I think the broth tasted better here but the location I went to in California definitely had more intimate seating with tall booths spaced relatively far apart.
