Wow, did my S.O. and I luck out with a great deal on this hotel. We used Hotels.com to book it, and we got a great price. The location was excellent -- we had our choice of Starbucks in the morning, it was easy to find, really close to UCSD's campus, and centrally located between major highways. The bonus is that we got to see the fairy-tale-completely-out-of-place Mormon temple every time we got off the highway when returning to the hotel.

The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the housekeeping service was top notch.

I definitely felt fancy staying here.

We went to the bar inside once. I wish it were a little more crowded, but it was a nice way to have a little nightcap after dinner out.

A minor complaint: For all you ladies who like to be able to see your face while putting on your makeup, it was a bit dark in the bathroom, even with all of the lights on. I'd recommend bringing a travel lighted mirror to use so that you don't have to guess where your eyes are. Also, the curve of the sink made it so that the mirror was further away from me than necessary. As someone who wears glasses for distance, it was a little difficult to see while drying my hair since I had to stand so far away from the mirror.

Tip: Save your hard-earned cash by finding a parking spot on the street outside the hotel, rather than using their $18 dollar parking lot. It really wasn't that inconvenient.

Next time in San Diego, I'd definitely choose to stay here again, especially if we get the same sort of deal.
