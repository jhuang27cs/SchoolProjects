Scouring Shattuck, one weeknight, 
It seemed as there were none in sight.
Though it was shit, and now I'm far,
Sometimes I think of UCR.
Where bubble tea, I oft enjoyed,
'Cause I was rich, and unemployed.
Bubble tea across from bubble tea,
All open late, just right for me.
Now Berkeley, though I love you so,
There's no late night place I can go,
To satisfy this need? I can't!
Until I wandered up Durant.
There surely was a magic town,
For there, my boba, I had found. 
Small shopping alley, tucked away,
I came upon this sweetheart cafe.
Inside was simple, small, and cheery,
Although the staff seemed kind of weary.
I understand, 'cause it was late, 
With tea in hand, I could not hate.
The price? Not bad, the tea, real good,
I made it last, long as I could. 
As each pearl burst, inside my mouth,
I thought about my days down south.
I thought, "Why do I miss them so?"
But this shit's better, so let's go.
