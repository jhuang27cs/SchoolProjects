Since the one in Santana Row is not open yet, I went to the one in Palo Alto this morning to try cupcakes from this much-talked-about store.  The Palo Alto store has been open for six weeks and the Santana Row one is slated to open in mid Nov, according to the very informative and friendly store manager, Shauna.

I asked Shauna for recommendations and she said the most popular flavors are Chocolate Velvet and Vanilla.  Beyond that, it's up to individual's taste.  Since I am partial for dark chocolate, I ordered Fleur De Sel in addition to Chocolate Velvet and Vanilla.  

The chocolate velvet is very smooth, the frosting fluffy but not too sweet.  The Flour De Sel is equally good, although I am not too crazy about the small amout of salt on top.  I haven't tried the Vanilla one yet.

High-quality cupcakes, and I will be back again.  I knocked one star off, as the size is a bit on the small side, especially considering its price tag of $3.25/each.  Other than that, it's certainly a good cupcake.
