It's a mix of locals and college students, even some military guys. It's nearly impossible to get seated after like 9pm (usually at least an hour wait) , or at least that's the only time I go and it's always packed. And really loud, so you're always yelling. Sometimes it gets rowdy but the bouncers are actually amazingly responsive and diffuse the situations well.. thanks, confrontational boyfriend.

The food is okay, really big portions though. I was just shocked when they gave me my burrito.

They're open only to 21+ after like 3-4pm, and they card really hard so unless you are legitimately 21+ or have an awesome fake, don't even try, it'll just be embarrassing for you and your friends.

But really none of that matters because just one of their amazing BIG AZZ margaritas are enough to get me happily buzzed, and it's just $7 every night 10-midnight (and during happy hour 430-630 weekdays, it's also $7 for the big azz, $5 for the 16oz, and $3 for the 12oz.). There's fresh fruit in them -- where else can you get that for $7?! If you find a better deal, let me know. I always get the mango, but the strawberry & raspberry are good too. And you can be adventurous and try the seasonal but they always sound kinda weird to me...
