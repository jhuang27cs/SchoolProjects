9 words:  Vanilla soft serve on a cone with multi-colored sprinkles!

Ahhhhhhhhhhh.  Carvel.  The town I grew up in had three.  This is where my parents would take me after a little league game.  This is where my mother took us when she craved a Brown Bonnet.  This is where Wednesday was Sundae!  This is where Cookie Puss & Fudgie the Whale are from.  This is where my birthday cake had to come from when I was a child.  If you grew up in the East you may know what I am talking about.  You may even remember the commercials with Tom Carvel's horrific gravelly voice announcing, "I'm Tom Carvel . . ."  If not, I'll fill you in.  

Carvel is ice cream plain and simple.  Nothing fancy here.  But, its good.  Especially, the soft serve which is the specialty.  I don't think I have ever even had their hard ice cream.  

One day at work last year I had a sudden craving for Carvel.  But, alas, there were none in the Bay Area and no one at work had any idea what I was talking about.  A few months later my craving came back.  By then, a Jersey Girl was working in my office.  So, at least, she understood me.  We went on line and saw that one was coming to Berkeley.  Every few weeks, I would check to see if they opened.  When they finally did last fall, I schlepped my Iowan boyfriend over the Bay Bridge for his first Carvel cone.  It was heavenly.  Instantly, I was six years old trying to not let the cone drip and to not get the ice cream all over myself.  Damn, was that good!
