Spent a Thursday afternoon enjoying GREAT bar food and a very good selection of beers.  I know they don't serve peanut butter on their hamburgers (Triple XXX up the street) but the fried pickles and mini-burgers certainly can hold their own.  The breaded pork cutlet sandwich is a huge meal and delicious.  Plenty of big screen TVs with all the sports you can take in.  School was out when we were there and the place seemed to miss the students but all and all good place to unwind for the road warriors.
