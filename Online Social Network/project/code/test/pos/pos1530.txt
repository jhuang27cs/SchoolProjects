I'm a creature of habit.  Being a UCLA undergrad, I spent a lot of time in Westwood, and I tended to eat at the same restaurants again and again and again.  This was one of them.  I also usually ate the same thing every time = the halibut fish tacos.  (They are AMAZING by the way).  Eventually, I realized that I should try other things as well.  

I tried the pizza.  Delicious.

I tried the avocado egg rolls.  One of the best appetizers I've ever had.

I tried their beers.  Great.

I'm a pescetarian (the only meat I eat is seafood), so I cannot vouch for any of the meat dishes, but my boyfriend loves the chicken fettuccine Alfredo, and a lot of my friends love the BBQ chicken pizza and the Cobb salad.

Anyway, I've liked every single thing I've tried, and I don't think I've ever met anyone who has been disappointed.

And, let's be honest...with a name like "BJ's," it's gotta be good!
