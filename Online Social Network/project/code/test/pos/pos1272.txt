Although the flavors tend to be sweeter and less pungent than restaurants catering to Asians, the food here is still flavorful.  The lunch specials include fake meat and brown rice at no extra charge. I had the mussaman curry-- it was very filling. The dish called Param was too sweet.  Good sized portions were served promptly.
