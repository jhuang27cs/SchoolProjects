I'm not the biggest ice cream fan. I do love it but i never go out of my way to get it. When i moved to central square it took me a while to make my way to toscanini's. I saw some magazine article up on the wall that they had the best strawberry ice cream in the country or something so i decided to order it. (when in rome...)

It literally was the best strawberry ice cream i've had in my life. I dont know how any of the other flavors were but the strawberry was ridiculous. I'd definitely go back for more.
