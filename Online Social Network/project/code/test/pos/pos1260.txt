This review is long over due. We had our wedding here on  10-10-10 and it was fantastic. 
John, Mr. Fabulous is very helpful, super nice and well...fabulous. We had our ceremony at their beautiful waterfall courtyard and our reception in the ballroom just adjacent to that. We had a great time. The staff is very accommodating and nice. 
We had our own room to change in for both the parties before the wedding and received a newlywed suite for the night. Thanks to JOHN!!! Our guest were fully accommodated with great pricing to stay the weekend (one of the most popular weekends). No one had a problem booking a room. Thanks Krystle!!!
The food was pretty good, considering and I had 2 taste tests!!! but not excellent so that's why i gave it a 4. they fully accommodated us, especially all the bride's request (very important). the cake that comes with the wedding package is so delicious. mmmmmm. we didn't even save the top tier, we ate it all!!
I would highly recommend this place for a wedding or party. the price is very reasonable and the staff is great! 
Plus who can beat having warm chocolate chip cookies 24/7???!! yummy!!!
