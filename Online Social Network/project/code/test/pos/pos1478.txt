Came here with a party of 8 without a reservation on a Saturday night = major mistake. This was was completely packed by the time we arrived there. I think we tried to make reservations earlier during the day, but all of the reservations were filled as well. 

I think the place is quite overrated. Let's just say my experience went from a 5 down to 4 upon arrival of the food and 3.5 when the bill came. 

The ambience and the atmosphere of the restaurant was definitely 5 stars. Walking into the restaurant, I can smell the aroma of good food. We got seated in the outdoor patio area, which was kind of nice, for some fresh air, light breeze (though it got quite cold later), and nice jazzy music. Our waiter was extremely nice, with a sense of humor. Instead of offering just regular water, they had sparking water as well. 

The menu was quite different from what I saw on the website. They had the evening special, which was the Halibut fish. But since it costs around $28, I figured it wouldn't be worth it. Instead, I shared a Duck sausage pizza, pork pizza, and burger with 2 others. The food took around 30 minutes to arrive. The duck sausage was quite interesting because they had a pouched egg in the center, which tasted quite good actually. However, I didn't quite like the crust because it was hard and some parts were burnt. The burger was delicious but tiny, the size of a small fist. I enjoyed the complementary thin crisp fries. Instead serving with ketchup, they had some organic kind of bbq sauce, which tasted pretty unique. 

Overall, the experience was unique and food was quite good, but paying $16 for 2 small slices of pizza and a third of a small burger was  not so worthwhile.
