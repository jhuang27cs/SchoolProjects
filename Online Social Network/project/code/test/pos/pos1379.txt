This is, by far, the best Vegan restaurant in Seattle. As a bonus, it has a really nice atmosphere, and is a great place to take your parents or out of town guests, or for big groups. I've always had the friendliest wait staff as well.

The have a very affordable lunch buffet, and as a side bonus, they've been known to let local broke folk come in at the end of the lunch buffet and help clean up in return for as much food as they can carry away, which makes me feel all morally warm and fuzzy.

It's also now the favorite place for our company to order food when we are entertaining clients, and all sorts of folk have fallen in love with it. I've also heard, but cannot confirm, that it is the only all vegan Thai resturant in the country?? Anyone know about that?

Plus, where else in the world could you find avacado curry with about 4 different types of fake meat???

The last few Saturday night's I've been their, they've also had some very mellow live music, and it looks like they are trying to expand the back of the restaurant into a lounge.
