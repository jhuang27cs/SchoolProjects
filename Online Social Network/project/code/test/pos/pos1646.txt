I'm assuming this place is almost new based on the fact that it wasn't in my GPS or in Yelp's business database.  Oh well, it is now.  :)  This hotel is certainly above average.  The bed feels like sleeping on a cloud.  The fitness center is large and all of the equipment is in great shape.  There is more than ample parking.  The room is quite spacious and the whole place has a rather inviting feel.  The walls seem to keep out noise a bit better than most.  The only real downside I can see is that there's not much of anything within walking distance of this place.  (Granted, If you're in Blacksburg you've probably driven to get here anyway).  Also, there was a bizarre white film over the outside of my window.  Oh well.  It was still a very comfortable stay and I'll be back.
