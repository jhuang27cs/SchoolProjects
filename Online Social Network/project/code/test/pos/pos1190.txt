I pretty much love the Middle East as a concert venue, especially downstairs. Yes, it's hot and you'll definitely be covered in sweat by the end of the show (if you're doing it right). Yes, you're in the basement with pipes over your head. Yes, the bathroom isn't lovely, (but it's not that bad either, you babies!). And yes, it gets really crowded and you have no choice but to get up close and personal with your fellow concert-goers. But when you're dancing to sweet, inexpensive, live music, having a few drinks (the beer prices are totally average), and enjoying a night out with your friends, who the hell cares?

Here's a lesson I learned the hard way: bring ear plugs! (I know, now who's the baby?) But for real. Who cares if it doesn't look cool? It's better than leaving the Middle East with a pounding headache, muffled hearing, and a ringing in your ears that's more annoying than a skipping Aphex Twin record. Be smart now, or your future self is gonna be pissed. And deaf. That's the double truth.
