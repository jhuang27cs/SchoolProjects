Finally...actual Mexican food.  

I love that they separate the  menu into 'traditional' and 'tex-mex'  so people know that there is a difference. 

I've had several different items from the menu, but the huarache is by far my favorite.  As far as meat, I've only ever had the chicken tinga, but it's clearly good enough that I don't get anything else.
