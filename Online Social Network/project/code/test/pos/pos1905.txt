Lots o' good, a dash of snobbery. 

Both cocktail and food (main dining and bar) menus are good. I had pork 2 ways as my entree, and it was absolutely 5 starts delish. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and drink both times I dined there. 

Craigie loses one star (well, 1/2 for stupid name, so I guess half a star) for thinking it's God's gift to restaurants. Unaccommodating hostesses who seat my party in the bar area without warning=bad. Demanding a credit card for my small party on the weekend and my larger party during the week=bitch please! Once I've dined at your place and dropped several hundred dollars don't make me give you my credit card to hold my reservation like I'm some train-jumpin' hobo who may or may not show up. Get over yourself, you're a bistro, not heaven.
