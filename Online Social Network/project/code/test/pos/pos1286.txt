Had an early Valentine lunch at their restaurant (the Garden Room) today. The food were all using fresh ingredients, nicely prepared and presented.  We had the soups (Potato Leek Chowder and Wild Mushroom), Pulled Pork Sandwich, and Grilled Chicken Breast Panini. The chowder was creamy and the mushroom had a strong taste. The barbecued pork went very well with the crispy onions and the blue cabbage. Same for the a little bland chicken with the melted cheese and tomato sauce. We finished off a satisfying meal with the chocolate bread pudding and a strong coffee.

The creamy table cloth and napkins and the from ceiling to floor windows looking out to the Princeton campus justified the last star to push it to a five.
