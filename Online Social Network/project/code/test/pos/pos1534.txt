Pagliacci's is GREAT pizza. This location has excellent pizza-by-the-slice and the staff is very friendly, cordial, efficient and helpful.  The interior is like a haven from the usual unfriendly and too-cool-for-school attitude and  dreck of the U District.

I have never been a giant fan of their crust but slice-for-slice, they are one of the best pizza places in Seattle, if not the United States.

(And can someone please tell me how to pronounce this place? I get PAG-liacci, I get PAH-lacci, both from employees and patrons. It's a classic Seattle mess).
