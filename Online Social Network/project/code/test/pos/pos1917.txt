A humble and comfty eatery. Prices and portions are reasonable. 

I love the $6.99 Corner Combo (half sandwich or panini, half salad/soup combination). 

For some California-grown grubbin', try the California Grille:
Marinated artichoke hearts, roasted plum tomatoes, fresh spinach, pesto and provolone cheese grilled to perfection on whole grain harvest bread...mmm...

Chicken Pomodori
A guaranteed winner. Sliced chicken breast, fresh basil and spinach, oven roasted tomatoes, and provolone cheese with pesto mayonnaise on grilled sourdough country bread. 

For pesto and pasta lovers like myself, I recommend the Pesto Cavatappi:
Oven roasted chicken and steaming cavatappi pasta tossed in a rich pesto cream sauce sprinkled with toasted breadcrumbs.
