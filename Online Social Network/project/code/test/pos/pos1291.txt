I had a first pregnancy appointment with another OB in Dr. Crumb's group, but through no fault of her own, the other doctor had to cancel last minute.  I have been feeling really sick and Dr. Crumb immediately worked me into his schedule right away.  I was very impressed by my experience with Dr. Crumb.  He was a great listener, patient and thorough.  I still have my regular appointment set of the other OB tomorrow, but would go back to Dr. Crumb in a heart beat.
