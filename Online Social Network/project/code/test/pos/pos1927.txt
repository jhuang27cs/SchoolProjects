I have been an avid reader of the Loaf for many years.  I have always enjoyed the great list for every venue of bands coming in the near future.  Sometimes I don't hear about a show from friends and this is the place I go to so I can make sure I don't miss someone great traipsing through town!

I also loved to read the Blotter to my employees during our lunch break.  We would all sit around and snort into our sandwiches from the wacky things some Atlantans do. 

Some of the articles are great and informative, letting us know what good and bad stuff is happening around our fair town.  What I really love, though, is seeing friends on the cover and squealing for glee up at Buddy's, yelling, "This is my friend!  Wahoo!"  The article on Kenny Crucial just killed me.  Only a paper with their finger on the pulse of Atlanta would know who he is, and write about him!
