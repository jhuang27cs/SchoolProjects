LOVE it!

I just read a review below saying that they raised their prices and it is no longer worth the cost....ummm....it's now like 7 or 8 dollars for a HUGE salad that could feed a family of FOUR! Are you really complaining? The salads are bigger than my head, and your head, put together!

I don't eat here, I always get it to-go because it can be loud, hard to find a table, not very clean. However, if you come during "off" hours, like at night, the place is practically empty! I am not coming to Intermezzo for their atmosphere though, I am coming for their salads!

Besides the huge size of their salads (and I am serious, you need to consider sharing!) the service is fantastic. I have always had really nice people who make my salad, and cashiers as well. Dr. Andrew hates egg. Every time he asks for no egg, they offer to put in extra avocado to make up for it. Now that is great service! They really want you to get your money's worth! And I've seen his chef salad with bacon, when you order meat they don't give you a little, they give you a lot. They are not skimpy on their toppings.

The sandwiches here are pretty damn good too, but it's not what keeps me coming back.

We will continue to come here and get our salads to-go as they continue to fill my to-go box literally to the brim and give me an amazing deal!
