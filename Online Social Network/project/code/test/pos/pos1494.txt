I don't care about this chain, or the menu for the most part, but the bacon, egg, and cheeses on their bread makes my morning everytime.  Bread is always good, the cheese actually has some flavor, and the eggs are cooked well. The better choice for the breakfast sandwich.  I'd choose them over, McDonald's Dunkin Donuts, or Burger King breakfast anyday.
