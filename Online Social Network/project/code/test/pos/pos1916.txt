After reading some reallly terrible yelp reviews of this place I was a bit hesitant, but since I had heard from a fellow student that the pizza was amazing I stopped in for lunch anyways. For $9 you can get 2 splices of pizza, a salad, and a soda. Not the cheapest but certainly worth it if the food is good.  Apparently they precook there pizza slices 50%, and then cook the rest when you order it. I had a slice of cheese (always ALWAYS order a slice of cheese from a NYC pizza joint, if there cheese isnt good then none of there pizzas are) and a slice of their "Bianco," a spinach and ricotta pizza.   Both slices were excellent. I love a good thin crust and this crust delivered. Hot, crispy, crunchy, and the pairing of one slice cheese once slice tomato-less bianco worked out well. Although this location isn't new I think it still has some consistently issues to work out.  Also, when not ordering by the slice, pizza prices can be quite expensive and confusing (there are 4 sizes, and "Large" is the second smallest!) but the staff was helpful enough to explain everything to me.
