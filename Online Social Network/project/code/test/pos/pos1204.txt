This is a top notch little coffeeshop. It's on the other side of the building that holds Au Bon Pain and the Cambridge Trust. They are new, and still working out the kinks but their coffee is kick-ass, they have great egg sandwiches and popovers, and the vegan BLT sandwich for lunch is delicious. That is all that I have tried so far. It is odd that they have both vegan food and nonvegan but seems like a smart idea. They have a lot of space and aesthetically it is pretty boring (lots of cement, modern, minimalist) but this makes it kind of ideal as a place to stay a long time and work on your laptop without distractions. My only complaint is that they are often not ready to serve lunch at 11 am, which is the time they officially switch from breakfast to lunch and the time that I am usually there wanting lunch.
