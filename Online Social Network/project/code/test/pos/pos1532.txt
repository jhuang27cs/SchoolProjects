I have taken my dog to the show and relax on the blanket. Also, I went with friends who drove about an hour away to come see The Marx Brothers on film. I have also attended with with the whole family for Ballet Folkloric and even had the opportunity to dance on the stage. My fiance and I saw a concert one night and we were able to sit in the 3rd row. Tips for concerts - try to make sure you eat before you arrive unless you don't mind waiting in line. Stop at the ticket counter early around 11 am but probably earlier for good shows. Get there early for the show, you can always park and walk around.
