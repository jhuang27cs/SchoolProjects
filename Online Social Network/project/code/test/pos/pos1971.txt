A gem of a small aquarium!  Spent a few hours there on a summer Wednesday afternoon and loved it.  There was no crowd so it was easy to see each tank up close and fully enjoy the displays.  The seahorse and jellyfish exhibits are excellent.The kelp tank isn't as large as those found at Long Beach or Monterey, but it was a great display with an interesting variety of sea life.  The gift shop is excellent.
