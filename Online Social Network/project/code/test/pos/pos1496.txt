In some ways like all KFCs which would earn it 3 stars, but this one is much better than my home KFCs in WA.

Unlike KFCs I have visited recently, this one still makes food that tastes like KFCs of old. No low sodium gravy and chicken. This is the KFC food I grew up with. Yum yum... Eat in moderation... Also they allow substitution of sides on specials unlike my WA KFCs.

They did run out of original recipe when I was last there so I had to wait 10 minutes for my 7 piece dark meal order, but the food was piping hot and fresh when it came!

Friendly, fast service. KFC's online website has printable coupons nationwide BTW.
