The cashier was kind of a bitch, she looked really annoyed when I asked questions. I was really confused, since it was my first time and there were so many options and had a vague menu. What the hell is "squaw" bread? The lady said it was multi grain and sweet, so i was picturing honey-wheat. I ordered all the vegetables (sprouts, olives, pepper, tomatoes, etc) Once I sat down and unwrapped the sub, I was astonished by its size. it was HUGE! it wasn't the 6 in sub I'd get at Subway. It reminded me of Togos and their humungous and yummy subs. 
Well, this place was pretty similar to togo's-but more casual and this one had crappy customer service.
