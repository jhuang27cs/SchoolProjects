I absolutely love Teavana.  I have been coming here for a couple of years now.  I think almost every time I hit up Stanford Shopping Center, I also hit up Teavana.  Most of the staff is very knowledgeable about the teas, but there are a few brainless staff members.  After awhile, you begin to learn what teas go well together, and can call out the staff if they're recommended something you know you wouldn't particularly enjoy (this obviously coming from the rather lacking clerks).  I find that their teapots are a little overpriced, but I'll make an exception for some of those because of their design.  

The tea is always fresh and delicious.  I literally have 15 cans of their tea at home.  If you're going to buy and drink tea, this is definitely the way to go.  One good thing to be aware of is that the tea can get costly, so reuse your tins and always buy at least a pound because you'll get a discount.  

If you're coming here for the first time, try ordering a tea to go before you actually buy the tea leaves themselves.  Also, the prices in the booklets for the teas are for 2 oz, so don't be shocked when you get 6 oz of specially picked white tea and it's suddenly $35, plus the cost of the tin.  

Another hidden jewel here is that you can order a pot of tea, not just a cup.  So, if you plan on hanging out with a couple of friends at Stanford, take a little time to sit outside and enjoy a brewed pot of tea.  

The only major downsides here are that newbies normally don't understand protocol, which can get annoying to frequenters, and that the shop is small.
