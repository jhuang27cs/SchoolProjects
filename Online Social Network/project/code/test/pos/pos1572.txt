pretty much one of the only places close to me to go see "art" films.  it doesnt play the hardcore art films like brattle or coolidge corner might play but that is why it appeals to me - a main stream movie guy with a desire to see off beat artsy films once in a while.

my only complaint with this place is that with its full price tickets, it should have some better screens, seating and sound.
