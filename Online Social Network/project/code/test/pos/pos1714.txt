This is maybe the 5th Wegmans that we've visted.  While I'm not prepared to bash them I will say that the layout of this store is a little confusing.  All the great sh*t that you've come to expect from Weggies is still in there, some of it is just a little bit hard to find.

We always seem to find a boat load of things that we didn't really need while wandering around the store.  This means we usually spend twice as much as intended.  This latest trip was no different.
