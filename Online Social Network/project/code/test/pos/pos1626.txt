I'm mixed about this place. On one hand, it's a great small charming space that has an outdoor bar and a hip trendy interior.  On the other hand, I sometimes feel like I am amongst my dad's friends or something with the patrons...

With that said... The happy hours are still pretty great. Happy Hour lasts ALL NIGHT LONG on Monday! Great! They also offer discounted food.  We have had the fried green tomatoes which were pretty good.  Also tried the trip of fries which was quite good. I wouldn't recommend the cornflake fried chicken strips. Very dry and the sauce is just some honey mixed with jam.  The mac and cheese is worthy enough for you to try it if you are a die hard fan.

Try to get here early because it's small and you have to man your station before it gets crazy.
