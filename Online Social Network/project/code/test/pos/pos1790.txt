the place itself is very nice. staff was friendly. the wait wasnt long. they have nice selection of tattoos. i went to get my nose pierced. the lady asked me wich nostril i wanted it in and then made a white mark perfect the first time. it didnt hurt much. jus about how much a piercing is suppose to.  
the reason i give it 4 starts is because the area comes with problems. the parking is hard to find. but thats not really the place's fault... its in the area where it should be.
