First impression: Subtle sophistication tucked away from the busier Higuera Street.  Conveniently situated next to the movie theater.  Its a perfect place for quick cocktails and tapas before you catch a movie.  The drinks are well made, and tapas are tasty and delicious.   Service is friendly and good.
