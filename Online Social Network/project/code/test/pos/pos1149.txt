I cannot say enough good about Dr. McDowell.  She is competent, caring, gentle with the animals and shows genuine concern about their stress and discomfort.  Yesterday when working on my rabbits jaw abcess she had to stop a couple of times and just let him be a rabbit, as she put it.  He was gettin anxious and uncomfortable being on his back.  She didn't didn't run a bunch of diagnostic blood tests on a 12 year old rabbit who is doing fine but was in for a checkup (primarily to check teeth to avoid problems).  I appreciate that she has squeezed in my pets into an already busy schedule because they are sick.  She provides excellent care at reasonable prices and they do their best to either see your pet quickly or will refer you to an emergency hospital.
