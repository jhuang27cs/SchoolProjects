I, a long West Philly native and listener of 88.5 XPN was compelled to go to live at the World Caf√© Live for the first time in 16 years (believe it or not) because of free at noon. I have been reluctant to pay much more than $10 for concerts in the past, a standard which has reduced my live music repertoire. A friend brought me to the event to rightfully expand my horizons. She told me that she had seen Ray Lamontagne, a talented musician I appreciate at Free at Noon a year previous, and she gleefully coaxed me to go.  The performance seemed suited for a romantic, a lesser known artist playing to get his name out with not much hope of current revenue. He, calling solo A Capella a "risky move for performers," had nothing to lose and did exactly what he said could be haphazard. 
After a couple serpentine flights of stairs down to the lower lever and a bearded wild man with the face of Paul Bunyan playing a steel string acoustic, I appreciated the lay out of the performance hall, save for lack of chairs. It was vexingly intriguing to see suited day drinkers with older men and women taking time off work to come with their best friends from high school and such all huddled in the dark back of the room cheerfully making chit chat to the sound of bittersweet tunes apropos of better times.

I plan on returning for free at noon to see more of the venue XPN has to offer.
