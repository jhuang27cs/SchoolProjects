Henry's is a really nice break from the undergrad "college" scene in Berkeley. Usually its grad students or people from the hotel eating/drinking here. I also love that they show the euro soccer games, so I always go there to watch the games! Oh and if you haven't tried the food here, I recommend that you do! It is surprisingly good for a "bar." The caramelized brussel sprouts are AMAZING!
