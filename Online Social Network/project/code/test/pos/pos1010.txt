I really love this place! I travel quite allot for work and eat at a variety of places. However, I always have to hit up Daphne's in La Jolla Village when I get back. I love the Starter Hummus appetizer. Fire Feta is my favorite, however most people I've had try it, find it too spicy for them. Their lunch Pita Burger (I like mine with feta cheese on top) special with fries (you can also get rice and a salad instead) and a drink is an awesome deal and very tasty. I've been going there so often, that the people know me now and once in a while I can even get a free beverage or appetizer there. It's excellent quality for a chain eatery. I highly recommend it.
