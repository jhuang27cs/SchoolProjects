The massage therapist I was working with here (the lovely Alli Ross) has cut back her hours significantly in recent months, but I still wanted to review this place because everyone I've met here has been nothing but kind and genuinely passionate about helping people.

If you're looking for someplace for true massage therapy & care, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better group of practitioners.  It's not a spa, but the bodywork here is way better, and the prices are less expensive. Plus - when you're done, you can walk your totally relaxed self right across the street to BerryLine for a little frozen yogurt.  You'll feel just as pleased with yourself as if you'd spent a bunch of money for some upscale place downtown.

Also, and I hesitate to say this because it's hard enough to get an appointment with her as is...BUT, if Alli starts taking more hours again, do try and get in to see her.  I promise you will not regret it.
