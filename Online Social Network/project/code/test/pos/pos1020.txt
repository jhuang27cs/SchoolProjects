ALRIGHT, this is one of those NYC gems. This was "soul food" at its finest. I went here on a sunday afternoon, and dined on an overwhelming plate full of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, string beans, and corned bread. Aren't you full just even reading it? The food was excellent and I cannot wait to go back again. The service was friendly and the place was so cute.
