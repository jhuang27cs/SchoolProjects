Any restaurant with a roof deck is automatically worth checking out in my opinion and in this case the roof deck is actually pretty nice. The view is lovely in that you aren't surrounded by taller buildings on every side and there is a cute fence with flowers, making you almost forget for a minute that you are in fact on a roof. 

This was my third experience eating here and I have always had good service. The first time I went I was very excited to learn about the tasty pita bread and hummus you get to snack on while waiting for your meal. This time we got our meals before we had even made much of a dent on the pita bread. Okay, we were probably talking a bit excessively, but still. 

My meals in the past were nothing special (although the people I go with always rave about what they have gotten), but for my third visit I opted for the "special" - risotto. I was so excited to see risotto for once without seafood and instead with chicken, veggies and fresh chunks of parmesan. It was delicious - if only it made a regular appearance on the menu!
