Santa Fe Cafe was the best bar in College Park up until about the year it closed down.  Their specials were decent and dependable, usually always $2 bud or $2 rails.  On Wednesday nights they would sometimes have $2 Yuenglings or Rolling Rocks.

I never had an opportunity to eat at Fe, but if you're complaining about bar food in a college town, go to a real restaurant!  Bar food is typically always the same and never that good.

The best part of Fe was the live music it used to have usually on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  This was not like the other college bars because the music attracted a different crowd then the younger over intoxicated kids that just come to grind on each other.  They had great acts such as Afroman, Asher Roth, Busta Rhymes, Eve 6, Lit, The Bloodhound Gang, Junior Marvin, and many more!  It also supported all the amazing local bands in CP.  Ever since it closed, our music scene is almost non existent.  It was my favorite place in college park and I wish it were still open!
