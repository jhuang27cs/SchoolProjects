Samir has NEVER failed me.  I started coming to this restaurant way before it became Samirs.  I started coming when it was a sub shop, then Samir converted it to his Mediterranean Grill in Spring of '06.  I would say that his $3.50 sandwiches are the BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.  Not only are these things tasty, spicy, and fullfilling, but for $3.50 these things are damn near a steal.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Samir decides up the price for them soon.  As far as the plates go, they are fullfilling yet light!  I never thought I could eat a full meal, yet feel soo good about what I was eating.  A nice salad, the right amount of rice and meat, side of pita bread, and you got yourself a meal.  

I absolutely love Samirs service.  Always tells the server, to bring me a 7up(remember I'm a regular, or according to Samir, "Boss".)  He is quick on the getting the food prepared, cooked, and ready to eat.  If he isn't there, his sons and wife know how to pick up the slack and make sandwiches and plates just the way Samir does.:)
