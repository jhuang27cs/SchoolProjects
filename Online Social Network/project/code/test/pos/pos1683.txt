Was invited to have lunch here and the Chicken Sausage sandwich was perfect on such a cold Cambridge day.  I had lunch with Sergul Arshad, author of "40x40, The Luckiest Sports Fan Alive" and have to say that his luck runs great with restaurants too!  His tip:  EVOO is connected with the restaurant Za and if you sit at the dozen or so seats at the bar between the two you can order off of both menus!!  

I love that if you sat only 1 seat away, the wouldn't give you both menus! lol
