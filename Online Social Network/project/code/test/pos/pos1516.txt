I had to agree with a few other posters on the saltiness - I had a wicked Saganaki craving, and it was excellent (though they didn't do the fire at the table) EXCEPT for it was just too salty.  It overpowered the other excellent flavors.

My Chicken Souvlaki (sp?) was very good too but a smidge too dry and, like everyone said, a wee bit too salty (but not as bad as the saganaki).  It was still very good.

The Moussakka (sp?) on the other hand was some of the best I have EVER had.  WOW.  

Really hope management sees these comments and addresses the salt.  The food is genuinely good, and would be even better if they hadn't overpowered it with the salt :(.

The environment was great though - like being at family's house.  One of the employee's daughters was there and played with my son, giving us a little peace to eat our meal.  

I will definitely go again and hope and pray they de salt my saganaki!!!  (and I'll order the moussaki)
