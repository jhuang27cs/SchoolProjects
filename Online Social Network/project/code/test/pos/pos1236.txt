I am new to New York and live in Harlem by Honey Salon.  I had a partial sew-in in my hair and my hair is not relaxed.  The receptionist was really nice over the phone in making my appointment.  Yebirtha gave me a Dominican blow out w/my sew-in and did a great job!  Only cost me $45., deep condition included.  Downstairs Michelle & Cristy do weaves for about $250, the girls looked happy w/ their new dos :)  Prices are great for New York!  Nail salon downstairs as well.  I never got to see downstairs but upstairs was quiet and cute.  Best part of all, free bottomless mimosas!  I plan to go back again.  Hope that experience is good as my last.
