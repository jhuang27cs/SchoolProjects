I love YELP! I found this place through it and it's everything that the reviews say it is.

Great parking, AMAZING service, spacious, affordable, delicious, free samples, clean, free wifi, great hours, hip, nice tvs, great music, friendly.......

I could write a long review, but I'll just say it:
The best place to get frozen yogurt. IN THE WORLD.
