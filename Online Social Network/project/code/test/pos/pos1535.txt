An honest Chinese restaurant serving probably the most authentic Chinese food in the KW area.  Saturday and Sunday mornings are very busy with  dim sum patrons, which is a great time to go and try various delicacies as the hustle and bustle and loud conversation is all part of the fun.  

We've been going here for years and it's definitely one of my family's go-to places.  I highly suggest Crystal Palace for your Chinese food cravings!
