Went to Escobar's last night for a celebration dinner for our daughter.  We shared the guacamole appetizer, I had spinach salad with mango Chile dressing, strawberries and candied walnuts and for my entree, mushroom ravioli with saffron cream sauce.  Daughter had the beef kabobs and mango/rum cheesecake for dessert, and hubby had the roasted chicken with mole sauce.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine by the glass.  Waiter was attentive, but not intrusive, presentations were nice.  We all enjoyed our meals and will definitely go back.
