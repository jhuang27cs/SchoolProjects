Because so many other reviews are dead on about how good the food is, I will try to add something a little different.  

It was a beautiful summer day and we satoutside at a small bistro table, got served wonderful food, and had an incredible (catch up with an old friend) conversation - for as long as we liked.  The best part was the peole watching...Ann Arbor at it's finest.  It was like sitting front row at a parade of diverse, creative, interesting people.  So go here to kick back, relax, sit outside, enjoy great food and people watch.  It will make your day.

BTW - check out the Robot Supply & Repair store next door.  Very cool.  Awesome tee's.
