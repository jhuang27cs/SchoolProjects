Powell is pretty awesome. I have spent many midterms and finals seasons here. It's especially nice when you get a spot with an outlet, and you can camp out for however long you want. If you're planning on staying for that long, I suggest you bring some butt cushions cuz those wooden chairs are not comfy for long hours of studying.

My favorite is the reading room., where I used to scout out the areas for open couches to take my in-between-classes naps :D Uh.. I mean, study in between classes :P hehe
