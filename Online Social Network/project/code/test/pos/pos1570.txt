This place is heaven. These people know their stuff. Manie was not afraid to tackle the knots in my shoulders. She uses very firm pressure, which was so painfully good. Thai massage is probably my favorite type because you can wear clothes (comfy, soft ones they give you) and it incorporates stretching along with pressure. Love it. I am definitely going to become a regular here.
