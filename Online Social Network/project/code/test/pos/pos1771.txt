This place is pretty good, make sure to come early in the morning to avoid the crowd. I wouln't come here if I we'rent a student but its good for us. 

Just fyi, students already pay $45 per semester in student fees for the RSF even if they don't use it, just like we pay for AC Transit. On top of that we pay $10 to use it so in total, its $55 per semester.
