If you want good boba, look for the sign proclaiming Double Rainbow Ice Cream.  In the berkeley tradition of not taking down old shops signs, this marks Moccacino Cafe.

What isn't fantastic about this place?  They have the best boba I've found in berkeley, the barrista's are super friendly and fun to chat with during the off hours.  Only got a couple minutes between classes?  They're right across the street on the south end!

Oh and then there's the bento boxes.  $6 for an amazing filling lunch of veggies, meat, rice, and a tea egg.  What you say, only $1 for a bubble milk tea?  When you toss in the covered outdoor area, there is nothing this place does not do right.

I do wish they'd bring back the vietnamese sandwiches though.  I remember those from about 4 years ago when I first arrived in Berkeley.  They were the only place that made one that I liked in the area.
