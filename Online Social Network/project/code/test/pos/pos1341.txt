It's $12 for a mani, $30 for a mani-pedi. Let's get some perspective here.

This isn't a luxury service. This is a functional in-the-door-grab-a-colour-paint-your-nails-get-outta-here job. They're not going to inquire about your health, the weather, or what you're up to this evening. They're going to paint your nails... which is the service you're paying for. 

The best manicurist is Tom - he got married last year and is away on honeymoon/setting up home abroad, but when he gets back, trust me you want him. (If you want to see them all giggle with delight, you need to ask to see the wedding DVD. It's awesome. Their ongoing commentary is hi-LAR-ious.) Tom's French manicures kick the asses of all the French manicures at the luxury salons - he has an aesthetic that suits the, ahem, "European" lady who doesn't want her nails to look really fake or trashy. 

I always forget her name, but the curviest lady is the best for pedicures. I think she's Tom's sister. She gets rid of dry skin like nobody's business, and the nail varnish in her pedicures lasts forever. FOREVER.

Don't be a snob, don't expect the world to revolve around you, and you'll have a perfectly great time. If you think they're cutting your cuticles too much, TELL THEM (they may be foreign, but that doesn't make them stupid). 

Get your mani-pedis here, watch an amazing wedding DVD, saran wrap your own goddamn feet, and leave with your wallet still heavy.

The only reason I'm taking off a star is because they don't always accept credit cards, so always ensure you have cash on you.
