An unbelievable place! More variety, more yummy treats than I've found in any other supermarket or ethnic grocery in greater DC. OK, examples:
Fresh mushrooms: Wow - not just oyster mushrooms, also King Oysters, maitake, shimeji (hen o the woods) and lots of others, depending on when you go. Low prices. They have a great collection of dried fungi too.
Ice milk bars: Taro, red bean, green bean, black sesame, lychee are just some of the flavors. I try to ration them to myself.
Aloe vera juice: are you addicted yet? You're gonna need H&A - they have huge bottles in a crazy assortment of flavors.
