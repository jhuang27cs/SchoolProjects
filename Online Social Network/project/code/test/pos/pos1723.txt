Excellent, excellent, excellent! Service is wonderful and so friendly, the food is fresh and very tasty and it comes out fresh and hot. Nothing is overspiced to be overdone and it is well seasoned. Everything goes perfectly with a mango milkshake.

Highly suggest the lamb madras...if you like coconut and nuts mixed into a cream sauce, it's perfect. It's the right blend of tangy meets spicey. That with some rice and side of naan and a potato samosa to start and you could have a happy stomach!
