The best fro-yo in Harvard Square. The rotating flavored yogurts have all been really good, but I recommend banana and original.  The toppings are always fresh, with their fruit toppings taking center stage. With all the fresh fruit, it is easy to feel good about what you are eating. It isn't super expensive (especially if you have ever been to Herrells!) I really like that the yogurt tastes like yogurt and makes you feel energized instead of blah. If I had more disposable income, I would find many more reasons to stop by and have a medium with mango and strawberries. 

The seating at this location lacks, but it is just a really small space. Unless its really rainy or cold, it is easy to find a place outside.
