For years, my friend would always jokingly wear my glasses because (and I can't deny it) he thought he looked good in them. He even considered getting non-prescription glasses because he liked wearing them so much. Imagine how excited he was when he discovered he suddenly couldn't read street signs very well!

He and I have the same doctor and the selection there is terrible. So, I did some (Yelp) research to find the best place for me to take him to help him pick out his first pair. Seeing Custom Eyes had pretty good reviews, I figured we would start there.

Right off the bat, I felt comfortable in the neat, well-kept, organized and classy environment. Not to mention, very well-lit. You'd be surprised how many ophthalmology offices I've been in that were poorly lit and looked like someone put a desk in a glasses storage closet.. oh, the irony.

The man in charge, Kevork, was extremely helpful and - as someone stated before - was not at all pushy. I really hate pushy. Between the two of us, we were able to find my friend the best and most appropriate frames for his look and type: a pair nearly identical to mine.

To top off the experience, he fit the frames right there in under 10 minutes. In the 14 years I've had glasses, never once was I able to walk out of an office with my glasses after picking out frames. I thought that was pretty kick ass.

The next time I need glasses, I am definitely going to Custom Eyes. My review is only 4 stars out of fairness; neither of us had an exam there, but I'm sure it wouldn't deter me from a good review.
