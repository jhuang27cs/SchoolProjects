Wandered over here for dinner after enjoying some drinks and apps at Om. We were drawn in by what we found to be an excellent menu of solid, traditional New England fare. I enjoyed the almond crusted salmon ($17) with shrimp and risotto. My friend opted for the fish and chips ($13). My salmon was cooked perfectly. The portion was very generous. The mountain of risotto was gigantic. It was delicious but I seriously could not finish it. Her fish and chips were good, although the fries, I noticed, were thick cut (just not what I prefer). The food was so excellent, the portions so large and the prices fairly reasonable, that I am looking forward to returning. However, we noticed a weird, awkward scene at the bar. Small groups made up mostly of what looked to be Harvard grad students and a bunch of eco-friendly, activist peeps were circulating. There was even a chick there with a cotton long-sleeve shirt that read "I love non-profits". Um okay. As long as you concentrate on the awesome food, I am sure will enjoy this place. Stay away from the weirdness at the bar. We had to fight through it to get to the bathrooms. My only complaint aside from the weird singles or whatever scene was that the tables were a bit shaky and looked to be designed to look old and worn, but just looked pretty ghetto.
