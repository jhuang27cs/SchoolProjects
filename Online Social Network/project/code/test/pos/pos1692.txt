Ahhhh I think this place gets 3 stars for location and long lines, but 5 stars for their cheap and yummy ice cream sandwiches. My favorite is a chocolate chip cookie with a CHOCOLATE white chocolate chip cookie and cookies n' cream inside :) If you haven't tried this place yet, I recommend that you go with someone you wouldn't mind waiting in a long line with, who can enjoy sweets!
