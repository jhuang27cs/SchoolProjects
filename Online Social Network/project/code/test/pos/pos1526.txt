One of my favorites.  Totally random location.

The Mango sorbet (now passion fruit) / champagne starter is great, and the mango rolls are delicious.  For a less healthy option the chao zao rolls are greasy delights.

Favorite entrees include the scallops in coconut wasabi bisque and tamarind rack of lamb.  The mango chicken & eggplant is also very good.  You really can't go wrong with any of the duck options either.

They've opened a location in SF now and I had lunch there - same menu and same smiling faces - the staff is ALWAYS so friendly.
