what a genius idea - kings hawaiian bread for hot dog or hamburger buns!!!!

this place beats puka dog (in hawaii) and berkley dog for flavor, creativity, and atmosphere!

for the vegetarians, their veggie dogs are long enough to hang off the sides of the buns!!! i had it soooocali style and loved it so much, i might not get to try all the other combinations!

the sig other had the fonz and gave it 5 yelp stars!

other cool stuff
- they have bottled mexican coke and fanta, and yoohoo
- they make a sweetcorn/bacon milk shake - not for me, but sounds like something fun to try
- they make some good quality crispy (and not soggy) tater tots - they sweet potato tots i might have to try one day
-cool tipping jar says "not for cows" =)

thank you yelp for another great recommendation!
