Ok, I have recently discovered that Snowman's got a variety of changing soft serve fat free/low cal "Only 8" ice cream/frozen dairy like product.

Same price as soft serve. Delicious.

One of these days I'll try the hard serve, but for what it is - you can't go wrong with any of their soft serve items.

Give in to the rainbow sprinkles.

Also saw mastercard and visa stickers here, so looks like they are taking them now.
