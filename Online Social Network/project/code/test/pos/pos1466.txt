This spot reminded of a New York City restaurant in that it was small and dimly lit. The atmosphere was intimate and cozy, but there wasn't much in the way of decor that made it stand out. The service was very good; sweet hostess and attentive waiters. I was sad that they ran out of the lamb shank and oyster special, and I wasn't very impressed with the rose or Riesling that my date and I ordered or the beet salad, but the duck confit, roasted fall veggies, Basque mussels, fries, creme brulee, and dark chocolate torte + cafe au lait were outstanding. I have been trying to convince my boyfriend that he would like French food for years, and this dinner finally won me the argument.
