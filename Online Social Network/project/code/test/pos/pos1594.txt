My bf and I was looking for a place to grab a quick bite and we found this place on yelp. I must say that yelp never disappoints. The egg sandwich was amazing and I wanted to order another. OMG! We grab the chocolate, caramelized, sea salt macaroons for the road and it was to die for. The sea salt balanced the sweetness. It was so OMG good. yum~o! I can't wait for an open weekend to go again. Must try!
