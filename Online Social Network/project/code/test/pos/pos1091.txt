Being a non-C-U native yet someone who must spend a good portion of her life in the area, I've come to know many of the dining establishments in both the C and the U side of town.  Like so many other transplants, I find my emotions about dining in Champaign-Urbana range between two: either desperate for something decent or disappointed that yet another place stunk.  If you are looking for anything beyond a chain experience (Biaggi's, Chili's, Panera, etc.) the few diamonds in the rough are hard to come by.

Couple this with the fact that cupcakeries have sprung up across the country in the past few years like a blight, with little to no quality control or easy way to distinguish the good from the bad, and my concern about Cakes on Walnut was already piqued before even sampling their offerings. But that concern quickly evaporated after my first visit, and now Cakes is a must-stop for me, as I am expected to walk through the door in the city in which I reside with a box of the latest cupcakes from Champaign. 

Cakes delivers on its name by offering eight varieties of cupcakes each day, ranging from the staple (vanilla; red velvet) to the exciting (smore; limoncello).  Contrary to what a couple of other reviewers have said, these cakes do _not_ taste like a mix, but taste and are homemade - you can watch the process go down in the open kitchen area, if you like.  The frosting is delectable, although you will have a hard time avoiding wiping a fair amount of it on your nose as you attempt to eat it.

The ambiance is nice and charming, hand-painted with a swallow motif on the wall and cute, modern interior.  The bar is a nice touch and great place to enjoy a cupcake with a glass of milk or French press coffee.  The staff are friendly and warm and don't mind if you nurse your single cupcake for awhile, or grab them to go.

Cakes on Walnut is one of the few truly special food destinations in C-U and one of the few whose reputation crosses the city limits.  I am a fan.
