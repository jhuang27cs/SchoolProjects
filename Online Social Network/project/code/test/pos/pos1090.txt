I did my research and decided to come to Foothill Quickly Smog. I first viewed their Smog special on their website and then got a great deal! For a certificate I paid $35 and got a free car wash! Awesome special and a great price. It was so fast too! Less than 15 minutes for sure. It's located behind the car wash, literally on the back side of the building. 
Given their little secluded location, there is not much of a waiting space. Just some chairs outside. Not so great on a hot sunny day (like today) or a rainy day. Otherwise, I will be coming back.
