This place is great... very reasonable prices (about $30 for wash and cut... I believe the price can vary by stylist though), fun atmosphere, friendly staff. Biggest issue for me is its location -- for those of you that don't know, this is right by Pitt's campus. It can be hard to find parking. I think it's worth it though -- there is a garage near by if you're running late, and you can usually find a spot on the street if you're willing to circle the block a time or two.
