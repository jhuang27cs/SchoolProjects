This place is cool.  The atmosphere is definitely worth checking out.  The four stars were earned with the dark hallway leading to a tall box room full of beautiful spanish decor.  They are a little cramped on space so I'm sure the wait can be long.  

As soon as I ordered the vegetable paella I knew I had made a mistake though, it was unimpressive.  Paella needs salty meat or fish, which they have.  My bad.  So i don't think my opinion of the food should weigh heavily.  The sangria was good, the waitresses were nice, a little spendy but worth it for the atmosphere.
