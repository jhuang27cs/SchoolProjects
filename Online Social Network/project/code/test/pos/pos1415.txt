This edgy, minimalist pizza and salad joint is a breath of fresh air. Located conveniently across the street from the Harvard Square AMC movie theater, Cambridge 1 is a great place to go for a quick bite. The pizza is unique (with a very thin crust) and their topping choices are creative. They also offer great basic salads, a solid wine list, and perfectly delicious root beer. 

I recommend the Bibb Lettuce Salad and the Bolognese pizza. I love it and so does everyone that I recommend it to. :)
