I've been more serious about biking this year and commuted to work daily for the last month or more.  So, I need supplies, tools, advice, help and have been hitting up the cycle shops in my area.

See my other reviews on Ozone, University, Austin Bikes and The Peddler.

Having shopped all these place over the last year I have to say Freewheeling is the best for me.

They have a good selection of bikes for sale (mostly Treks) but I'm a do-it-yourselfer, so I can't say much about their bike sales.  We have three bikes at home I try to keep running in good shape.

Freewheeling always gives me clear advice, is straight with me about the differences in product quality (doesn't always try to upsell me), reminds me of little things that could be big problems (the correct way to insert a link on a chain tool!) and so forth.

I somehow always seem to get Tim and can't say enough about him; knowledgeable but easy-going, he respects your intelligence and answers your questions.  Prices are competitive with the other shops I've mentioned and seem to be $1 or $2 lower.

I'm a Freewheeling fan and shop here first.  Give 'em a try.
