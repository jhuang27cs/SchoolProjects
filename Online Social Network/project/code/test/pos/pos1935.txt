I don't live in Boston, so it's not like I go to this place every night. However, I have been to this place before every show I've attended at the Middle East (it's practically across the street) and I intend to go to The Enormous Room before any shows I attend there in the future. 

This is a great place to meet up with friends or to bring a date. The music is just background-beat, but it keeps you awake at least. Ambiance is Moroccan with a twist; one side of the lounge has raised platforms with tiny low tables and pillows to seduce your date on, the other side has modern couches with glass topped tables and leather stools. 

Their food is delicious, but don't expect too much variety. The Central Kitchen is right downstairs so if you're starving head there first. You're more likely to get a small appetizer sized meal in The Enormous Room. For the vegetarian, I suggest the Mediterranean Dip Plate (it's your only option unless you eat fish). They have the best drinks I've had yet in Boston, each one fancy and unique and totally make you feel like a grown up. I recommend La Perla, a mix of tequila, champagne, and strawberry puree. C'est magnifique!

Weekdays are better than weekends, as you can barely move in there on a Friday night. Oh! And the walls of the bathroom are covered in chalkboard paint, so you can write anything you want about that bitch and do little to no harm. Maybe that alone will get you to go.
