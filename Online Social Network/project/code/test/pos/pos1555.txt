A great TINY spot to grab a good lunch.  I've been twice now and have always been happy with my meal.  I can't seem to move past the turkey cobbler sandwich though.  The soups are nice and creamy too.  I've tried the pumpkin tomato and the tuscan bread.  Love.  Everything is decently priced.  The artwork is cool.  The only downside is the limited amount of space, especially during finals week!
