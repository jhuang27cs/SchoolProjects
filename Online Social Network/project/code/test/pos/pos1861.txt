The first time I came here they had just opened. Their credit card machine was not hooked up yet, and I had no cash. I asked the manager where the nearest ATM was and he said "we'll take care of you, go ahead and order, you can pay next time". This kind of service, and good food, is how you make customers for life. They recently hired a new guy behind the counter who makes a good cappuccino and latte, too.

There is plenty of seating inside and outside. On nice days people spill outside and sit on the ledges near the water clock (how do you read that thing anyway?).
