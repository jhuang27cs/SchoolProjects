My husband and I went here last night for his birthday.  It was our first time in and the place was much nicer than I expected from the outside.  The dining room was a fairly calm atmosphere for a sports bar, which was great for us.  We ordered beers, which were good, and shared a salad and a pizza.  The salad was okay -- the quality of lettuce could have been better and the dressing was a little heavy, but it tasted good.  The pizza was amazing -- we ordered the "Favorite," and I'm sure it will be one of our favorites!  The deep dish crust was crispy, not soggy like other deep dishes.  It was great, and the prices were very reasonable.  The service was excellent, too.
