Only after leaving Penn have I learned to really appreciate this bookstore.  I thought all University bookstores would be as extensive, but no such luck.  I am giving this bookstore 5 stars because of the extensive foreign language section.  Every time I am in Philadelphia I stop buy to pick up a few novels in German.  They don't just carry the novels that students are required to read for classes but they really have a good selection of literature in many languages.  I'm at Stanford now and although I think they also have a good language program apparently students are only expected to read the language books they have been assigned. The same goes for Johns Hopkins.  What's wrong with these schools, they have an international student body, you would think they would carry international literature. I am still loyal to Penn's bookstore.
