Staff is hit-or-miss; bitchy aloof or very nice and friendly. Decent selection of "designer" clothing, some of which I feel like is taken for the label even when it's a little too worn. I recently bought a silk Ellen Tracy blouse, a cropped short sleeve cashmere-blend Marni sweater and a Dooney and Bourke satchel bag, admittedly with some wear and tear - each item being about $20. Also at the Broadway location I picked up a DVF silk floral blouse for $12 from 2009 in perfect condition - um, wow! Lots of Free People stuff, plenty of J. Crew and Anthropologie, etc. Overall I like shopping here a lot, but be prepared to wade through a bunch of mediocre stuff before finding the gems that'll make you come back.
