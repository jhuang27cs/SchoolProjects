It's been a few years since I've been to the White Dog, so I don't know if there's been any major changes since I was there.   Went there with a large group of friends unannounced on a Friday night.  Although they were busy, they swiftly turned the restaurant upside down to accomodate us.  Our menu varied and we all enjoyed what we got.  I had a great salad.  We all had drinks and they were reasonably priced.  The ambiance of the place is very cool, I totally dug the interior.   The White Dog has a very cool vibe.

Good luck finding a place to park.  You're best off parking in the garage a few blocks away and hoofing it.
