Tucked right beside the frozen yogurt store (Pochi), I've come to know this place as a good lunch spot, then afterwards, consume dessert just a few steps away at Pochi. I remember one time, after camp, I was hungry as a physically deprived wolf, I could eat a whole cow. Literally, alive or cooked. Without any other second thought. Well, the owner had a smile and funny remarks to make while I ordered my food.

Got to go with Muchiko Chicken (battered and deep fried chicken), the batter was light as feather and it had the ultimate crisp. Crunch crunch crunch as I bite. It was music to my ears. 

Ridden with MSG, I can't continue to consume this, but I can't stop. It's so tasty and good, my brain had no control over my hands, my mouth keep chewing and my hand kept feeding my mouth. A never ending cycle, I've got no other choice. It was decorated with a plain ol' egg, I think it might have been better if it was poached, giving the egg's benedict effect- as I tear the egg with my spoon, the yolk starts to dribble down the fried rice. That would've been flawless scene. Sadly, it was just a fried egg, greasy and eggy. The fried rice was okay, the real highlight was the muchiko chicken. I don't get how they make the batter so light and great, batter covered more than the chicken, yes, that's what I want.

The portions are big, worthy of the price. A cheap, filling lunch that left me satisfied and dizzy from a food coma/MSG overdosage. Still a smile on my face, a content damn happy smile.

My pack of wolves all ordered muchiko chicken, it's that good. Only in that we indulge and go wild. It's all for the sake of you humans, so we don't eat the last of you and let you live in peace and harmony. We submit to the pact we have made with the Mongolians far thousand years ago, we shall not harm each other if you continue to make these wonderful Muchiko chicken as a peace offering. You have held true, so we stay grounded to our promise.
