I'll admit it...we go to this Fashion Cleaners because it's right around the block from us.  We go here regularly to get all our dry cleaning done.  They are fast and efficient and do a wonderful job.  Their facilities are nice and clean.  

Right next door is the Fashion Cleaners tailoring site.  For a bridesmaid dress I had to get tailored and fitted, they did an amazing job and did it quickly.  

While their dry cleaning isn't the cheapest, it is definitely worth it.  I'm not sure how the prices for the tailoring services go, but I had to get a hemline taken up, the shoulders taken in and it was around $30, which I thought was a good deal.
