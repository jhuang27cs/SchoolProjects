Jude & Me is a hidden gem. I had Antonio, and he did an amazing job. I brought him a photo and he studied it, asked me if I was sure I wanted it that short, and then adapted it perfectly for my hair (very thick, tending towards puffiness). Afterward, he taught me, patiently, how to put product in it to spruce it up. 

As an added bonus, I felt no pressure to make awkward conversation. Kind of a nice change, thought I think that's because he doesn't seem to speak English all that well. The other stylists were chattier with their customers.

It's cheap too. $50 for a woman's haircut, and $45 with a student discount. That's way less than I expect to pay for a haircut of that quality in Manhattan.

The space is a little shabby. I found myself wanting to Windex the cabinets, and the little capes they put on you are some sort of tacky, shiny material. Worth it, though.

Go here now! I'll be coming back.
