DJ was awesome!  The drinks - good since I can't remember much.  We danced and danced and danced...  Thank goodness for pictures to remind me of the night.  Enough said - you'll have a great time here!!!  We need a place like this in my hometown.  This is an apparent hot spot because when we left the line was out the door, around the corner and down the street.  Get there early to ensure you have a chance to get in!
