So, this is how ridiculous I am.  We get our rescue kitty and I go in to the store and say, "Hi, I am looking for a new food for a cat we just got.  My husband and I are Vegan so we would like to get something that is sustainable and if possible, local, and overall does as little harm as possible."  

Okay, i am pretty sure I would have laughed in my face and sent me away.  After all, it is a cat and this is cat food.  The girl did not even blink.  Instead, she took me back and showed me foods that actually met my criteria!!  Cat food produced in British Columbia by a family company that uses only wild caught fish?  Thank you, i will take it!!

They will give you samples of dry foods and let you sample up to three cans of wet food per visit, but you can keep coming back for as many samples as you need.  The staff is well trained and has even opened up cans to tell us if it is a gravy or pate food. (Have I mentioned our cat is spoiled?)  I would say that this U-village store definitely has the most helpful staff of the stores I have visited.  They have helped us find food through allergies and jaw surgery and supplements for when our cat needed to put on weight after an accident.  They also have a great selection of toys, cat trees and litters.  I don't know what we would do without Mud Bay.
