Nice decor and really earnest staff. I got cornbread to start with, and it was very good. For the main course my friend and I both ordered the chicken breast and waffle combo, we both got chicken thighs on the side since we were hungry. I got the truffle honey syrup, as recommended by my server, and it was a great compliment to the meal.

The chicken is really the highlight here. The crust is hard, but whatever batter they use is fantastic and the flavors are amazing. I preferred the thigh meat to the breast, as the skin/crust to meat ratio was better I felt. The waffle was lightly spiced and paired well with the meat and syrup. I didn't have room for dessert, but maybe next time. I would give it 4 to 5 stars for food and service, but it's quite pricey for the amount of food they give you. I'm used to getting soul food served in large portions, but these were a little on the small side. My friend and each ended up paying about $20 for the meal. We ordered sides, but that's what it took to get us full. It's worth checking out, and I'll definitely be back to get my fix of some classy twists on southern classics.
