Very good Persian food, very fresh with some of the best kabobs in town. I go here at least twice a month, and have done so for 5-6 years, and I have NEVER been disappointed. Its run by a family, and they all seem to enjoy serving you.

The kabobs are all great, but the House one is recommended. They have special of the day, but they often run out pretty early in the day.

The place is small though, only 1 or 2 small tables inside, a small counter, and 1-2 tables outside. 
Most people buy food to go, but parking can sometimes be tricky, but you may find parking next to the liquor store. RECOMMENDED!
