They make my favorite bibimbop in town.  It's a mom and pop place for sure...but nothing wrong with that.  don't go in looking for a nice decor or lots of flair.  it's a small menu...but pretty much everything is pretty good.  service can be a lil slow if there's a couple tables in there but usually worth the wait.
