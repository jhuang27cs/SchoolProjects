My sister and I passed by the store by chance on our way from Sprinkles cupcakes. Pronouncing the name of this store was easier than I imagined as long as I said "Hlaska Alaska" in my mind. They had the wallets on display and even during a rainstorm, we could see the quality  of the leather and were impressed with the stitching once we inspected more closely. 

The women's bags and accessories were on sale but sadly for good reason. The design was not chic or anything similar to what I'd be expecting from a store which such awesome leather and fabric bags. Their laptop cases and messenger bags are top notch and I've never seen such quality like this before-not from Eddie Bauer, Chrome, or Timbuktu. 

I have a feeling the designers of Hlaska once worked in SIlicon Valley or something 'cause the bags were definitely made for Macs. It fit like a glove once my Large Caliper messenger bag got home with me too. Like peas and carrots, my MacBook Pro has a home in my new Hlaska.
