Jaime was AMAZING.  I had some problems with my hip  (Yes, I'm secretly a 78 year old), and I went and saw Jaime and it was just an absolutely wonderful experience.

I've never had PT before, but I learned a lot of great stretches and exercises.  In about 6 or 7 visits, I went from walking being painful, to being able to use the elliptical again (albeit for only a few minutes at at time).

I really felt like Jaime gave me everything I needed to recover, and once she felt I was solidly on my way, she told me I was all set and that I could do the rest of it on my own.  I really appreciated her honesty about closing my case, and saving me the time and the money!

Another big plus in my book was that it was easy to get an appointment at Back on Track, and the location is really convenient for those of us without cars (right in the Charles Hotel complex, actually in the Wellbridge), just a few minutes from the T at Harvard Square.
