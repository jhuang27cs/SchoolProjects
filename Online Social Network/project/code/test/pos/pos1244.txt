Good place to play pool on weeknights or during the afternoon / early evening hours on weekends.  Usually not too crowded then.  They also have darts which is fun.  

They have awesome bean dip and bean tacos!  I order it every time I go.  The bar can be a little slow to get a drink once it starts getting crowded.  Only over 21 crowd allowed in the evenings.  And this is more of an "alternative" crowd so you usually don't have to worry about "frat packs" here.  I enjoy this place.
