The prices are a tad high, but I enjoyed my first dinner at The Capital Grille. The wine list is impressive; the classic cocktail menu posh. As you would assume, the steaks are flavorful, tender and prepared well. The service was 100% on point. The waiter kept my boyfriend's soda filled throughout the night, and he seemed to be there just when we needed him.

We started by splitting the wedge salad, per the waiter's suggestion. He was nice enough to split it in the kitchen and bring out two plates. The dressing was the highlight of this salad, but the iceberg was in top form as well (I tend to have bad luck with the quality of iceberg in any wedge salad I order).

For entrees, we both got a filet -- mine was filet Oscar though, and I am so glad I tried this. It came out piled high with large chunks of crab meat and creamy Bernaise. The meat was cooked perfectly. For sides, I highly recommend the mashed potatoes. They are creamy and seasoned well with a sprinkling of red skins mixed in. The asparagus with Hollandaise was ok. The Hollandaise sauce was very thick, and the asparagus was slightly undercooked for my taste.

Since we were celebrating my birthday, the waiter brought out a flourless espresso chocolate cake on the house. It was outstanding: light but still rich. We polished off the whole thing.

Now, my reasons for knocking off a star... my boyfriend's filet was cooked unevenly, which completely confounded me since this is one of the steakhouses among steakhouse greats. Also, there was the slightest chip in my martini glass. Not a huge deal, but I would expect perfection from an establishment like The Capital Grille.

While I would save a full dinner for the utmost of special occasions, I definitely want to go back for drinks and appetizers (which are reasonably priced). You could make a meal out of the appetizers, salads, soups and sides for under $30.
