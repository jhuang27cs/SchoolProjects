Its really hard for me to describe this place for the Yelp audience. Lets just say, this was my first cafe I went to as a college student, I met my future wife there, and I proposed to my now wife there. Besides these emotional connections, this is one of the best hangout spots in Amherst. Good coffee, large space, welcoming people and workers. Students, professionals, and Amherst residents are always there. Loved the fact it has consistent hours and always open until 11 PM (I am a caffeine addict because of this place so I need coffee at 11 PM to function). So many great memories there, I hope everyone has great memories there.
