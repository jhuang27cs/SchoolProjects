I've been going to school in the area for over 4 years and have actually never been in this place till there was a groupon for it. Bought it and tried and was really surprised when I went in and saw.

The set up is cute. They have tons of cupcake options and their cookies looked delectable. 

I ended up going with a half of a turkey & brie panini and the red curry. It was quite yummy except fro the massive slice of tomato on the panini. Also got an iced pumpkin spice latte that was delicious. Not as sweet as other places, but still good.

I will definitely be coming back here and trying more things out, especially with it being so close to Virginia Tech's campus
