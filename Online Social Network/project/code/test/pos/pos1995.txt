The meal I crave most is Dun Dun Noodles and Suan La Chow Show .  I've been going to Mary's since the 80's and it still tastes the same every time.  On most days you will find Mary walking through the dining room greeting customers.  As Patrick B said, you should come here for the food. You won't regret it.  Large portions of good food for a reasonable price.

They do tend to make things on the spicy side, but are very accomodating if you need to tone it down.  Just let them know, if you like your food on the milder side or without msg.
