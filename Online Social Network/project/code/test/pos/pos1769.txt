3.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the atmosphere. We had dinner here last weekend with a friend and the time slipped by as if we were in a time warp. Good conversation in a dimly lit, cozy restaurant will do that to you. The food itself was tasty, although the portions were a bit large for my tastes. Decent selection of by-the-glass wines and a few South American beers that are hard to find rounded out an overall fun experience. We'll definitely be back.
