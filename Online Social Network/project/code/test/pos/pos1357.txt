My boyfriend and I found ourselves wandering into this little shop after dinner at the Lafayette Brewing Company, and I am so glad we stopped by.  

It's not just an ordinary antique store.  It's cluttered, but in a good way - not messy, just full.  They have a ton of great stuff to look at, and if you're looking for costume, vintage, or just unique jewelry at a really good price, this is the place to go.  I bought two vintage glass pearl necklaces for $5!

There is so much neat stuff in here, it's hard to detail it all.  They have everything from vintage handbags/hats to old medicine bottles - I was able to pick up an old bottle of DeWitt's Cough Expectorant for $2, which I thought was just great since I'm a pharmacy student.

The owner is also exceptional.  She's just about the friendliest person you'll ever meet, and she can chat with just about anybody.  

If you're into looking at vintage things and just want to peruse, stop by.  The best part is they play 1920s music in the store!
