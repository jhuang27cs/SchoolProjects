Another great burger joint found!

Cheeburger Cheeburger has a very retro, 50's vibe to it. This may seem off-putting to those looking for a gourmet style burger, but have no fear, this place offers amazing food!

The menu was a bit overwhelming, but they helped us figure out what was going on and ordering became quite simple. My fiance and mother shared one of their gardenburger wraps (huge plus that they offer veggie burgers, by the way), and I got a "Serious" burger (1/2 lb) cooked medium with cheddar, sauteed onions and mushrooms, guacamole, and jalapenos on top. We also ordered a medium basket of fries along with zesty horseradish and creamy jalapeno dips.

First off, I know they enjoyed their veggie burger wrap. My fiance is very picky about getting veggie burgers, as only certain patties appeal to her, and she loved this one. The fries were also very good, we topped them with their signature seasoning, there was a ton in the basket, and they tasted excellent with the sauces. But the clincher, IMO, was my burger. I was amazed at how big, juicy, and perfectly cooked the patty was. Topped off with all my favorite choices, as well as some of the jalapeno dip to add some kick, and this is one of the best burgers I've had at any place! I can definitely say I'll be visiting Cheeburger Cheeburger a lot more now that I know how good the food is here!
