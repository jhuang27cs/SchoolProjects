A berkeley landmark. Been here since my freshman year, the coffee is pretty good. The setting is beautiful, outdoor seating (with heating) as well as indoor seating. Love their white mocha ("mocha bianca"), but they aren't really big for re-fills/byom. They give you $0.10 off...seriously? 

That aside, just a really pretty place to have coffee, do homework, hang out. Sometimes hard to find setaing though.
