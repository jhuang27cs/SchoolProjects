I was trying to think of places I would miss when I finish my Master's program here in Champaign-Urbana and the top three are Murphy's, Canopy Club and Zorba's. 

I've always been a fan of gyros and I have to say that these are right up there with the ones I get in Chicago. In fact, Zorba's is better than some of the gyros I've gotten in Chicago before. 

This is my favorite place to eat on Green Street. Besides Antonio's, it's probably the only one that not a chain and I unequivocally love the Large Gyro combo plain with a Cherry Pepsi.
