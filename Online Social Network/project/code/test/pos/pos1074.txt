The "Big night out" is exactly that, look to throw down over a hundred bucks for two after drinks and gratuity. These guys put the "Fun" in Fondu, Matt our server had his hands full with our rag -tag group of "Fondu virgins" but had us dipping and laughing in no time. This is a great place for groups and we all had a great time with our skewers. My 3 year old son grabbed a hot skewer a couple times so I'd say it's kid friendly if the kid is over 4 or 5. We also noticed a group come in just for dessert, I think we'll do this next time. Even though it's flanked by Flemings and a upscale seafood restaurant, the vibe is still pretty casual and the servers are nice and personable. Definitely a fun night out, just be prepared to dig deep and eat peanut butter and jelly sammies for the next week :)
