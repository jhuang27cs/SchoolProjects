I believe this restaurant opened recently under this new name.  They used to be called India Palace Cuisine.  I don't know if management changed also, so the food I ate might not be representative of what it was previously.  In any case, I became aware of this restaurant because I received a menu of theirs in the mail with some tantalizing coupons.  They have a decent selection of dishes, but what surprised me were the prices.  Most dishes are between $7-10.  I thought this was suspicious because I'm used to Indian food costing at least 12 bucks.  With prices this low, something has to give, right?  Well as it turns out, the answer is yes and no.  My sister and I ordered Take-Out from here.  We ordered 2 garlic naan and 3 dinner entrees and the total cost was only 28 bucks (including tax).  The best choice was their  eggplant dish (Baingan Bhartha).  The spiciness was just right and flavors were absolutely delicious.  The next best thing we ordered was the Saag Paneer.  This dish was good, but not anything spectacular.  I wish they put more Paneer in it!  The disappointment came in the forum of their Shrimp Vindaloo.  The menu stated "jumbo" shrimp, but the shrimp were actually quite small and the sauce was too tomato-ey and thin.  I would not recommend this dish.  The garlic naans we got, however, were fluffy and tasty and chock full of garlic.  I can't say anything about the service since I didn't dine-in, but when we walked in to pick up our food the waiter was pleasant.  I will definitely order from here again, but I'll be more cautious with my choices.  Honestly, with prices this low I can afford to taste everything at least once!
