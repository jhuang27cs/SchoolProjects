I love this car wash! This is the best thing for people that like to wash their own car but don't have time to do the whole thing. Before you pull in and get your car washed there is an area for you to scrub your tires and wheels. There is also a bug sprayer with a soapy solution to get the bugs off your car. Then you get back in your car and pull through the car wash. 

I don't do any of the special features, I just get the basic $4 wash. You get a coin to vacuum your car for free! Then you pull through the wash. After the wash I dry my car off with a towel I keep in my trunk. Then you get the chance to use your vacuum coin. I don't use them each time. I stash them in my cup holder then have a big vacuum fest every couple months since my car needs washed a lot more often that it needs vacuumed. 

This place is the best for someone who likes to do car work themselves. You don't have to tip someone since you do most of the work! Also no one else drives your car. I would just rather be in charge of my car. So this is great for me!
