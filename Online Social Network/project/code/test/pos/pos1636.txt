We have been going to Arrufo's for a couple of years now, and they offer excellent Italian dishes. My favorites are the lasagna and the penne with tomato vodka sauce, but perhaps the best item is the rustic loaf of Italian bread, topped with a delicious tomato sauce! It is fabulous, and they serve it with a basil olive oil that is to die for! The setting is very cozy and intimate and makes for a great date night! I would highly recommend stopping by if you are in downtown Claremont...this is simply one of the best dining establishments they have to offer.
