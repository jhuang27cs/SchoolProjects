Abricott is an ABSOLUTE MUST VISIT in Pasadena!!   

My wife and I live walking distance from Abricott and we watched it grow the past couple of months during the construction process.  When it was finished, we were blown away with the design and decoration on the inside.   It's one of the most uniquely decorated restaurants I have seen to in Pasadena!

Before I even talk about what we ordered, I think it's important everyone knows that this place has the same owners as Daisy Mint (#10 restaurant in Pasadena via Tripadvisor.com). We all know how amazing Daisy Mint is.  

They are still shaping the menu and have only been in business for about a week.  For only being in business a week I was very impressed that this place was packed on a Wednesday night at 8:30pm.  

We ordered Ice cold Coconut water served in the coconut which was incredible.   My wife ordered the Pho and I had the yellow curry.  Both meals were excellent.  

The best part about this place was the staff is genuinely nice.   They genuinely care about each and every customer and are very appreciative of your business.  

If you are looking for a new place to try, this is it.    I would come as quickly as you can because once word spreads about this place, it's always going to be packed!
