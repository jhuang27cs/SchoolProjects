I am picky as hell and when I find a place I like, I tend to order the same thing over and over - which makes me not such a great reviewer.

At this place I tend to always get steamed chicken and vegetables, or steamed tofu and vegetables, white sauce on the side.  The food is always steamed just right and keeping the sauce on the side eliminates any "typical greasy chinese food" quality.  Plenty of food, nicely done.

Their hot and sour soup is good but I wish it didn't contain pork.  But most places do.

The reason I need to review this place is because they have got the best steamed vegetables dumplings you will find anywhere in America - and I am writing this from CALIFORNIA where I am surrounded by Asians so I should know!!!

OK, maybe I am not a dumpling expert.  But theirs are damn tasty and I wish I could find something like them out here.  Every time I go home, I need to get pho at LuLus and dumplings at Silk Pagoda.

They are AWESOME.

I wish I could have a truckload shipped to me.
