I may be biased, I may also me cursed, because I can't find a slice of pizza anywhere that compares to Pizza Star's Pizza. 

Now, I've been eating this pizza since I was a toddler. I got fat on this pizza once I was old enough to walk or ride my bike to the Princeton Shopping center. Since I left Princeton, I have had a hard time finding a slice that even compares to the thousands of slices I've had at Pizza Star. I have arguments to this day with friends who are from different areas of Princeton about the best Pizza in town. You have those who say Victors was the best, others who claim Conte's makes the best pizza, but they pale in comparison. Pizza Star's Pizza, is a wide slice on thin crust. It passes the slice-fold-test that all slices should pass. Conte's is a small greasy slice. Aside from the nostalgia of the place, Conte's really lacks. Stop into Pizza Star and you will run into guys who have been there for over 30 years spinning dough and spreading sauce the way Pizza is supposed to be prepared. 

Now I'm all worked up, I may have to jump on the road and endure the 7 hour ride to Princeton to enjoy a real slice, plain, pepperoni or otherwise.
