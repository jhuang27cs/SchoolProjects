Bowbarr is a pretty cool bar.  It's not too loud, and has lots of places to (comfortably) sit.  The decor looks custom made and fits the space well (except for the dining room table in the back, weird).  Love the multi-colored glass light bulbs around the bar which keep the space lit but still lend a lot to the ambiance.  Tasty drink specials like michelada, sangria, a lemony vodka thing, and the ubiquitous (in Carrboro at least) dark & stormy.  I was paying too much attention to the people I was with to fully notice the crowd, but no one seemed lame, mean, or creepy.

Members only, membership is $5, and a plus-- the membership cards are the coolest around.  A minus-- only one bathroom.
