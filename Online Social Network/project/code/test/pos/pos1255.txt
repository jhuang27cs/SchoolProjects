Best brazilian wax ever! 
I moved to the bay area from NYC about six months ago and I was nervous about finding a good waxer out here. I used to go to the famous J-sisters in New York so im used to quality waxes but Valerie at Studio Abasi has far exceeded any of my previous experiences. Clean, thorough, and virtually painless-- this woman really knows her stuff. I leave smooth and I am always ingrown free until my next appointment. Great place!
