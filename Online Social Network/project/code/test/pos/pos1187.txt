So, I'm creating a yelp list on the good, the bad and the ugly on drive thrus.  

This is the closest Mickie D's to my office.  Even though it's right smack in the middle of college students and the capitol complex, I believe it's one of the fastest Mickie D's in Austin.  During morning rush hour, there's always a line in the drive thru.  However, I timed it to be a 4 minute waiting process to order, pay, get my food, and get out of dodge.

4 stars on service....
