This is the best sushi restaurant ever!  An excellent sushi restaurant should have these key elements, fresh fish (not frozen), professionally trained sushi chef (trained in Tokyo or Osaka), a down home ambiance, friendly staff, and wide selections.  Matsuri's has it all and then some.  It is a family owned restaurant and you will be made to feel welcome and part of the family the second you step in.  The fish is bought daily directly from the fish market!  The Matsuri brothers, (the sushi chefs) are also avid fishermen and will sometimes share their catch with everyone at the bar!  They are all about the customer...you can get it your way...they will custom make rolls for you.
The only complaint I have about this wonderful venue is that the sushi bar is a bit small.  You will have to get there early if you want a seat at the bar because there are so many regulars that will hog it up (speaking of self).  
Best Toro you will ever have!
