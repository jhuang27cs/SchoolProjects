I think that there are probably certain experiences that can define how fundamentally cool you are and where you best fit - meeting a celebrity, ability to pick a wine off the wine list, accurate pronounciation of European words.

Enormous Room has those loungy style couches and pillows that are kind of hip and stylish.  I came here for a scotch tasting (AWESOME by the way - loooove The Macallan!) and saw that seating situation and started having some legit social anxiety.  Even when drinking manly 21 year old scotch, it is hard to be totally masculine when i have to lay out on a giant sofa like a beached whale.  Luckily, I found a normal couch across the aisle to park at - phew... that was close.

Enormous Room is pretty sweet, the apps were good, and the place was just cool - although probably a little too cool for my speed if I was finding a Friday night hotspot.
