Interesting to see the range of reviews here. I'm not sure what to make of the gap. My experience has been very positive. The stylists are extremely sweet. They work quickly. They give good haircuts, and they are reasonably priced. Be neither put off nor enticed by the "New Age" in their name. I think it is an empty signifier. I'm not just a dude who doesn't care how his hair looks, I should say. In fact, I'm a bit vain about it. So, I'm always psyched when I find a good barber, and I guess the New Age stylists are more on the barber end of the spectrum. I see that many people mention that New Age is adept at cutting "asian hair." This may be. I don't know. It may also be that my hair and "asian hair" are similar, which may explain my frequent frustration with other barbers. My hair is very thick and very straight. If your hair is like that, I recommend New Age.
