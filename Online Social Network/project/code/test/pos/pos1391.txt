I like lamonica's more but Enzo's is pretty legit, good prices, though the sandwiches get a little pricey. I guess my main qualm is that it's a little too classy for a pizza joint. I can't picture myself with a couple of pitchers watching the game there. In fact i don't think they even serve booze. Anyways solid food at solid prices and they're open late which means i still go there pretty often.
