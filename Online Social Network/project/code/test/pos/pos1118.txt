Here's my pitch:  I watched as this store was built from the ground up.  I thought it would be just another over-priced Palo Alto boutique unaffordable to the normal low-maintenance woman such as myself.  This afternoon, I put my skepticism aside and walked in.  I have to give them kudos because they have proven me wrong in every way possible.  This boutique has fantastic shoes by big and small name designers from $30 - $300.  But here's the clincher:  all of the profits go to the Global Fund for Women!  How ridiculous is that?!  A retail store with a conscience.  Double plus bonus points goes to them because they are offering free manicures through november to anyone who purchases shoes.  I'll be coming back here often let me tell you.
