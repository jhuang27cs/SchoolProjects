This place has really good food and is reasonably priced.  I was surprised so may BBQ places overcharge and don't taste good, ribs too dry and no flavor.  I had the cowboy reuben and was a little hesitante to order beef brisket b/c a lot of places don't cook it right and it is dry.  Boy was it not dry and was so delicious.  We had the chocolate chip cookie ice cream bar for dessert and it would have been even better if the cookie was softer, or even served warm.  Really good and will make the trip next time we want a good BBQ lunch/dinner.  If you are contemplating give it a try I bet you won't be disappointed. YUM!
