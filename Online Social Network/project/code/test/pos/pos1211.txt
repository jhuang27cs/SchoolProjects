After some less than desirable results with other MTM shops in NYC and online MTM shirts, I've had fantastic results with Bindle & Keep. I'm extremely pleased with the end product as well as the customer service both during and after the delivery has been outstanding. After purchasing one suit I went back for two more. 

Options: Very good selection of fabrics at different price points as well as all the normal custom options.

Price: Reasonable. You can't expect to skimp on a MTM suit and get good results. B&K's prices are very reasonable for what you get (including free alterations).

Customer Service: Outstanding. Very attentive, responsive and fair. The whole experience with B&K was very "personal" and I felt like my business was important, no matter what I was purchasing. Thankfully I had no issues, but I'm confident that Daniel would work to promptly rectify any issues and would not rest until every customer is satisfied.

Thanks for the great suits!
