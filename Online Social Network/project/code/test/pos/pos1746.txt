This was a pretty comfortable place to live and I didn't have any issues with the neighbors, though occasionally we'd get a whiff of smoke from someone else's porch.  There are two parking garages and you can get an assigned spot.  It can suck for visitors trying to find parking nearby, but sometimes you could get away with just grabbing a random spot in the garage for a bit.

It comes fully furnished and they had recently upgraded the couches when I was there a few years ago.  Unfortunately you have to use Time Warner and there were always issues with the service... I'd see a TWC truck out on the street at least once a week.  There was also that one time there was an electrical explosion underground, which was crazy.  We didn't have power for most of the night.

The location isn't too far from campus and it's a quick walk down to In'N'Out and the rest of Westwood.  Since it's a university apartment, there was a hotline you could call to get any sort of service, or you could go visit your AC (apartment coordinator), who was kind of like the RA for the building.  They had plungers and light bulbs and a vacuum, which pretty much covers the basic things you'd need.
