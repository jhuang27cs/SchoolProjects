This review is a long time coming...Seriously. 

The only downside I can think of is that this place is not around the corner from me. I legitimately have to travel for the pleasure, which, I am not a fan of as I 100% believe in instant gratification. 

ALAS!!!! 

I walked in and was violently attacked by the neon green walls, the hamburger man statue, and the bumping sounds of Beastie Boys. Being of last night's sorts, (if ya catch my drift), I felt like I had just come out of a cave after 12 years and saw the sun. God it was painful. 

Once the coffee was poured and my eyes got used to the Green Monster, (no shit, seriously), I began noticing the kitschy art all over the walls. CRAAAAZY. Fast forward 20 minutes and I had a HUGE, delicious Lox bagel accompanied by a side of cheese fries. FANTASTIC! It was everything I was craving and the Gorgonzola on the cheese fries put me over the edge. 

The best part?  The spicy strawberry dipping sauce for my Gorgonzola cheese fries.  I devoured the plate.  No evidence, no crime.
