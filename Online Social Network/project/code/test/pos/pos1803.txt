I was a little hesitant about the whole "healthy burger" concept, but I shouldn't have been! SO YUMMY! I really do like a leaner, smaller burger, so b.good is right up my alley.

I got a little burger with cheddar and BBQ, and it was absolutely perfect for a lighter lunch. My mom, the queen of tiny portions actually finished hers with praise, and practically licked the container holding her special sauce clean. (And now I feel a little dirty for writing that sentence...)

There's an amazing selection of salads too, and I love the farmer profiles on the wall. B.good is an awesome choice when you're looking for a little meat on the lighter side.
