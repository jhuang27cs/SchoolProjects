Hands down, the best place to have drinks for the sake of having the best drinks.    This is one of those bars where you shake your bartender's hand, exchange names and get service that's as good as the cocktails.  And if you don't know what you want, you are in expert hands.  Every drink I've asked the guys to make, by just giving them a rough description of what I'm looking for, has been spot on.

They have the largest selection of liquor that I've seen in the Chapel Hill area and well beyond.  Sounds odd, but their ice is great, the cherries are delicious and they make their own tonic.  Bartenders wear bowties and the wood-paneled decor rounds out their modern day Cheers vibe.  "The Crunk".  I love it.
