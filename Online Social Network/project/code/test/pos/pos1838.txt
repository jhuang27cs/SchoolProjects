This is a really great coffee place on the Georgia Tech campus. The place is in the lobby of the Petit Bio Engineering building. 

They have GREAT coffee and absolutely fantastic sandwiches. You can get both regular and heated sandwiches. The line can be pretty impressive around lunch time, but they are effective in processing it. 

This is a place with an attitude. The people are really great and engage in discussions, ... if you have not tried it you have to go.
