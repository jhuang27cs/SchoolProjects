Reviewing In-N-Out is like reviewing your grandmother. Your love is a given (unless, unfortunately, your grandma sucks).

It doesn't matter if you're Thomas Keller or the pickiest 9-year-old eater in America, In-N-Out is/will be legendary to you. Fresh. Delicious. Amazing. 

Anyone that's grown up in LA has some great memories picking up burgers late night with friends. It's a big part of the SoCal experience. 

When I went to college in the Midwest, I would have paid $100 for a 3x3 meal with a shake. It's a taste of home.

This is why In-N-Out is my #4 best burger in LA.

(In writing this review, I convinced myself to pick up some In-N-Out)
