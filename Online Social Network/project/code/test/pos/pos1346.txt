One of my favorite places to go and hang out. This place has fast and friendly service, and offers a large variety of ice creams, cakes, and drinks at very reasonable prices. Personally, I think their Cappuccino Blast is the best coffee in the world. It's perfectly sweet and creamy, but still has that delicious coffee flavor underneath. It's great for kids and families, and is open late, for those who crave something sweet long after dinnertime has passed. Their ice creams are also very unique and they always have something new to offer. I suggest sampling their flavor of the month. It's always pleasantly surprising.
