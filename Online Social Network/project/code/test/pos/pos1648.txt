This was my first Yelp Elite Event and it was so much fun!  Thanks Hilary, what a great venue.

It was a gorgeous evening out on the deck.  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, even pulling out the coveted mexican mask and letting us pose for photos.

The chimichangas were very good, particularly the chorizo.  The salsa and guac were very tasty, seasoned just right.  I also enjoyed the mole chicken wings, they were a bit different than the traditional ones I have had in the past.   I really enjoyed the sweet flavor.

I look forward to returning to sample some other items on the menu.
