Came back for another couple days south. Stayed at the Hyatt again between a visit to the Birch and the next day's ride through Julian and Palomar.

My riding buddy was stuck in Carlsbad for the day and would join me later in the evening. I rode down with another friend and after the aquarium, we came to Michael's for some rest, conversation, and lunch.

Buffalo wings were standard for the Hyatt kitchen and so was the burger. 

Wings were large and had nice spice to them as usual. 

Burger was juicy and cooked to order with avocado and bacon added. Jack cheese was good and didn't turn to plastic at room temperature. Bacon was thick sliced and cooked just right. Produce was all fresh. Bread was soft and warm.

We sat outdoors on the patio with the unlit fire place. It would have been ice to have some warmth since the day was a bit cold.

Service wasn't as friendly as my previous visit hence the deleted star, but it was prompt so that counts for something.

Hyatt food is Hyatt food, but it's nice to know that just across the way from Valet is Fleming's, Japengo, Truluck, and Melting Pot (which is disgusting).

After a couple pints of Guinness (yes, I drank), it was time for a nap.

I've been here on a few occasions with a few people and this place is starting to growing on me. I can easily see myself stopping in when I'm either riding through or staying overnight.

Thanks, Michael's for taking good care of my friends and I.
