I was blown away by this oasis of fantastic flavor.  The grilled stuffed pasta was so mind-bendingly delicious that I tried to recreate this at home.  While the description and use of two sauces sounds like it would contradict itself, each of the components blend marvelously in your mouth.

I sampled soups and small bites as well.  Over all, I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don't compete for attention.  There is a certain finesse that's being used in the kitchen to render distinctly memorable flavor profiles.  

The atmosphere was inviting, modern and clean.  The service staff knowledgeable and attentive.  I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again.
