When searching for restaurants for our Boston vacation, I happened upon Craigie on Main, and when I saw that they serve fried pigs' tails, I was sold. I read Little House in the Big Woods as a kid, and was always intrigued by the scene where Laura's father roasts the pig's tail for her and Mary. She just made it sound so fucking delicious. Here was my chance to finally try it!

Craigie did not disappoint, and neither did the pigs' tails. They were probably the best part of the meal (I was so attached to the idea of them that I ordered them *in addition to* the eight-course tasting menu -- probably a mistake, as you'll find out later), but not by much! All eight courses ranged from very very tasty (the house-made corkscrew pasta) to "holy shit I'm dying of delicious" (the sashimi with harissa). It was all a bit too much for me, though -- after the 5th course, I ended up having to tell our server to box the rest, as I was beyond stuffed. I managed to save room for a bite of the apricot-marzipan pie, though, which was pretty divine.

Overall, a worthy choice for fine dining in the Boston area. I'm really glad we went here and I'd definitely go back, for the pigs' tails alone!
