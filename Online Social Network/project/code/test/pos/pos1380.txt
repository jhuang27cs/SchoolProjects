Note: if there was no "cross contamination," they wouldn't be using the grill and utensils correctly. 

It's not Philly, but if you hold the peppers you'll get a proper experience of Brotherly Love. Sit at the counter and watch those spatulas work the meat. The Niman Ranch meat changes the traditonal texture (there is a risk of gristle with that kind of meat), but it's still correctly gooey and served on the right kind of roll. 

Good job
