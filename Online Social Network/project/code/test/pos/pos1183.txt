This is a great place for burgers, but you don't have to settle for beef!  There must be twenty different ways that they'll put one together for you, and you can choose from beef, veggie, black bean, ostrich, bison, and maybe a few more.  The tots and salads are great, too.
  The decor is a bit overwhelming, with the biker-skeleton-boobs motif in high gear.  But if you dig the place's attitude, you'll love it.  The staff is very friendly if you are.  The drink selection is way above average, and the customers are more interesting to chat with than at most local spots.  See you there!
