So happy to have found this place!

Excellent and unique mixed drinks.   Food is top notch.  Service could not have been better.  Bartender was very personable and knowledgeable, as was our waiter. 
 
Our dinner was outstanding.   Fresh, local food (where available) and they try to use sustainable fish, etc.   Especially like that they switch their menu around frequently.    

Love the chef's table.  Will be trying that out for an anniversary or birthday celebration.
