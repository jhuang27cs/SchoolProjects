Soooo wonderful!  

My favorites (among vegan things) 

- Beer battered tofu (the batter reminds me a little of funnel cake, which is a little odd at first -- but the tofu is firm, the caper dill aioli gives a fresh bright flavor, the red cabbage slaw is totally un-coleslawy and healthy)
- Tofu eggs benedict (roasted tomato is great); the tofu eggs are not at all egglike, of course, but tasty:  I think they're made of tofu, chickpea flour, and turmeric) 
- The River Street (veganized) 
- Onion rings (so big! such sweet onions!) 
- The cherry cheesecake

Not quite as awesome: 

- Open-face seitan sandwich (the baked beans are too sweet for my tastes)
- Rye bread -- can't taste anything but caraway. In general, would be nice if their breads were a little more artisanal

It seems like they're constantly improving!  The homefries recently have been bigger -- a nice improvement. And I used to have difficulty keeping my coat on the seats in the high booths; but they recently got coat racks by each of the booths!  If it keeps up this pace, Veggie Galaxy will soon be the best restaurant in the US.
