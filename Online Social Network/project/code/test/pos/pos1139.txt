Molly is the best!!!  She is very knowledgable about different kinds of curly hair and the best way to care for it and what products to use.  I recently moved to Pasadena and the air is much dryer than what I am used to so I've been having some issues with that.  Molly knew just what to recommend and did a great job with my cut!  Also she is incredibly sweet and patient.  I will definitely be returning to Orpheum.  Plus there is plenty of 2 hour street parking and they will validate for the lot next door.  Thank you for my new look!
