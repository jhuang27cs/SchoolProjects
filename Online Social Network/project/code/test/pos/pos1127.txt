A neo-rustic ware-house bistro,  chic in presentation and attitude. The food borders on good to really good. service good to fair. They put real butter in the pasta and they don't skimp on portions. Plan on spending one hundred dollars for two people. Drink some Italian wine to make the experience better. You're sitting on the border of housing projects and Bio-Techs. Hmmm. Outpost?. Almost.
