I come here to get natural nut butters and other organic foods that are not exactly ubiquitous in your everyday supermarket.  The store itself is small but has a good, wide range of fresh produce and meats, along with all-natural snacks, like freeze-dried coconut (one of my favorite snacks).  The service is spectacular and they have Bent Spoon ice cream.  This is a must-try for all vegetarians and vegans, since they have a lot of different lentils and grains, along with soy-based products like seitan and tempeh.
