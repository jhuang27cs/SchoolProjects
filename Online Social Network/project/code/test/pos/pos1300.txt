Delicious!!!! Yum Yum Yum!  Way better than any other pizza spot I know of.  Slices are not only big, but theyre thick!! The only thing i dont like about this place is the nastiness of the seating area.  But, its cool, i can stand and eat, or make sure the wax paper stuff is blocking the germs on the table!  This pizza brings back some nostalgia from my childhood...its that good!  however, i think the slices used to be bigger...maybe i was just little then.  wutever, ITS YUMMY!!! TRY IT!
