Have you ever thought a sandwich shop in a train station can be any good? I didn't and I was so wrong.

I randomly ordered a "prosciutto, fresh mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and pesto, some fancy name" panini sandwich because I was hungry and needed something to kill time on the boring one-hour train ride up to Boston. Let me tell you, their sandwiches are out of this world! They use fresh focaccia bread and I noticed they drizzled the sandwich with extra virgin olive oil before sending them on the grill! If you close your eyes and indulge that sandwich, you will quickly forget you are at a train station! It's amazingly fresh and tasty.

I notice the sign "Seven Stars Bakery" on their counter so maybe they use bread from Seven Stars? If that's really what they're doing -- GENIUS! (see my review for Seven Stars...)

The only drawback is good sandwiches take time to make. If you go few minutes before the train leaves, like me, you will surely be in a rush or might miss the train. I waited about 10-15 mins for them to make my delicioso. Usually 10-15 mins is no big deal at a restaurant but it's totally different when you have to catch a train. If you want a sandwich from there, give yourself few extra minutes for this heavenly sandwich. You will not regret it.
