Incredibly pleasant experience adopting a cat!  Everyone we dealt with was friendly and passionate about finding good homes for their foster cats.  We visited 3 kittens before we found the perfect match... and it was worth it!  All their cats are spayed/neutered, have their shots, and they even include free exams with local vets.  It's a very well-run and caring organization.
