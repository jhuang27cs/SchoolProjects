One of THEE best thai foods I've EVER tried in my life! I ordered my favorite dish, panang! It had squash and chicken in it. It was like heaven in my mouth and the rice really balances out the sweetness! My friends ordered pad Thai and patseeyoo. It was both delicious, but I have to say the patseeyoo had a very smoky grill taste which I really liked and the pad Thai had more of a sour acidic taste which was interesting as well. I definitely would like to go back since I only went once! Oh! And service is pretty good but it was hard trying to get their attention. It gets pretty busy and it's pretty small and cramped. But some of the decor was really weird.
