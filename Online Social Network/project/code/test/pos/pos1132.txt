Not only is Pyara my favorite Boston area spa and salon, it was the first spa I went to in the area.  I've since tried some other high-end places on Newbury and the like, and have never received treatment that surpassed my experience here.  Sure it is pricey for a salon, but as far as good full-service spas go, the prices are reasonable.  The facials there are extremely relaxing and effective.  I never feel like my face is congested or goopy upon leaving, just soft and refreshed.  The products smell excellent.   The massages I had were very comfortable; heated table, just the right amount of music, good decor, and of course, skilled hands.  I've had several haircuts and colorings there by senior and junior stylists alike, and each has had a unique and effective style for my (sometimes pesky) wavy and thick hair (though I will say that if you don't have a preference, go with a junior stylist and save some cash).

I think a nice thing about the vibe in Pyara is that it fits Harvard Square well.  Though it's a relatively nice spa, the receptionists, hairdressers and aestheticians all have an alternative and often punk-rock sensibility.  There is nothing stuffy about Pyara (or Aveda salons in general, it seems).  They are down to earth, no pun intended.  They are knowledgeable and will recommend products they've used on you at the end of your visit but it's not high pressure.

The only downside to Pyara is that it can be tough to get an appointment when you want one.  I think it's wonderful that they are opening another spa and salon in Burlington this fall, with extended services.  I'm sure it will get plenty of business if it's anything like Pyara Harvard Square.  Plus, finally, I'll be able to park my car and not fret during my relaxation time about feeding the meters.
