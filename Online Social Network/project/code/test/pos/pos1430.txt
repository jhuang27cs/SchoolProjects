Soo delicious! Nearly a perfect pizza. Doughy and flavorful with a tasty sweet sauce. I've only ordered delivery and it's always been buy one get one free, which makes it a pretty incredible value. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because delivery takes at least an hour, even close by. So order early!
