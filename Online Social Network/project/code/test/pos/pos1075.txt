Love This Place! I can't be sure what is better at this place the food or the friendly staff! Admittedly I was slightly intimidated at first because of the neighborhood it was located in, but the staff and manager/boss made me feel right and home instantly. I got the Figueroa Philly with American Cheese and shared it with a friend. It came out to 9.40 with onion rings and a drink, but the sandwich was so big! I walked out stuffed with having spent less than $5 a person! I am definitely planning on going back and bringing a few friends in tow!
