I have a problem with Geoff's.  

The problem is that I have been going there since about 1975. So I am admittedly trapped in a time warp as far as this place goes. In that time, there have been a lot of changes but the core experience remains... a unique space, with good food, great variety and value, served up by this decade's crop of Brown/RISDI stoners.  

But for a geyser like me, it is hard to not think back to the times when it was new, totally different and a local novelty.

In the early years, the portions were enormous... a half pound of meat. Not Carnegie Deli, mind you, but pretty substantial. Somewhere along the way, economics took over.  They started to offer full (8 oz) and half orders (4 oz). In recent years, seems like the 1/2 order option became the full order norm. Just seems a bit skimpy. But I guess that's how you keep the sandwiches under $10.

On the plus side, the new generation of help is friendlier and more..well... helpful.  Back in the day, they'd scream at you, make fun of you to your face and hit on your girlfriend.  I never saw the charm in that.

And in spite of my portion peeve, the freshness of the food, variety of selection and "build your own" options continue to bring me back.

Now a word of advise.  

Geoff's was not put on this earth to purvey veggie-sprout-hummus fare.  I know its healthy and I know its better for the cattle.  But its boring.  

Geoff's "raison d'etre" is to provide the experience of piping hot bologna and melted Swiss cheese grease running down your forearms.  Get your butt in there and order a triple meat anything.. melt some gooey cheese on it.. load it up with Shedd's and russian dressing and grab 50 napkins and a pickle.

Only then shall ye know the truth.
