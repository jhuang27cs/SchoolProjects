The hardest thing about getting here was finding parking, even on a weekday. so after finding a space in a dark alley (and also searching for a parking space for a friend), i was thinking this place better be damn good. i once again was lured here by recommendations from fellow yelper Peter Y. He said the Sublime Burger was a must-try...he had me at "donut". what can i say? I luv sugar and dough. 
When the burger came, it was tastefully presented w/ pickle slices on top...never would've guessed it was a donut bun if i wasn't told before-hand. i would've thought it was a bagel. the taste was quite sensational...sweet and salty all in one bite. and the bacon, oh the bacon. and it was just juicy/greasy enough. the only thing i wished was that the burger meat be in thinner patties..kinda like at holeman and finch...but they don't have sublime donuts there! We also ordered some sliders: meatballs and cod. everyone loved the meatballs, but i really liked the lightness of the cod (well, i'd like to think tartar sauce can be light:) all in all, a really cool hang-out. good food and spirits. i'm hoping to check out the actual sublime donut joint soon...
