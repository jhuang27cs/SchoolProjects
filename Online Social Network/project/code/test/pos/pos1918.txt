Fabulous wine shop! I love this place :) 

Eric, the shop manager, and all other staff are very knowledgeable and friendly when it comes to wine selection and knowing about prominent wine producing regions internationally. Nobu, the owner, is such a doll and very down to earth (psst: he's opening Harlem's first sushi/wine bar in June!). 

**They have free wine tastings on Fri. evenings from 5:30 - 8:30 p.m. It was bustling last Fri. when I went and event a place to meet a new 'friend' lol.
