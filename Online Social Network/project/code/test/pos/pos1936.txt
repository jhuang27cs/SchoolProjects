Stopped by here once with a few friends and tried the shrimp burrito.

For the price, portion size is decent, nothing spectacular.

The quality of the food however was pretty good, the shrimp burrito was very good, the fruity pineapple salsa was very unique, sweet tangy and a great compliment to the grilled shrimp (probably not authentic, but good none-the-less). 

There was also complementary chips and salsa available. 

The service was quick, though the time we went was not too busy. 

Overall, the food is decent for a college burrito joint and a establishment that I will come back to when visiting friends at UC Berkeley.
