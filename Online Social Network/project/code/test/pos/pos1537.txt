I've been to 622 North around 20 times since they opened in the former Bogen's Steakhouse.  I've explored almost the entire dinner menu, and haven't had a bad experience yet.  The pizzas are a highlight, but the salads, burgers, pastas, and meat cuts are all great, too.  My lady enjoys occasionally coming here after work for appetizers and drinks (favorites include the spinach-artichoke dip and potato rounds).  They have a great wine selection, and a rotating choice of high-quality beer (draft and bottled).  Service is the best and most professional in Blacksburg (which isn't saying much, but is still worth saying).  

622 North started serving weekend brunch a few months ago, and it's already a winner.  While the eggs benedict was surprisingly bland and tough, everything else I've tried (e.g. omelets, biscuits and gravy, the enormous "pancake club") has been great.  They also serve the best bloody mary in town.

We'll be back!
