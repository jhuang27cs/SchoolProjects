Fantastic.  My wife and I have been wanting to go here for a while, and last night we finally got around to going.  We had a great table in the corner, affording us a view of the open kitchen as well as all the other tables.  The wait staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  And of course, the food was out of this world.  We had the 6-course tasting dinner, consisting of 2 seafoods, 1 soup, 1 vegetable, 1 meat, and dessert.  The absolute standout of the evening was the spring onion soup with a grilled cheese sandwich made with cheese from Borough Market in London (which we had just visited in January).  The soup was creamy and tasted just like spring should taste, and the sandwich was quite possibly the most perfect grilled cheese sandwich in existence.  Also fantastic was the yellowtail tuna over avocado and the lamb trifecta - loin, tongue, and sweetbreads.  I would heartily recommend CoM to anybody who loves food.
