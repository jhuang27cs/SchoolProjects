Suan la chow show! If you are at Mary's you must, I repeat must, get this. It is a "soup" starter, whatever you want to call it.. but spicy broth with delicious wontons over bean sprouts. It's a party in a bowl! Then, "make way for dumplings" as they say. The small steamed buns are fantastic and come with a great ginger sauce to accompany it. If you are ordering scallion pie or the peking ravioli it comes with a spicy sauce, ask for hot oil and mix some in generously then dip away! Thank me later. You may gain a few pounds here but you may also sweat it out haha. Mongolian beef is also top-notch and the dun-dun noodles are great although I always forget to order them myself..

I order the same thing all the time so this review is pretty much based on only 5-6 items. If you are looking for more americanized chinese food or super-authentic dim sum this is not the spot. 

Mary is usually here and when she has an apron on you know you're in for a treat! Very friendly staff and great eats on the cheap. Can't beat that!
