I have been to several acupuncturist, but keep going back to David. I have had Multiple Sclerosis since 1996. He has treated me with both needles and herbs. Very knowledgeable about the body, diet  and how the seasons affect ones health.  Great guy and easy to talk with. If you are unsure of the treatment he is giving you, just ask him what it is all about.
