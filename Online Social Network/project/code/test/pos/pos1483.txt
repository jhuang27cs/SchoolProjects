I must say i love Ike's! I find this one the best out of the bunch i drive from Belmont to go to the stanford location. Yes i know theres one in redwood city but it just doesn't taste the same, not to mention the parking there sucks. I bring all my friends here and chow down on there delicious sandwiches pure heaven in your month experience. The only reason this place gets a 4 out of 5 is there hours on the weekend they used to close at 5:30 but now close at 3!? why i dont understand its always busy here i guess ike doesn't like money too bad.
