i don't review hotels but this one was my second home for about 4 years. i wonder if kenny the bartender is still there....

i used to arrive late after the kitchen closed but kenny would go and rustle me up a soup or a burger....

they let me keep my work boots at the hotel so i didn't have to lug them across the country every time...

for breakfast the morning maitre'd handed me my paper and let me sit at the bar alone and the waiter would bring me my fruit smoothie and tea while i read the paper.  no words, just the signature on the room number.

when the lakers were playing, they kicked out the celtics fans so i can watch in peace.

really, need i say more?
