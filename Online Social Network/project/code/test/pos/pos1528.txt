The Blanton art museum is  museum with lots of great art.

 If you have any kids, bring them! This is a kid friendly place, and on Summer Fridays, they even have story time! at story time, they walk around the museum, look at the pictures, talk about the art, and read stories related to the art. one of the days we went there, upstairs was a lady who had paper, crayons, and origami.

 On the upper floor, they have visiting exhibits, and right now April 28 - October 14, they have the wild west exhibit. also on the upper floor, there is a room full of Pennies, all minted in 1995, in the back. In the penny room my baby brother and I did half snow angels, until somebody told us we're not supposed to.
