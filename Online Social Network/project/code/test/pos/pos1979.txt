I haven't tried the pizza or calzones here, just the pasta. Cinderella's is a great answer to the post-work munchies at midnight, especially when you're too tired to deal with a noisy bar scene. Their service seems to be standard and the prices are reasonable, especially for the area. I really like their garlic bread (yes, it's extra-garlic-y) and the option to "make your own" pasta. My only complaint is that both times the sauce came out a bit too much like soup and I found myself wishing for a spoon. Altogether it's a reasonable deal for decent, filling food.
One warning: try to show up before 12:30 if you want to sit and eat. I've seen the waitstaff tell people "only takeout" after that point.
