When you walk up to the counter, the first thing you'll notice is that big stick of meat, with its juices glistening and begging you to eat it. 

The chicken their is really great, that's all I eat there. The skin is crispy and the meat is juicy, not dry. Its more worth it to get the whole chicken, roughly 9 bucks. The half is almost 7, so for 2 dollars more, why not get the other half of the chicken. No need for the other side stuff. 

As for decor, there really isn't any. But then again, you don't go to these places cause it looks nice. You just go for the food.
