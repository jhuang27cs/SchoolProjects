This is a cool little place to eat at. I got the dumpling soup for lunch. The dumplings were alright. They looked like they were the frozen kinds you get from the store. The soup was so delicious though! Mmm... 
I noticed that other places with the same food cost a few dollars less than this place, but I don't know about the quality of their food so... eh.
