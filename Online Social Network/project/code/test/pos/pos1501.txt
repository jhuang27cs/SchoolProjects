LOVE this place, and not just because it has tons of vegetarian items. The people are friendly, the portions are huge (almost to a fault) and they give you wonderfully decadent fried pita chips with self-serve olive tapenade and spicy red sauce. I don't know WHAT is in that red sauce, but I can't get enough of it.

I love that the vegetarian combo is a nice balance of flavors and texture and includes plenty of protein:  beans, rice, green salad, babaghanoush (which is the best I've found in Pasadena -- nice and smoky), hummus and grape leaves. Oh, and pita bread. And pita chips. I usually have to share a plate because it's too much food, and it all tastes very fresh. 

The green bean stew (also with rice and beans and salad) is a hearty and satisfying meal for when you really don't want another falafel or bowl of hummus at a Mediterranean restaurant.

I only wish this place was a bit more comfortable. They've tried to dress up the interior a bit, but the tables and chairs are very cafeteria-like and uncomfortable, and the restaurant is not at all cozy, especially in winter. 

As for the parking, it's all on the street. I rarely have a problem finding a spot, even during the lunch rush hours, but you may have to walk a block or two. But after a big meal like that, you'll be glad for the exercise!
