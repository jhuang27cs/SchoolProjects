This was my second trip to Raven Grill. For dinner, my friend and I had Thursday's  special, seafood chile rellenos. If we had realized the chile was going to be so large, we would have shared one. I substituted grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes for the rice and beans. It was very good and I ate the leftovers cold the next day. Still good! Warning--we had originally come here the night before (Wed.) around 8:00, and we ran into a big traffic jam in the small parking lot. We got impatient and went elsewhere. So Thursday, I was there by 6:45 and had no problem.
