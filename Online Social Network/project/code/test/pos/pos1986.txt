Let me put it this way.. Shadia fixed my frizzy trying to go light red then turned orange hair.. I am a fan. I definitely goofed when I tried to do it myself but Shadia was there to fix my stupid mistake. And plus I loved the color she dyed it to and my hair cut was totally cute.

But.. I went back a few months later because the hair cut had grown out and I wanted a trim. Shadia wasn't feeling too well so I got one of the other ladies who work there. And I should have come back when Shadia was available because I absolutely -hated- the hair cut. Not only was the girl who cut my hair absolutely annoying and a busybody; it seemed like she didn't even know what the heck she was doing. I normally walk out of a hair cut feeling cute and alive.. but I walked out feeling like I wanted to cry. I've been pinning my bangs back ever since because they were too short and weren't side swept at all. They were straight! Ugh!  

4 stars for Shadia.
-1 for the annoying busybody who doesn't know how to cut hair.
