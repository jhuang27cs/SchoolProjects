My husband and I ate here two weekend's in a row, for my birthday and for mother's day. 

The brunch is wonderful! The bread budding and the flan are too die for and I don't like either, but my husband convinced me the first time we were there to try both, I did and the rest as they say is history. The stuffed jalapenos with shrimp and cheese are so good and just a tad bit hot, well they are jalapenos. I loved the corn enchiladas and the migas. 

Seco's is small and cozy and to me that is what makes this place interesting. 

We have not had any problems with the staff who were friendly and helpful or parking in the two times that we have been there. 

I have recommended Seco's to my coworkers and to our neighbors. Reservations are highly recommended.
