A tasty little hole-in-the wall I wish I had discovered earlier.  

Pros: yummy wowshis, basturma! wowshis (as an armo this is a huge victory), all-you-can eat toppings bar (pickles, spicy sauces, hummus: how can you go wrong?), real sugar coca-colas, fried cauliflower, late-night hours

Cons: abysmal seating (use the in-n-out patio if the counter's full), expensive pitas (go for the wowshis instead!), so-so falafels

Verdict: great mediterranean food in a pinch
