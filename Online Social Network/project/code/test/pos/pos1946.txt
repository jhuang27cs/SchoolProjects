I was REALLY surprised by this place.  Usually celebrity-owned establishments, well, suck, but Strait's was delicious.  The boyfriend and I ended up here on a whim for his birthday.  He lives like 3 blocks from this place, so location was a key factor.  

We stuck to the small plates options and ordered the kungo pao chicken, the shrimp wontons and the calamari.  I HATE seafood, but the stuff was pretty damn tasty.  

The service was superb and we were taken care of from the moment we walked in the door to the time we left.  

The drinks are strong!

I like it!  Good job Ludacris!
