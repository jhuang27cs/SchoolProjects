I can only comment on the breakfast buffet, served Monday-Saturday for only $4.99. Don't set your expectations too high because you are getting what you paid for. There's always an array of fresh fruit, salads and baked goods. 

The hot table generally serves kebabs, rice, beans, two scrambled dishes, sausage, bacon and french toast. Ideally, you're there when the items are freshly replenished. 

The staff always recognizes you and second guess your needs. The regulars engage you in their conversation, whether it be politics, family issues, or vacation destinations. 

There's sidewalk seating, and the inside has an open roof outdoor feel. This is the quintessential local hangout that is perfect for reading the morning newspaper.
