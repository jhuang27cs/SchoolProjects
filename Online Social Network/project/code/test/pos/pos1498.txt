Happy hour here is where it's at.  6-8PM Mon-Fri.  2.50 beers, 1 dollar off the much aforementioned burgers, and good wifi.

The hawaiian chicken burger (6 dollars after happy hour discount) and the blue moon white (wait, for 2.50? sweet!) were both great, the wifi was a little confusing but great once I figured it out (use the rocknrollgrill network with no caps!), and the lady was super nice.  The burger came with fries, and those were pretty good too. 

I'm coming back and bringing my posse.  Don't worry, we're nerds, you can probably take our turf if you want.
