FIVE STARS FOR FOOD AND SERVICE, 
I only give this four stars only because when it is over-crowded, the ambience loses its charm.
GREAT FOR GROUPS!
Food is SO good, SO authentic and SO affordable. The first time we got the check, we literally asked the server if they made a mistake (in our favor.) We couldnt believe how cheap it was. 
Love the ingera bread (spelling?)- it is so healthy, also!
Get the platter for 2 if you go..and start with those afiza lentils..I have never tried a dessert there.
Wines by the glass are a bit weak, go for a beer.
This place is great for delivery as well when you have a great bottle of wine at home.
