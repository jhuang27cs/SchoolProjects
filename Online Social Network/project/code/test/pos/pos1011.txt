So far Cedars, tucked between Brooklyn and University Way, on 43rd is king of falafel on The Ave. 

How do I know this? Well... Because just yesterday I wanted falafel for dinner and I was in university district. Where did I go after thinking over my choices?(disclaimer- I have tried every place on The Ave once in the last few months)= Cedar's walk up takeout window! 

The kind owner? has prepared my falafel in front of me each time. He warms the thin round- fills the bottom with fresh cut lettuce- sprinkles chopped fresh tomato on top- add 3-4 LARGE fresh falafel balls- pours on the dressing out of a old school juice container- and rolls the creation into a burrito like entree. My sandwich was $4 with tax. 

I like Cedars because they have flavorful large slightly crusty outside and very moist inside falafel balls. I like Cedars because they add lots of lettuce and tomato. I like Cedars because no matter how much sauce he add to the top(to my horror) I never really taste that much and it all ends up at the bottom. 

FYI's~ 
* There is also an inside the tiny shop with a couple tables
* They offer the traditional eggplant "sandwiches" 
* They offer sandwiches of fool madaras- which I learned was fava beans or another been cocked in a madaras sauce- yum! 
* A "sandwich" is a burrito style wrap of sorts 
* The bread they use(wrap, pita, etc) is on the thinner side- not like overwhelming pita 
* They menu also offers lentil soup and platters of things usual in their sandwiches with pita for dipping
