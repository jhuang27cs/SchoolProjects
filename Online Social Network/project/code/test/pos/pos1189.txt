Must know: Everyone comes here for the pad thai! Or so I heard. 

This place is great for college students. I go to UT Austin and live 5 minutes from this place. The only thing I get from here every time is the chicken pad thai. I have tried pad thai from various places in austin but this is my favorite place to go.

Meal: Seated immediately. I placed my order as soon as I sat down. I don't even need to look at the menu anymore. Pad thai was great. Very flavorful.

Overall: I hate to admit but I eat here almost every week. It's too good!
