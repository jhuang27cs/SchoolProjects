I went in here for curry one time and noticed people carrying take out from the back. I ask them it they cater and found out that there is a restaurant in the back. I figure it couldn't be too bad if people are taking it home for dinner. So I ordered goat curry, chicken curry, naan and rice. This is probably one of the better indian food I had since I move here, and I have been looking. 

In the front next to the register, there is a tray of somoser and those fried vegie thingie. The somoser are huge and gooooood!  Dip it in the curry source and it is heaven.
