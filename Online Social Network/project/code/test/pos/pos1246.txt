I had just not went to Jolly Pumpkin since they opened because, Ann Arbor has so many breweries that I didn't believe it could be anything that new! After our first experience I was so impressed that we went back three days later! The beer I knew would be great but I was really impressed by the food. 

 ~ we had pizza on both occasions the spicy the first time and meat the second. Both were great but I really loved the spicy one it was perfecly balanced. 

 ~ The truffled fries we had both times and they were great the second time we had to fight my five year old daughter for them! She wanted to eat the garlic mayo that came with them by itself!

~ On the second visit we also had the noodle salad which was light and delicous you just need to make sure you mix it up completley because the tofu sucked up all the dressing. My daughter also had their basic burger and really dug it.

Both times the service was top notch. the second time we were there they were obviously busy but our server managed to keep up just fine. The first time we were later so they were a little slower and we had some questions on merchandise and our server went above and beyond, She was just great! 

We will defintley be back soon!
