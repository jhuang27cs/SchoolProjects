Without a doubt, the best farmers market I've ever been to in the US. The variety of items available is almost overwhelming--I always buy more than I've planned to. And the quality is excellent. Love talking to the vendors, who will gladly give you hints on how to store and prepare a produce item you've never used before. And wandering the stalls is such a pleasure--the smells, the beautiful piles of fruits and vegetables.

We are so lucky to have this market!
