I'm going to be honest and up front with all of you...99.9% of the time I've had Insomnia Cookies I have been extremely inebriated, had the munchies, or a combo of both. With that being said, trust me when I say that there is no better late night delivery place than Insomina Cookies, especially if you have a craving for something sweet. They definitely are not on par with "authentic bakeries" (their cookies and brownies are all cooked after being pre frozen) but "authentic bakeries" won't deliver you an ewie gooey mess of chocolate paradise at 2:30AM, so you learn to deal with it. The price is just right at $1.25 a cookie and $1.50 a brownie (plus 25 cents extra for each topping) and if you are feeling especially hungry, or have friends who are also in the mood for sweets, they have many bulk specials which lower the price to under a buck a cookie.

What else can I say, diabetes has never tasted so good!
