Sunday Brunch is probably my favorite meal of the week, and after moving to a new city I was excited about finding new brunch spots to try out. A friend recommended Benjy's to me and I have fallen in love with this cute little restaurant! 
The menu changes every couple months, which I love about the place, because you know the food will be freshed and the chef is being inspired by what's available in season and not just sticking to old recipes that have been on the menu for ages and lose their sparkle.
Between my friends and I we tried out their seasonal french toast , crab cakes and eggs. The french toast was made with freshly baked brioch and served up with a fruit reduction and mango salsa. The crabcakes were deliciously plump, meaty and perfectly pan seared with a side of fresh fruits. The portions were rather large, none of us were able to finish our plates..but that's not really something to complain about is it. And the price was just right! 
I would definitely recommend going back atleast once every two months so you can try out the latest on the menu.
