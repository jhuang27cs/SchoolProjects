Fabulous restaurant, plain and simply.

The food is fantastic.  My first experience with Dogwood was my partners birthday dinner about 3 years ago, and since then I have probably eaten there 5 or 6 times.  The atmosphere is lovely, classy and comfortable.  The wait staff are very professional and attentive.

One of my favorite appetizers is the grits buffet, its hard to describe, but simply delectable.  I call their food...Southern fusion (maybe that's what they call it too).  I mean, southern food is either good or horrible, there is not much in between, but Dogwood puts such a pleasant and elegant spin on traditional dishes...plus they add a very nice splash of flair.

I highly recommend Dogwood before an evening of theatre at the Fox or for any special occasion, or just for a nice romantic dinner.
