I love hawaiian bbq and saw L&L when I was researching for quick places to eat.
I have eaten here a few times since its close to some of the hotels.

As people mentioned it easy in and out take out.  The quality of the food is so-so because the few times I ordered chicken or beef ribs, it had fat pieces in there.
Reason why I ranked it high was the marinated chicken and mac salad.  Very hard to duplicate.

If you have ever tried hawaiian bbq at other placese its very similar and hard to find similar food that tastes "hawaiian"  It does help satisfy your craving for hawaiian food.
