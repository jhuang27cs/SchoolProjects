As with most used/vintage/second-hand/whatever stores, it's difficult to come across anything truly spectacular, but it can definitely be done.  At $3.99, I think it's worth it to look around, especially since most of their not-so-fashionable garments hold a very desirable quality: potential.  If you're crafty and things you can alter those ugly dresses into cute ones and then you'll be the hippest kid in town in your one-of-a-kind threads and it won't break the bank.  Or they might also be really great for something like an ugly dress dance party.

They have this stack of and/or a rack filled with t-shirts with weird slogans and designs on them.  I'm not really sure what most of them mean but I think they're mistranslations or maybe that's just part of their charm, unless there's a whole underground culture of grammatically incorrect clubs that sell their t-shirts here.  Either way, they're pretty exciting.
