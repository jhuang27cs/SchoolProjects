I don't usually have an urge to see pictures of siamese twins that have been dissected after they die, but when I do, I come here.  

It's a really great date location for that quirky, medical-oddity loving girl in your life.  It's got all sorts of very weird, very cool exhibits, and when we went on Valentine's Day, it was fucking packed.  It does take a long time to make it through the museum if it's busy, so budget a few hours.
