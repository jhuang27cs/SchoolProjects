We built a new house last year, which included a fancy schmancy front door with impossible keys to duplicate (and the manufacturer only gave us 2 keys).  Being a family of 4, I have been going around to our nearby hardware stores to try and get a real, not live, but working set of duplicate keys made to no avail.

I have been to UVillage a billion times and hadn't used Lee's Keys and Locks until today.  After 4+ months of getting sets of duplicate keys made that do not work at all (but I still had to pay for), I popped by Lee's and asked for duplicate keys despite the "No Refunds" sign like the various other key cutters.  The difference (other than the delta of ~+$4/key) is that Lee's Keys actually work.  Sorry, Yelpers, for doubting your legitness.  

Lee's Keys is so money, but he probably does know it.
