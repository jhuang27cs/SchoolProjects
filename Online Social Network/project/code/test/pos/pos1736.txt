This isn't a place you go to for atmosphere, this is the place you go to for awesome pie and great burgers. Walking in IS a flashback to some bygone era--the decor is very dated and has seen better days. BUT, look past that, sit down at a table, order some boysenberry pie and with your first bite you're transfered back to grandma's kitchen. 

The pies are the most like homemade I've ever had at a restaurant. This isn't the Marie Calendar's style of pie, which is mass produced for consistency and loaded with sugar and preservatives. This is all-natural bliss. The pecan pie was my absolute favorite. Most pecan pies I've had at restaurants/bakeries are so sugary sweet they almost hurt your teeth to eat them and practically put you into a sugar coma. This one was not like that, it tasted like good homemade pecan pies I've had before. The boysenberry was also awe-inspiring. 

We also got the burgers, my friend had a regular cheeseburger and I had a veggie burger. Both were very delicious! Again, these had the flavor of good, old-fashioned, homemade burgers. The buns were wonderfully soft and the toppings were tasty. I don't see how these can be compared with Inn-N-Out burgers because they're so different. Both are enjoyable, but you have them for different reasons according to what kind of taste you're in the mood for.

CONCLUSION: Wonderful place to go to for old-fashioned, homemade burgers and pies. Definitely worth experiencing and a place I will go back to again!
