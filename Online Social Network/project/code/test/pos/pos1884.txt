Rhode Island Red's is one of the few places in the College Park area that I really feel good about eating at.  It's a privately owned cafe with daily specials, a comfortable atmosphere and a really friendly environment.  I got the pepperoni pizza, sensible green salad and a single espresso.  The pizza was thin crust, delicious and crispy.  The salad was chopped with high quality ingredients with a light, but delicious dressing.

Rhode Island Red's is one of those places that really seems to care about quality of food.  The food isn't churned out assembly line style, but maticulously prepared by the owned with the customer in mind.  He has free wi-fi (but asks you at least buy something if you're going to use it, which is certainly a fair request).

Just 10-15 minutes away from the University of Maryland, its not a far drive and certainly worth that little extra to not go to one of the chains in College Park.  Go check out Rhode Island Red's! You won't be disappointed!
