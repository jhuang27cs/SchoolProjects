I'm not sure having issues with Harvard square is in any way related to gentrification, though I certainly belong to that generation for whom it is "cool" to hate on gentrification.  Of course, we also are a huge part of that trend.

However old I am, I do still enjoy spending time in Harvard Square.  It's not the same place I remember when I was a little kid, when my parents took my brother and me here to watch a multitude of street performers in the summer and wander around the bookstore when we wanted to go inside.  There are still a few street performers, but far fewer than I remember 15 years ago.  

Wow, that made me feel old.

Sure, Harvard Square has its share of commercial chain stores like the Gap, Starbucks, and Qdoba, but plenty of other chains are local (i.e. Le's, The Tannery, and Second Time Around), and there seems to also be an influx of new locally owned stores and restaurants.  I'm particularly a fan of Crema Cafe.

Given that I'm a grad student at Harvard, it seems unlikely I'd stop spending time here regardless, but for coffee shops, some good food, and a few interesting stores to wander in and out of, I'm pretty satisfied anyway.
