This review will pertain to the sushi portion of the menu, as well as a testament to the customer service of the establishment.

2 mins to closing, I walk in with my brother and a couple friends of mine. Note that I hate walking into a place so close to closing, but I get cravings for sushi that have to be satiated quickly or I become grumpy. We were awkwardly greated by the mom and the dad, and were informed the sushi bar had closed. Mind you, the primary reason we came to this place was for some sushi before heading over to the highlands to meet up some buddies. We informed them that we were interested in the sushi portion of the menu, and they immediately obliged, and brought out the sushi menus even though everything had been packed up for closing. How awesome is that?!?!

There was one other table of people who were being a little loud giving the calm decor of the place, but we got to choose our seats in an otherwise empty establishment. 

It was hard to understand some of the things the mom was trying to explain regarding the specials, but her son, who was the one who prepared the sushi, came out and explained it to us. We ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll, The Eel Roll, the Bubble Gum Roll, the Spyder Roll, and 10 pieces of chefs choice nigiri which came as standard- 2 pieces of white tuna, shimp, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.

The ginger salad was nothing special, but exactly what you'd expect for ginger salad. I didn't have the miso soup but the other 3 did, and the only complaint I heard was the lack of scoopage from the soup spoons when you get close gett the bottom. Funny people.

All of the nigiri sushi was very fresh and most importantly, not salty.

The Spicy Tuna roll has more tuna than most spicy tuna rolls, which I was a huge fan of. 

I'm a big skeptic of any rolls that are fried or contain tempura, as I'm not a fan of heavy sushi. both the Spyder roll and Bubble Gum roll contained such, but were great and did not feel to heavy or greasy.

The Eel roll was not covered in eel sauce, and wasn't too salty.

We devoured every piece on the plate. Between the 4 of us for the sushi and few sweet teas, the bill was $55 without gratuity.

We left at 10:45 and they did not seem one but upset or pushy. In fact, we had to go up to the register to ask for our bill rather than them quickly giving us to check so that we could leave. 

I will undoubtedly become a regular at this new gem of a sushi spot so close to midtown.

Went back the other day to find that they no longer serve Chef's choice for the Sushi. Sadness.

 however, I did try the fried and steamed dumpling. GREAT SUCCESS!!!!
