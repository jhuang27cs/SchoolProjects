I took a class here and now I am hooked.  I was looking to get back into taking class and knew Dance Complex was going to be the winner when I saw their schedule online.  They have every kind of dance, every kind of level and no need to commit.  Come and take a class whenever you want and pay 10-12 bucks on the spot.  

When I walked in, I knew I was hooked.  Climbing the stairs, I felt like I was in the high school of performing arts from FAME!  I could hear the African Jazz Funk music and wished I could do that, too!

I took Jazz and my instructor Lisa was so great and everyone in the class was so nice (it's been a while since I took a dance class and I am out of shape for this kind of movement).  I just had the best time and am so happy to be dancing again!

Don't feel intimidated.  Everyone is welcoming and there to have a great time.  Check it out!
