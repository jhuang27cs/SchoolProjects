When I wanted to commit to self-care and begin yoga, I picked this place and am so grateful. The studio, unlike others, is smaller and has this peaceful, therapeutic sense to it. Everytime I go, I feel better afterwards. I am comfortable there, and the teachers modify the poses/class to his/her students. There are props available and personal massage touches during the class and near the end. The staff is also friendly. In general, love the place and I never feel judged by my level or appearance when I go. What more can one ask for when participating in needed self-care!
