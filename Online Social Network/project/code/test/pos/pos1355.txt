This chicken was great! I suggest calling ahead, as a few others suggested. Not that it takes super long, but about 15 mins. once you order. I got the Chicken w/ sauce (sweet and sour) the only thing I would request next time is to go a little lighter on the sauce. I will definitely be adding this to my lunch rotation.
