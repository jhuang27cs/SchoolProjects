People of Nashville...rejoice. Antico Pizza is opening a location here. I cant wait till this summer when they are up and running. After you read the reviews on this place, you will see why I am so excited. 

On a recent pit stop in the ATL, my girlfriend and I ended up at Antico on a whim. What a great last minute decision it was to make a stop here. This pizza is not your ordinary pizza, it's something sent down from the heavens. 

Oh, and before I forget to tell you, this place is BYOB. Yep, BYOB. Whatever your beer or wine of choice is, bring some with you and drink it while you nosh some some cheesy goodness. The whole idea of bringing your own booze to a restaurant, is great. No more disappointment when the dining establishment of your choosing, does not have what you want. 

Okay, now back to that cheesy good stuff. The dough really has to be the best part of this delicious package. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce, the only disappointment was that some of the basil was burnt. But, other than that, it was spot on. It was so good that the two of us ate that entire thing.
