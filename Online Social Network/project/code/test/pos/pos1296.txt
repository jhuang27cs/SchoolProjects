I go to this place at least once a week or more! It's probably one of my favorite pho places ever. I looooove pho, and this place definitely is great. They give you a lot of noodles and meat! Other pho restaurants on the ave either give you a lot of broth that's too watery and little noodles, but pho tran has a good ratio. Great price for the amount they give. I've never really tried anything else on their menu except for their pho, but the pho is worth five stars! Highly recommend this place!
