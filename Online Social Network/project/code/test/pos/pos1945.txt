I have studied at MIT and find RPI competitive but nicely distinct.
RPI's high quality and reputation will serve you well when you leave. This is a result of the highly challenging nature of the program and the quality of interactions with faculty and peers here, of course. The outstanding nature of the faculty that I knew seems well maintained.
Some housing nearby seems at first glance a little rough, but good possibilities exist for reasonable student living situations. Troy is unusual in that some extremely old, by US standards, dilapidated-appearing housing is separated from very relaxed almost rural suburban areas by only a few minutes of easy travel. Early housing searches may be especially important here, as parts of the housing stock will only appeal on a very idiosyncratic basis if at all, but students do tend to find what they want in the end. For some, the whole experience can seem excessively overwhelming at times, but for those who navigate through challenges, an important skill to practice in any case, RPI provides highly positive results in the end.
