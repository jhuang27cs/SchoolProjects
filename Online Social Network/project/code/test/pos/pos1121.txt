Paid a visit to Wagamama a couple of days ago and was nothing but impressed. Service was slightly frenetic, but I think that's likely due to the fact there was only one server on duty and well, lots of diners... I'm a vegetarian and there was  a variety of options. I ordered the Yasai Itame, which is rice noodles with veggies and tofu in a rich, wonderful coconut broth. The broth was fantastic and the bowl, though smaller than some of what I saw around me, was more than enough for a couple of meals. And it was so good that I was happy to have leftovers to dig into later.
