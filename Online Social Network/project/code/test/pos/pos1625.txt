Three words. Mango. Gummy. Bears.
SO GOOD.

Came here on a Friday night and it was not busy at all. This was probably because all the SC kids were still on winter break. I've had 21 Choices before but I think this location is top. The service was excellent and the people behind the counter were so friendly and helpful. They were nice enough to let my three friends and me try every flavor we wanted to and were even suggesting which flavors to try and which toppings to pair with the froyo. The strawberry sorbet yogurt is very tasty and refreshing!

They even gave us a free cup of the mango gummy bears!

Service is good. Quality is excellent. 
Overall, 21 Choices made me a fan and I'm looking forward to coming back if I'm ever in the area again!
