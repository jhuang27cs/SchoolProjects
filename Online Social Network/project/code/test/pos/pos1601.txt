The food is good and the yinzeritas are quite the experience - a little too fruity for my taste but others seemed to enjoy it.  You have to try it once.  

Very vegan and vegetarian friendly and the service is great.  If you don't eat meat I would recommend checking your food though as my girlfriend ordered the tofu tacos.  Three of them come in an order and one of them had chicken!  Thankfully she noticed before she had any and notified the server.  The server and manager came over and apologized profusely and gave us a free entree!  I believe the service makes up for the error and won't keep us from coming back.

I recommend sitting on the rooftop bar as it's quite nice and romantic.
