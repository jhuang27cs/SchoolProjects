I've only been here for dessert and wine.  It's a great place to bring a date. Very romantic.  Nice presentation.  I remember the desserts tasting pretty good.  Not the most out-of-this-world plate.. but not bad.

The only thing I'm not a fan of is.. the high prices for something like dessert.  So.. I guess for me, this place would only be for special occasions.
