Love this place! Who would've thought I'd be reviewing a library?

The building is so cool and modern inside. So many places to lounge, a cafe, an outdoor area to chill, and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the children's section! With toys, puzzles, and books galore. I haven't had to buy too many books for my little one (she's 1 now!). Instead, I check out 6 to 8 books per every 4 weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape. Plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies. The instructors are so talented. They sing and read books to our babies. They also bring toys for them to play with. My little girl loves it! And loves to be with the other babies as well. Awesome!
