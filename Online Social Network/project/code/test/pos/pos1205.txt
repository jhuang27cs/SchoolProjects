you know those dark, kind of spicy fries that are usually curly or crinkled? and you know how they're so so so good, but wouldn't they be better as waffle fries? i've thought this before. and my prayers have been answered. by southwell's. 

i have no idea where this place is, what the location looks like, no clue. all i know is you can phone in a cheeseburger and waffle fries and ten to fifteen minutes later your friends can walk in with the best french fries ever and a pretty damn tasty burger to go with them. & i hear the salads are good, but who cares? 

waffle fries. spicy waffle fries. the end.
