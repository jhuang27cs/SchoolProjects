Some of the best wild mushroom soup I have ever eaten in my life.  The salads and sandwiches are fresh and thoughtfully prepared.  The lemonade makes my mouth water with its mint and vanilla hints.  I have no idea of the service during the week as we went on a Saturday afternoon around 2.  It was very quiet and peaceful-- Christmas music was even softly playing in the background.  I was so impressed with this place that I couldn't help but go back Monday evening for some more of that amazing mushroom soup.  

Give it a try.
