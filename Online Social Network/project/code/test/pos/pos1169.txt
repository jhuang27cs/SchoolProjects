my favorite pizza joint. love the sauce, love the dough, love the toppings. Especially the sausage and mushroom. The mushroom is the best tasting mushroom on a pizza that I have ever had. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they put the mushrooms on part way through the cooking process so that it is not burned? love it!
