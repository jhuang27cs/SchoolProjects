Let me start off by saying I have very very expensive taste in eye wear.  So, after losing my favorite pair of Matsuda glasses I decided to pop in to Eclectic Eye wear and see what brands they carried.

I was so excited to see all the funky frames and I was completely shocked by the prices.  I am talking shocked in a very good way. I do not think I have purchased frames for less than 300.00 in my whole adult life.  So, when I found a pair I liked for less than 100.00 I was so excited and when they told me I could pick out another pair for for free I was like a poor kid in a candy store who gets to pick out whatever they want. It took a while to find the perfect pair from their limited selection. But, I finally decided and the bill for 2 frames with lenses was less than 150.00.

My only disappointment is that all the really cool funky frames are made for people with small faces - my face is wide through the eye area so none of the coolest ones fit my face.  This does not reflect in my rating because I have always had this problem.  But the more expensive brands like Matsuda often make their frames in 2 different sizes.

My last visit was 4 years ago and I had heard they closed so I was excited to log onto yelp and see recent reviews.  

Since, my Puppy recently ate my first choice I am in the market for a new pair.  So I will definitely be back soon.

Why minus 1 star they messed up my RX the first attempt but they hand delivered the correct Rx glasses to my business. The only reason I even mentioned it is because another review mentioned the same problem.
