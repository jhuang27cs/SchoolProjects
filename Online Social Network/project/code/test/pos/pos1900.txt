Indians. They're sneaky. They offer you a restaurant with delicious food that includes a buffet option; then to make sure you don't eat them out of house and home, they put mirrors all over the place to hopefully shame you into not stuffing your fat face. I of course am Indian and have no shame so I had more food than it should be physically possible to get inside of me.

The buffet option was a little more than $10.00 and once you include tip, it's closer to $14.00. This would be fine if there was more of a selection. This is possibly the first Indian buffet restaurant that had only something like 10-12 items to choose from. Yes, I consider that limited. Aside from that I have to say that what they do have is pretty delightful. I can't remember the last time I had vegetable samosas but I ate it with gusto. The lamb curry is less lamb and more curry. The vegetable korma is fantastic. The chicken wings are unbelievable in their perfect blend of Indian and American unhealthiness. The naan seems to never run out so load up on that and the chicken tikka masala and you're set. Quality is emphasized at this place and I really appreciate that.

Staff is meh. I've been told good things about them by friends and some of the reviews also mention it but I find them be rather aloof in their mannerisms. However, one cannot deny that they are courteous in speech and very professional. 

The (piddling) dessert offering at the end is a giant tease, because the mango ice cream is actually really good and does nothing more than annoy you because you want more.
