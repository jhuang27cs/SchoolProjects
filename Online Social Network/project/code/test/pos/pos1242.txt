My fave BURGER place.... Yes, I said burger. Their hangover is damn good, fried egg, chili, much more. Their chili cheese Tator tots is awesome, their sweetie pie is a to die for dessert of sweet potato tots with yummy goodness on top. 
I'm glad I can eat at this place and not be obese, but beware, don't eat the whole portion at once! It will start showing in your chin
