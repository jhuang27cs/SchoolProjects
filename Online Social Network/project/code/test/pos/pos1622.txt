This is simply the best LSAT prep!!  During the time in my life when I thought I wanted to go to law schools & be a lawyer, I signed up for Blueprint because who can resist those sexy ads on Bruin walk?  Although I ended up not going to law school & pursuing a career in medicine..... LSAT was still very helpful!!  THE BEST!

I had Trent as my instructor and he makes each lesson entertaining & informational.  He was crude, rude, HILARIOUS, ridiculously smart & a great teacher.  He knew exactly what he was doing & he knew exactly how to make you ace the LSAT.  

The books were great.  Really helpful & a ton of practice problems.  Each lesson was super helpful.  They taught you exactly how to tackle each type of LSAT question...literally EVERY TYPE.  By the end of the session you knew exactly how to solve each problem...with a little bit of practice of course.  

I started out with a score of 143 and by the time I finished Blueprint I had a 163.  I think I could have done better with more practice...but it was a fun summer that year and I just couldn't find the discipline.  But hey!! I improved by 20 points!!!! That's gotta tell you something!!! I also know a lot of people that took Blueprint and ended up in the 160s or the 170s.  

You really can't compare any other program out there to Blueprint.  Blueprint specializes in the LSAT & only the LSAT unlike other preps.  they also offer special classes for writing your personal statement, or even special classes for those who want to only practice logic games.  They have everything you need with the best instructors & the best learning tools.  If you choose Blueprint--which you should--you will not regret a single penny spent!
