The Pinata House is awesome! I had a pinata made for my baby shower and it was exactly what I wanted and all I told them was "A diaper filled with poo" which was not much to give them. The diaper was exactly the right size and the "poo" inside was tamarindo candies! The pinata was the biggest hit and everyone was asking about it. and now that the baby is born, I know exactly where go to to have alllll of her customized birthday pinatas made until she's 50!!!
