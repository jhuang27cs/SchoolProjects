Don't tell anyone else but...

(((((I'd never been to upstairs on the square until now)))))

I don't know why.
I don't know how.
All I do know is that this was not a planned stop on our outing for the evening, but after running into some friends, we popped on over here to grab a seat a few more drinks at the bar.

The interior is an explosion of unique style - either you love it or hate it. I, frankly, would marry it if I could. Eccentricity at it's finest, girly fun meets uptown chic meets sex kitten prowess. Sounds odd for dining, but I did it.

The bartender was marvelous and busted out a drink that was so now and so on point (the Tennessee..wikipedia that shizz) and my companion selected a bottle of sparkling wine that was quite nice. We even got to sample so yummy cabernet and an interesting zinfandel, courtesy their resident wine guru, Matt, who took the time to explain the different varietals and chat with us about some of his more interesting wine adventures.

To nosh, we had a sampling of pizza and a caprice-style mozzarella with tomatoes dish. Both delectable...both nicely portioned. A nice little sneak peak of what my soon-to-be-dinner there will entail. Zebra-covered couches and bright pink walls, I will be back!
