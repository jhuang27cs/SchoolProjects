The service was "WOOHOO! As good as it gets!" 

First of all, picture this: stressed out woman with a car that won't start. Never pretty. Then picture this: the tow guy speculating on what it could be. Not pretty either. Now, picture this: a friend/co-worker suggests a nice, small shop right in the heart of Central Pasadena with a professional attitude, and affordable prices. HELLO! 

Saul's Auto Service was sincerely everything an auto shop should be: well equipped, knowledgeable, friendly and FAST. No BS, no hidden up sales, just the problem and the fix. THANK GOODNESS! 

After much stress, and back and forth from Nissan with yet more speculation regarding the unknown problem, Saul was able to determine that my baby (Nissan Altima--yeah, that model) suffered from a dead battery. YES! All ready for pick up. Thank you! 

If in need and in Pasadena, definitely check out Saul's Auto Service. Awesome service.
