Use to go to Zankou Chicken until I found this place. Waaaaay better. Their plates come with rice and salad instead of ....ummm, pickled beats (gross). The chicken shwarma is much better here also. Haven't had any bad experiences yet so far and have tried most of the stuff on the menu. Not sure about that napkin situation, but I always get mine to go. I live right around the corner from this place but would drive about 5 miles if I had to because I always feel full and great afterwards. A great place to get fresh delicious food fast and at a good price.
