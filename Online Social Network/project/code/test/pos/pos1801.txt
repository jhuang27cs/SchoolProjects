Some of the best vegetarian food I have ever had! I go to UCLA but am here visiting a friend and after having Hare Krishna food yesterday, I wish I came to UCSD!

Absolutely delicious and healthy.  Get in line (that moves very fast like everyone said), grab a plate (or tupperware), sit underneath the trees nearby and enjoy!

Hare Krishna near UCSD, please serve more than one day a week (or have recipes of your dishes available)!

Hare Krishna near UCLA, please come serve us vegetarian food!
