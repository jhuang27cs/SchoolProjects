I really liked Hungry Mother.  I read all the reviews and tried the beef tongue, shrimp and grits, the chicken and the steak.  It was all really good and we left really full!   The service was really good too.  However, I am not sure if it really had the WOW factor.  I only gave it 4 stars, instead of three, because I was really in the mood for a Reisling and they didn't have any but the waitress suggested the Vouvray, and it was perfect! I think that I may have held it to a higher standard bacause everyone gave it 5 stars and described the food with passion.....
