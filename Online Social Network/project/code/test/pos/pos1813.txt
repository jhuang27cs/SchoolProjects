Gluten-free wise, the staff takes dietary requests very seriously.  I've only ever had the chicken enchiladas - you have to request that they be made gf.  They are really good and cheesy, tex-mex style. I'm not sure that anything else on the menu can be gf - every time I've asked, I've been encouraged to stick with chicken enchiladas.  The free chips are not gf - the oil is used for wheaty things, so buyer beware.  If you don't like noise, try to eat early - it's usually pretty crowded.

Update - I've been informed that the chips are gf.  I can also attest that the enchiladas can be made dairy free and gf and they are still delicious.
