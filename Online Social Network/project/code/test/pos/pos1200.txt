this is an all around great place. first of all it crosses many borders, it's a grocery, it's a restaurant, it's a place to congregate, socialize, read, hangout. everyone who comes here can create their own unique vision about foster's which is why i like it so much. the food is fresh and they have a wide variety of choices.
