Just left this place from having a late lunch/early dinner, and I am very happy. The portions are very nicely sized and the flavor was incredible. The food was spiced but not overly spicy in heat. And the service was very friendly. 

I had the pav bhaji and the samosa. The pav bhaji was exactly how my friends mom used to make for me, and came with 6 pieces of buttered toast! (that's just for one person!) Next time I would get that as an appetizer for 2 to 3 people and then each of us would get something else. 

Overall, this place is cheap for the price but huge for the portions and flavor. Go there now!
