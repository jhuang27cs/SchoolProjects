intermezzo offers a variety of straight-forward, hearty, and tasty sandwiches and salads. if you're craving some fresh greens presented in a completely unpretentious fashion, this berkeley favorite is an excellent choice.

they excel when it comes to sandwiches. again, not because they are particularly inventive or fancy, but rather due to the freshness and sheer volume of ingredients. the mustard they use is nice and tangy - it's best alongside a monstrous chunk of cream cheese and what seems to be a whole avocado in their vegetarian sandwich. their bread can't be beat - baked fresh right in their kitchen.

seating can be a bit of a challenge, especially in groups of more than two. also, the line runs out the door more times than not. if you're traveling with an entourage, your best bet might be to call in your order, have one person pick it up and enjoy the tastiness elsewhere.
