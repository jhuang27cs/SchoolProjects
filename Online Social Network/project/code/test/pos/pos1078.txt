I really loved this restaurant. The chefs are awesome and the food was really good. Plus you can't beat good sushi at half price every night for happy hour. You really can't. I had Tamago, Urchin, Octopus, the Sandra Roll, the #5 Roll, and the Tuna Jalapeno sashimi.
In the words of Kuitan, OOOO-ishi!
