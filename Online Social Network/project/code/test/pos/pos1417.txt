I love Ashleigh!  She is very current, helpful, patient & knowledgable.  I wasn't thrilled with my last set of highlights from a different salon and was looking for someone new.  I happened to see the groupon one day for a partial highlight & color and called Ashleigh.  I wasn't able to get in that day but she honored the groupon price.  She was very helpful when I was trying to decide on my color and my hair turned out great!  The salon is conveniently located, too.  I will definitely continue to go to Ashleigh and proudly refer all my friends.
