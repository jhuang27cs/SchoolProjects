I really enjoyed going to Publik after dinner one random night.  It is right next to the Theater, so it might be hard to find parking, but it's worth looking around.

The bar itself is really clean and nice inside.  Service is spot on and the beer selection is GREAT.  Some beers are pricier than others, but coming from NYC everything seemed cheap to me!

Good time and will be back!
