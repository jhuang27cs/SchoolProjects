Fondue is a must-try experience, and can make a very romantic date, though it definitely isn't an every day kind of thing.   First, it takes forever.  Second, because it takes so long, you leave hungry.  Third, you do the work yourself.  Fourth, it's expensive, especially considering you're doing all the cooking.

The Melting Pot ended up being our favorite fondue place in San Diego, over Forever Fondue, and we only went there because we had a gift card.  The decor is upscale, the service is satisfactory, and the atmosphere is intimate (not somewhere to go with a platonic co-worker).

Our dinner selections were the cheddar cheese (bread, veggies, apples for dippers) and Fondue Fusion (lobster, filet, salmon, pork tenderloin, shrimp, chicken, pasta, and veggies as dippers).  

For dessert we had the dark chocolate with Chambord, and the dippers included strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, brownies, and marshmallows.

All of the food was very good, though we wished we had more of the cheese, as it ran out quickly.

Even with our $50 gift card, we ended up spending around $100 for dinner and wine.  As suggested by others, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to skip the dinner course, and just have the cheese and chocolate.
