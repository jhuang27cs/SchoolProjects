When a place calls itself a 'Papuseria', they'd better bring it with the eponymous foodstuff - and Guanaco's has earned every right to call itself that. Ever papusa I've tried there rose to the standard I am familiar with (growing up in SF, had easy access to the Mission, which produces as good of Mexican, El Salvadoran, Guatemalan, etc., food as I've had anywhere) and exceeded it. As did the fried yucca and empanadas, both of which I'm not usually a fan of, but fell in love with at Guanaco's. Also, the prices are scary low - you'd think that you can't possibly get anything of quality for 2 bucks, and you'd be very, very wrong.
