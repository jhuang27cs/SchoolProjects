Definitely a College Park secret.  Who knew that hidden behind the college bar scene and infinite choice of fast food chains lies Lake Artemesia.  I know there's a parking lot accessible from 193 somewhere..but as a resident of Parkside, my run around the lake and back of 5K was the perfect daily run.  Don't be surprised if you see people fishing or bird watching.

Trail Directions from Parkside:  Exit Parkside and go down Lakelands.  Turn right after the playgound and look for the paved trail next to the basketball court.  Turn left at the three-way trail intersection.  Continue on the trail past the elementary school.  Turn right at the dead end and follow the path under the metro tracks.  This should lead you directly to the lake.
