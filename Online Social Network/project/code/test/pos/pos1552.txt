My wife and I went to A Cafe with a Groupon and left happy.  The service was great (which is typical when the owner is the server).  Food was very good French fusion food.  We loved our appetizers and argued over whose was better (I got the escargot with sop-it-up yummy cilantro-chili butter sauce, and my wife got the grilled avocado).  We tried to be daring with the entrees and were a little disappointed after having had such great appetizers.  We got the seitan meatloaf, which couldn't avoid the fact that it was made with seitan (somehow I thought I'd finally like seitan, but I was wrong).  The rabbit sausages were tasty but not as great as I had hoped.  Overall a very nice night, topped off with a very nice red wine that we brought (BYOB makes it a much less expensive evening!)
