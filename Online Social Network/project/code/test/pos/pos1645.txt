Usually after the annual Revlon Run/Walk we stroll through here on the way back.

This place is tranquil and a great way to forget you're in a big city of concrete and steel.

I especially like how huge it all is. Just so many roses. I can imagine that weddings that happen nearby would end up coming here for a few photos to be taken. It's just very scenic and beautiful.
