I was first introduced to this sweet slice of heaven a few years ago by my significant other. I loved it the first time and I still love it till today.

I've tried most of the flavors they have and I've been a fan of their red velvet for quite some time, but my recent favorite has now been their chocolate marshmallows!

If your looking to check out this place I recommend to just do it. It may not be the best cupcake I've ever tasted but its still one of my faves especially when I have a sweet tooth.
