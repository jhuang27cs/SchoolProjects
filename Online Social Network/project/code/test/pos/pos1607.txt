This is my favorite Philz location, there's a lot of natural light and the place is spacy enough where you can find a seat.  The only confusing part was the ordering process.  Be sure to order with a barista before paying for it, pay for your drink, then go back to the barista to pick up your hand crafted drink.  Mint mojito, I can't wait to go back for more!
