Really cool space (RMG TV added a nice touch). Rockwells in the bathrooms, water while you wait for your takeout, & impeccable service. Owner helped me out, really nice guy...smoked salmon/ratatouille egg/scallions savory crepe was excellent and the triple chocolate crepe with dark/white chocolate/& coconut was an awesome sweet treat. Lot of food...bit pricy but not expensive...it goes to the fresh ingredients you can see them prepare.
