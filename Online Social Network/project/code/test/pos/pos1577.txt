I think people toss around 5 star reviews far too freely, but Cinnaholic really deserves it. 

This place is simply delicious. The fact that the products are vegan really doesn't matter to me, but it is worth noting. These are simply the best cinnamon rolls that I have ever had, vegan or otherwise. The flavor choices are out of this world. Just go there now and give them all of your money.

Also, it's worth noting that the only thing on the walls (besides the menu) were 3 Misfits posters. That really deserves 6 stars.
