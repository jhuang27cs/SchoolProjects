Stopped by for a quick meal before going to a friend's house. Menu was pretty standard for a Thai place, although the prices were a bit higher than I've seen at other places. This is probably due to the nicely decorated interior, which doesn't look like a market but has some nice urban touches (bare lightbulbs in front of the cash register) but maintains a chic restaurant elegance - most notable were the bowls and plates in which the food was served, which are uniquely shaped. I ordered the green curry, which was quite delicious. The variety of Thai spices and the sweetness of the coconut milk combined to make for a great rice topping and a filling dinner. Another hit for the UWS!
