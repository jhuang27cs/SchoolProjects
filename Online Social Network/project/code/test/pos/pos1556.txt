This is my new favorite place for dinner in Troy. I have been there twice now and the specials are amazing, you can tell that the chef really knows flavors and how to combine them well while not overdoing it.

The chef has also come out to greet the diners and ask how everything was both times I was there, I like that. 

I do have to say the first time I was a bit thrown off by the "front of the house", but I can see how it is hard for them as they use the front as their lunch area and by night it is essentially the kitchen.. but the 2nd time we were greeted and seated immediately, so they have already improved on that.

Anyways, its great to see specials that consistently change and a regular menu that has a good amount of variety and creativity to it. They also post their specials and some deals on their facebook rather daily.

I respect a few of the other fine dining establishments that are in close vicinity, and wont put them down by name here. But the Illium has been taking the cake recently, and are reminding me of what I used to like about those other restaurants a few years ago. Hopefully Illium can keep up the momentum.
