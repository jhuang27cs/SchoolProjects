HUGE SLICE for $5 

Cheese was not too thick, Crust was great, and the pepperoni was less red and more pink-ish & less artificial; aside from size, pretty standard as far as NY pizza goes.

Just a heads up: there's only a bar along the wall with chairs, and no tables. Ideal for a late night snack with a buddy or two. Big groups have to stand outside and obstruct sideway pedestrian traffic.
