This place defines hole in the wall in a really great way. I love seedy spots with unidentifiable carpet, broken chairs, cigarette burns and lone star but this bar is small, clean, and really well done with its use of space. 

They've got a nice list of cocktails, a super sweet bartender and a neighborhood vibe. Love that you can order in food in and that the AC is cranked down to about 70. The walls are have sweet posters and funky little decorations (whales and such) as a nice background to their decent selection on tap. Dig the Tommy pinball machine and the dark, cool feel of the place. 

Though I probably wont get to it a lot as I'm usually up north or downtown, it's definitely a spot I've recommended since my visit. I imagine I'll continue to do so... especially as an alternative to dog and duck.
