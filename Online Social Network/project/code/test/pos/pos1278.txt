I love how you can customize your own burger. The have gluten free bun which is a plus, since I can't eat certain grains. The burger pretty good. Nicely season!! 

- Service was good!!  My waiter was helpful on recommendation.
- Parking in a structure. Get a validation if you stay under 30 mins.
- Took one star off because the own wasn't so friendly.
