a pretty busy place, but fast paced and moves. the wait- at least for take out- is just a couple of minutes. the parking can be a drag, tho. kinda tight, space wise, though it's no tighter than any cafe i've been to in italy, france, holland, or germany- so i'm not complaining.

i'm not interested in the food- though i must admit it looks good, but the sweets are stellar, and the fresh bread is awesome. salted caramels are fantastic- the candy itself, I mean. the croissants are great, not a greasy buttery mess like some places, 

the staff are helpful, a touch hurried, but super cool. i await the day i have time to sit a spell, and have some coffee, too.
