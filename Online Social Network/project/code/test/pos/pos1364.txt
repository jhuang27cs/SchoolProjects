The Crepes are so good!!! Perfect texture, big serving, and yummy nutella, chocolate, bananas, and strawberries (= 

Also tried the gelato banana split and eh it was alright. The gelato flavors aren't that amazing.  We got almond, mint chip, and oreo, but we had a hard time deciding cause nothing was great. The almond was pretty good, the mint was very strong, and the oreo was eh. Also I don't like how they put pineapple in the banana split, kinda weird. Definitely looks better than it tastes.

The atmosphere is pretty cool, they have these green and red lights that make it seem like there are bubbles floating on the wall (= Clean place and the lady helping us was nice and let us try as many of the gelato flavors as we wanted.

I'd go back for the crepes definitely!
