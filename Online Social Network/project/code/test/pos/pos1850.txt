I try to come here at least once every few months or so just to see what I'm not buying at House of Secrets.  Because Comics Factory seems to order EVERY SINGLE COMIC that comes out every month.  I've never not found what I'm looking for here.  

So go here.  And after you're done, read your comics next door at Zankou while you get heartburn on their yummy chicken.
