This place is so relaxing.  So wonderful. Especially on Friday and Saturday nights when there is live music.  Friday has Flamenco Guitar and Saturday is a bit more James Taylor.

There is an awesome outdoor area (with heaters).  The fireplace is a prime location.  So are the booths along the walls.  Lotsa padding and pillows.  If you wanna get away but can't leave San Diego ... go here and just pretend.  It'll transport you to another place ... really!

There is a full bar, great wine list and fabulous food.  

If you'd rather sit inside, there's a tele, fireplace and more seating.

Save a seat for me ... wouldya?
