I've been wanting to try this place for the entire school year and I managed to finally get around to it last night (my last day for 9 months as I'm studying abroad in the fall.) 

I really liked it.  The burger looks HUGE when you get it, but it's really just the mountain of lettuce they put on.  Seriously, it's intense - I took about half of it off.  I think we all ordered bacon cheeseburgers and fries.  Absolutely nothing to complain about!  They were quick, cheap, and yummy.  The menu is also more extensive than I imagined, with American, Mexican, and various breakfast items.  I will definitely be going back when I'm back in LA. (And will probably have to try the fried chicken and horchata as I didn't realize they had it.)

Payment: I heard it used to be cash only.  They now take cards but charge you close to a dollar to do so.
