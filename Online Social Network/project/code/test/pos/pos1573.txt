I've been a Mac weenie for a long time, reinforced by enough lost hours on a Dell that, after adding up the recorded down hours, totaled over $10k in losses over a year. (Dude! You got a ... piece of shit!). I have been pretty loyal to the Mac Store on 45th, but had to walk into this place whilst walking by on my way to someplace from someplace else.

I dig the architecture of the Apple Stores, as well as the layout, and the ability to play with all the gadgets. I have tried out several items before buying, though I usually buy the really expensive stuff online.

However, I have gotten good info on how to solve a couple wiring and networking problems from the sales folk. I also dig that they can ring me up from their weird gadgets around their neck. However, I have thought it was weird for quite a while that the gadgets aren't Apple products... strange that a company who pays so much attention to detail and has two of the best selling hand held gadgets ever (iPod/iPhone) doesn't have a portable POS system.

Or at least didn't last time I was in.

I haven't dealt with the Genius Bar, so I have no idea how that whole system works.

I have, however, dealt with the nifty little bags they put your new stuff in, and I like them almost as much as the stuff that goes in them.
