I absolutely love Noah's Bagels! They are super delicious and have amazing cream cheese. ( And I'm not even a fan of cream cheese)!
The only reason why I do not give it a five star is because the customer service is not that nice. They have always been pessimistic every time that I have walked in. It's barely 12pm in the afternoon and they no longer have certain bagels? =/ It just doesn't make sense. It's happened to me 3 times already and they just say " what you see is what you get" and that's just not cool. 

I hear they are nicer at the Foothill location.
