I am always looking for little ways to reward myself (even on days when I dont really earn it)... Dhaba Joy is one of those small rewards. I am in love with the Vegan Cranberry-Walnut Muffins... they are HUGE & quite tasty even for a devoted carnivore such as myself! & yes, the espresso drinks are great! Aside from the luxury of persuring the wonder that is Toy Joy... I do most all of my greeting card shopping here. They keep the racks well stocked, & the selection is equal parts vintage, quirky, & beautiful!
