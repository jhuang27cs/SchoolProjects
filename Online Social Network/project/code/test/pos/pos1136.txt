Wow. 

The food here was delicious (among the best fine dining meals I've sampled in Boston) but the staff and service at this place was truly, truly exceptional. It *was* the best I've experienced in Boston...and ranks up there with the best anywhere.  

Definitely recommend and definitely going back.
