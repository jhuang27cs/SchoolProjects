Ahhh yes... the memories.  There's nothing like hanging out with an old friend at an old spot where good beer flows so freely.  

Current Promo: $3.95 for 12oz house beer

I got a Blonde and my friend got their Hef.  Both are quite good (I've had both before).  Upon tasting it for the first time after a year or two, it was... music to my... lips?  Deeeeelish!  Loooove the Blondes there... 

The service was very good too.  She tended to our needs very frequently, checking up on us, making sure we were good.  I definitely appreciated the quality experience.  

Oh... and I miss Westwood!  Go Bruins!  hehe
