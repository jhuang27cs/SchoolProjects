This review isn't even for my actual appointment. It's for my experience booking my appointment.

Even while on the phone, Dale noticed that I asked a question, and he still answered VERY thoroughly. Like a 5-minutes-of-shouting-accross-the-room-to-make-sure-I-hear type of thing. He was honest about his thoughts about the treatments I was inquiring about and both he and the receptionist were the most patient people I have probably ever spoken on the phone with. They answered all of my questions and even managed to give a very rough price quote. ( I always ask for one.)

...which is why I booked an appointment to spend ~$300-$400 on my hair. :)
