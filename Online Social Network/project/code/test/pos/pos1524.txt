Ever since I discovered Unicorn via Dining Out for Life (the foodie fundraising event I coordinate), I've been a fan. I had dinner there again last night and was reminded why I love them so much. By the way, dine here on Thursday, April 24th and Unicorn will donate 35% to a local HIV/AIDS organization. www.diningoutforlife.com 

Service. Perfect! Attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They gave great instructions to peeps at our table on how to make rice paper wraps and  turned up the heat to warm us up (it was cold last night!).

1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays and Tuesdays!!!! I probably don't need to say more but I will. They start the evening off with a free "palate cleanser" - passionfruit sorbet with some sparkling wine. Yummmmm!

We started with the green mango rolls and the taro rolls. The green mango rolls were my favorite..fresh, crisp, and tasty.  You get 6 pieces so sharing one order is plenty. I had the Singaporean Curry noodles w/prawns and broccoli for my entree. It was spicy and the broccoli was cooked through but crisp....just the way I like it.

I tried a bite of chicken kebab (rice paper wrap) and it was delicious! I didn't try my friend's sea bass but judging from the empty plate I'd say he liked it. 

I'll definitely be back again and again!
