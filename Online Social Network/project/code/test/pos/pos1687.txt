Surprised at all of the bad reviews. I'm purely in it for the better-than-average dog food selection (it's not extensive, as the store is very tiny, just a few holistic brands that boast better ingredients than most brands you'll find at big-box pet stores) and it serves that purpose quite well. My only reason for not giving a 5th star is that now my dog is hooked on this particular kind of food & I can't find it at any mainstream pet store.

Most natural brands of food will run $10-16 for a 5lb bag & the store clerk suggested that I try Fromm's brand, because of the good ingredient & it being a family-owned company based out of Wisconsin. She gave me a handful of single serving bags of different varieties to take home before I made my final selection. The 5lb bag is a mere $12 and you'll save about that amount of money by volume if you level up & buy the 33lb bag. She hooked me up with a frequent buyer card that they hang onto at the desk so I don't need to remember to bring it in.

Sure some of their non-food items are priced rather high but that's expected from any boutique store, which this clearly is. I stop in frequently just to browse and the owner & other employees have never been anything but jovial and informative. And sure they're not quick to jump when you walk in the door but the store is about the size of a large bedroom so it's not difficult to find a clerk if you've got a question. I almost prefer to be left to my own devices & if I need a hand I'll ask for one, so this is a non-issue for me.
