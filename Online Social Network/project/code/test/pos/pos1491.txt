A gem tucked between Morningside Heights and Harlem (across the street from the subway station). The decor is intimate and comfortable. I felt immediately welcomed by the owner. He brought an entire chalkboard over to our table to show us the specials and seemed genuinely concerned about our wellbeing and comfort. The calamari was delicious, as well as our pasta dishes. Pair your dish with a glass of wine, and you've got the perfect dinner (at least around this area) without breaking the bank.
