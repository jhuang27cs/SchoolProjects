I came here with a friend and her young child for my first visit.  What a nice and friendly place!  The staff was super sweet and helpful and suggested some different teas for my friend.  I ended up getting a white tea which was nice.  

The cafe has both tables and comfortable side seating (long comfy bench).  I believe they also have a couple of comfy chairs.  In addition to the internet, they have made this a cozy place with games that customers can play with - both for adults and children!  My friend's child ahd the time of his life.  

I'll definitely be going back!
