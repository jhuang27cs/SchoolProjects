I've eaten here three times in the past few months and am hooked on the fish tacos.  The haddock is deep fried, but it comes out tasting light and the flavor of the fish comes through.  Have dined there in groups of 6-8 and have always had good service and everyone has been happy with their food, with one exception: my husband wasn't thrilled with the steak ranchero, but that may be more because he wanted a traditional American-style steak and the server took his order for "medium rare" without explaining the dish to him...there was no medium rare to be had.

Friendly service, with small bowls of fresh hot chips and both red and green salsa delivered repeatedly before and throughout the meal.  Good $2.00 margaritas.  Wish this weren't so far from home!
