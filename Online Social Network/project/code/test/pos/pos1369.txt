It was just what I was looking for. Mario our server was very attentive and made my friend and I feel comfortable. We had a large appetizer and we decided to split a dish. I am not one to do that but after a few glasses of wine the tasty bread and appetizer  with prosciutto that melted on your tongue; I knew I could not dig into a an entree. Splitting the dish was perfect. We had the seafood risotto and it came out steaming hot to were I needed to let cool down a little. The shrimp had a nice texture and bite. The mussels and clams were plump and clean. They charge a small fee but way worth it. I wish I had room for dessert. Next time I will make sure I do. It was nice to see the restaurant busy and feel well taken care of. Great food and service and you do not have to spend tons of cash. Looking forward to the next time.
