Nice alternative to going to a more college aged club. I liked the mix of people here as well. There are tons of grad student looking types, more likely PhD students, as well as some older people. You will feel like you fit in here, regardless of your age. I even saw this mom in her 40s trying to get girls to dance with her 20something son. It was the cutest. The place did get really crowded close to midnight. At times you could hardly dance because there were just so many people. Reasonable prices for stuff at their bar. Cheap parking in the lot nextdoor.
