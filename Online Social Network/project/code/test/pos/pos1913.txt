This place can really be hit or miss, just as any thrift/vintage/consignment store can be. But I feel like if you've got enough time on your hands and the strength to haul your finds away, there are definitely treasures to be had.

The Garment District is memorable for two specific occasions- Halloween, and the 50% off everything in-store sale, which happens twice a year. Halloween is a madhouse but the Garment District really does have anything and everything you could possibly need for a costume. Is it worth paying that much for a pre-made outfit when you could scavenge the clothes needed from the thrift section upstairs? But the real winner is the biannual sale, in which I took home a wool peacoat, a silk kimono, some cardigans, and two button-downs for the BF for about $30. Other times I've found Cole Haan suede boots in exactly my size, and amazing funky t-shirts and jackets. Sometimes all you end up with are slightly inflamed sinuses from all the dust and disinfectant. But hey, it's worth it.
