Free museum!!!! Woohoo. If you park there, you have to pay for that, but I live near USC so I was able to walk there.  Even the special exhibits were free.  The CSI exhibit is fun, though a little too easy, which shouldn't be the case considering it's adult subject matter. 

The museum isn't particularly huge, but there's certainly enough there to keep you occupied. My girlfriend and I didn't get to see everything in the few hours we had so we're definately going back. The IMAX is nice too (not free of course). And of course, there's freeze-dried astronaut food in the shop. Hooray!

Ironically, for a museum focused on science and health, the main choices for food are McDonald's and Taco Bell Express...but there's also a cafe which serves semi-healthy alternatives. 

Considering that the museum is free (save for parking), I definitely recommend this for adults and kids.
