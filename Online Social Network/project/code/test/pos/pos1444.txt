When it comes to Six Feet Under, I am grossly myopic. All I can order is my beloved combo taco plate with two calamari and one shrimp. 

Such was the case Monday night when my mother treated me for my Birthday. Mixing up the scenery from our usual Memorial location, we scored a bar seat on the rooftop deck. Per the mild early spring weather, the interior eatery section remained deserted, while the deck sat packed with patrons. 

As the evening progressed, mid- and high-rise windows began to turn orange with the reflection of the setting sun, beautifully illumining downtown, Midtown and Buckhead landmarks. 

Since I'm so narrow-minded about trying new things at Six Feet, at least I mixed it up with beautiful urban scenery.
