Charming cafe: one room dining with colorful artwork on the walls.  

Fast service and turnover of diners: we waited 15 minutes at most amidst of many waiting diners.  Server came pretty quickly to take our orders.

No-frills but decent food: Breakfast menu consisted of the staples-eggs, French toast, pancakes (their specialty).  I got their special pumpkin pancakes with cinnamon and powdered sugar, which came out hot and nicely made.  Friend got French toast with strawberries, and he enjoyed his meal as well.
