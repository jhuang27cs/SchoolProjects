You can never go wrong with Brown Bag - great sandwiches at reasonable prices.

I go to the one on Amherst at least twice a week.  There's free parking in front of the store, and all around the buildings (it's in the Rice Village shopping center).

You go in, get a clipboard, fill out your order and then give it to the cashier, who rings you up.  A sandwich, chips and a drink is like $8.50, which is not bad at all.

The sandwiches are packed with meats and cheese, and you have a wide selection of veggies and condiments.  Sides include chips, potato salad, fruit, etc.  Desserts, too!

You have got to order the jalapeno bread - it is delicious.

Plenty of indoor seating; no outdoor seating at the Amherst location.  There's also a computer with Internet access, and free wi-fi if memory serves me right.
