Went here last night with some colleagues. Kudos to the restaurant for last minute finding us an extra seat and they were pretty full. The strawberry caipirinha was a little sweet, but still tasty. The bottle of Conde de Valdemar '05 was exquisite. 

Food wise myself and one other person decided to go with tapas. We had the Turkish Meze Plate, Grilled marinated peaches and Saris Lamb. Everything had wonderful flavor. The muhammara was awesome, very flavorful and went well with the white bean puree. The peaches with marscapone and goat cheese -- wow! The lamb was good, but I won't say it was anything special compared to the other two dishes. 

All in all an extremely satisfying meal.
