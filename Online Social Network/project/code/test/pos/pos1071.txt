I arrived at 12:30 so there was quite a line already but it went fairly quickly - the staff seems very efficient.

I ordered the Farmhouse salad and requested cheddar cheese instead of blue cheese and they happily obliged. It was a generous size and the ingredients were fresh. the Potbelly vinaigrette was light and delicious. I also like that they post calorie content on each of their menu items and low calorie options are easy to identify. The drink selection is a bit pricey ($2 for a bottle of iced tea or lemonade). 

There's a nice terrace to enjoy your lunch outdoors and the location directly across from the University of PA hospital is hard to beat (especially if you're wary of food trucks - which I am).
