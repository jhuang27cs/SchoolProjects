I received a 2 night stay as a birthday gift.  The grounds at estancia are lush.  The pool and jacuzzi are great.  Warm, and large enoughin size that even at peak hours, it's not super crowded.  Our room was well appointed.  Having read tons of other reviewed, I brought my own snacks to avoid room service.  There is a tiny fridge I each room,and I loaded my snack is in there. 

The room was clean, had a small balcony that overlooked the pool area.  Estancia is very quiet, slow paced and relaxing.


If you are a cheap bastard, don't bother coming here. There's a $17.00 resort fee, and valet is $25.00/day.


And, FYI, the valet service is swamped on weekend evenings because there is always an event going on.  Be calm, grasshopper. Be patient.  You are onvacationfor gods' sake.
