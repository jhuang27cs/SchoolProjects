Mexicali keeps very odd hours, but if you can manage to get there when they're open, their burritos are very good. 

I usually order the tofu one with plantains + avocado, and they're seriously fantastic. Their portions are pretty huge, so I usually get a small burrito and it's more than filling. They also understand how to properly wrap a burrito, so it doesn't fall apart on you. 

Whenever I find myself in that part of the city, I try to make it a point to stop by (though only half the time are they actually open).
