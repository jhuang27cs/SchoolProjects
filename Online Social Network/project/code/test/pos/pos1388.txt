so i was studying @ the Calabasas library nearby and the sign for this place caught my eye...

food for the gods...challenge accepted!

i first tried to order their "kobe burger", which was priced @ $10...highly unlikely to be true Kobe beef, but i was curious. however, this was around 430pm and they were sold out of them... :(

i instead went with my favorite sandwich, the turkey club...because it's simple and has avocado and bacon...which in my opinion, makes everything taste better. it was also cool that they asked me if i wanted white, dark, or mixed turkey meat! being an unhealthy bastard, i went and chose the dark meat. i added a side of garlic fries and a soft drink to go along with it and it came out to be around $14 something...a bit steep in price, since i am still kind of a starving college student. 

i got the order to go, which took a little while to make...but it was definitely worth the wait. it came neatly organized in a paper bag and the fries came with a side of ranch (i believe they make it fresh). the sandwich was very tasty and the dark meat was very tender and juicy. the garlic fries were also amazing and fresh! although, i found clumps of ground up garlic here n there, it would've been better if they tossed the fries so that the garlic was evenly spread. still, it was very tasty and if i'm ever in the area, i'd come back to chomp on their "kobe burger" as well as try their other sandwiches!
