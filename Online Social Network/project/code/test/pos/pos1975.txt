Pretty nice place, I think they did a nice job and mean well. The only detraction I can find are some ppl stick around all day, but mostly functioning real ppl exist there. 

Anywhere they will offer you nice seating, 30 mins of free internet, and a nice location, what else do you want them to do for you - get you a free lap dance?
