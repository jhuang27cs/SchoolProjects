I consider myself a hot dog expert because mainly, I worked the hot dog cart for almost 7 years, to put myself through college.  I'm quite a hot dog snub because after working in the industry, I know an exceptional hot dog to an ok one.   So, I don't take this lightly when I say that this is one of the best dressed hot dogs i've had. The only hot dog place that I go to is Pink's in LA and this place comes close.  The teriyaki and the shredded pork were phenomenal!  Good job!
