A year later, I enthusiastically update and echo Julie P's five stars and comments. My dealings were from two thousand miles away, to order Valentine's Day flowers for our daughter at UMich. I settled on Chelsea via yelp.

 As Julie P wrote, the customer service was fantastic: in-the-know; price sensitive/conscious; happy to offer suggestions; totally re-assuring on delivery...her knowledge was key since I know very little about flowers.

 I tossed out a price range; the representative was free to select; a gorgeous order was timely delivered to our daughter (she texted us pictures to prove!) and as long as she's in Ann Arbor, we're using Chelsea!
