I hardly need to add to the long list of good reviews, so I'll keep this short.

Positives:

As a soon-to-be Pitt employee, I'm awfully glad that this place is just around the corner in Oakland.  Good menu of (I think) Thai and Burmese dishes.  Fantastic tea menu with a nice group-couch area up front seemingly for those who just want tea and conversation.  Nice art and furniture.  Well organized menu.  Lots of healthy items, and just about anything can be made vegetarian if that's your thing.  Very affordable; one person could easily do a filling lunch for ~$10 with a drink.  And prompt service with a smile.

Negatives:

Minor things, really.  The menu is a tad long, though admittedly, there are some interesting dishes that you don't normally see in a SE Asian restaurant.  The lighting is great if there's some sun in the sky, but was a bit too dim on a cloudy 2/10/2010.  My dish--the Garden Veggies with Sweet Ginger Sauce and tofu--tasted great, but was way too saucy.  More veggies, less sauce, would have made it perfect.  Lastly, it's unfortunately got a very unappealing facade, but don't judge this place by the cover.

I plan to return and to recommend it highly to others.
