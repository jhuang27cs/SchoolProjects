Another one of those things you have to try at least once if you are visiting Pittsburgh for the very first time.  I had seen them on Travel Channel as one of the Top 10 places in the country to Pig Out.  So when we came to Pittsburgh, PA, and was on vacation, I had to try it.  

It was as good as advertised.  They put the French Fries in the Sandwich and it is definitely quite unique.  

If I am ever back in Pittsburgh, I will definitely grab me another Primanti Brothers Sandwich to Pig Out On!!!
