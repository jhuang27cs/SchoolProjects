The Miracle of Science is a very unique place. They have a great, full bar and their menu is something like I've never seen; it is written in a chemistry table of elements. Very original and I digg that, really. Their food is pretty good and the prices are good as well. Their coffee is very good and so is their selection of breakfast foods.

Their staff is also very nice and they serve quickly. The atmosphere there is very laid back and that's also another cool thing although the size of the place makes it very difficult to get a table sometimes and it does tend to also get pretty loud in there when its packed.... They are clean though, very clean. Great place! Go check it out for yourself.
