The Greenhouse is one of the best food options on campus.  Food is .44 cents per ounce, which is 2 cents less than over at whole foods, while they buy from the same providers, which makes their lettuce the best available.  I work at the greenhouse, and in all honesty, I have never seen a baked potato (which are in fact baked), come out to more than 2.75.  Their pre-made Specialty salads are a set price of 5.00, or 6.60 if you get an uber premium one.

Somebody mentioned earlier that they were charged .05 for a container for the bread roll and soup.  This is because they already provide a to-go soup cup with lid and paper bag for free, and a wax roll holder.  All the containers are made from recycled paper, corn, or potato, are are very expensive to offer. 

Let's compare cost.  Cost-wise, we beat out other "greasy food options".  If you get equal amounts of hot food from The Greenhouse and Panda Express, (e.g. 1 lb {2-item combo} box from Panda, and 1 lb of Pasta Primavera from the Greenhouse), you will pay 4.64 from Greenhouse, while paying 6.64 at Panda for the same amount.  The Large salad is 5.00, the soda is 1.50, and that means your friend got a Baked Potato with toppings that weighed over 2.2 lbs, approximately 10.00.  Your friend just doesn't know how to portion themselves.  For any normal person, the pricing and food sizes are perfect for a college budget.
