After having eaten at all of  the Wagamama locations in Boston multiple times, and having a great experience at all of them, I've decided to settle on 4 stars.  

They have almost everything I could want from a quasi-Asian fusion restaurant.  The atmosphere is school cafeteria meets Asian, somewhat thought out, but banal.  But, I generally don't go out for the atmosphere, and while Wagamama doesn't have a bad atmosphere, it feels like they're trying to be a higher end restaurant than they really are.

Taste is where they excel.  I've read a number of the other reviews and see that the average review thinks the taste is rather insipid.  I'll preface this, then, by saying that it was Wagamama where I really discovered soba, so I'll be the first to admit that I haven't had whatever really authentic soba is supposed to be.  Wagamama's soba is delicious, though, and has beaten out every other soba dish I've had in Boston.  I work in Chinatown and have tried at least 30 different attempts at soba in Chinatown, but all pale in comparison.  Wagamama's soba is plump, not overcooked, well seasoned, not at all dry, and the steak/salmon/chicken is always well marinated and perfectly cooked.  In contrast, the soba I get from more "authentic" restaurants is dry, bland, and both looks and tastes as though it has sat under a heat lamp for most of the day.  If that's what "authentic" is supposed to be, I'll stick with Wagamama.

There is a fair selection of alcohol and sides, as well.  Additionally, the waitstaff has always been prompt and the food is also prepared quickly.  I've eaten at the various Wagamama locations some 20-25 times thus far and have not yet had anything less than a good experience.

All of that said, the reason I'm going with four stars instead of five is that they are a little pricey for what they offer.  It feels as though they've used their Asian infused school cafeteria look to justify higher prices.  I'd eat there more often, but I can't afford to.
