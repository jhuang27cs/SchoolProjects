A perfect evening after studying or midterms:  1 twelve inch pastrami from good old 'buck-fiddy' (aka 'roll-inn'), and a dollar ice-cream sandwich from Diddy Reese.  

OK, so prices have gone up some in the past few years since departing my favorite college town, but prices are still relatively cheap (UCLA students don't have the luxury of USC parents paying for their tuition).

The mexican workers here are efficient, so tip them extra.  Heck it's so cheap, I usually end up paying double in tips.
