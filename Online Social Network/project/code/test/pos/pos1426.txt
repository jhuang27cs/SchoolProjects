I started going to Shear Madness to get my hair lighted and cut. The shop is a nice little place in the U-district. The staff is very friendly and they have a lot of fun while making you feel and look like a million bucks! 

I needed a job so I decided to go see Richelle. She used foil to highlight my hair and she is very detailed and talented. She gave me an amazing scalp massage during the shampoo and rinse. She cut my hair the way I asked and it was perfect. She waxed my eyebrows as well. 

The next day I walked into a little restaurant/bar to drop off my resume in Ballard. 3 hours later, I received a phone call from them and I was hired. 

Thanks to Richelle and Shear Madness for helping me land my job and get out of my brother's attic!  I love this place! My brother does too. =)
