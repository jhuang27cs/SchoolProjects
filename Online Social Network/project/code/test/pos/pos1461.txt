I've been to the lunch buffet a couple times, and I've always been satisfied.  You get a 10% student discount, and a 5% additional discount if you pay in cash-- so the lunch buffet came to approx $8.30!

It's best if you get there right when they open (around 11:30am), as the food sits out and gets less fresh later during the lunch period.  In general, though, the flavors are good and spicy, and I always leave satisfied.  

The staff is super helpful and nice- this is definitely a bang for your buck in University City!
