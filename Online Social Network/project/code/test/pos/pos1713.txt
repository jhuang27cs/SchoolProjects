I only get my stuff framed here - John's been at it for about 30 years and unlike some other stores, never tries to upsell for a fancier frame or several kinds of matting, but simply offers a variety of frames he think might go best, after you've said what you're thinking of to begin with. He always has good suggestions and carefully explains why he thinks one frame or another might be better, and I've seen some excellently unique custom jobs he's done. My framing jobs have always been ready when promised.  Even better: it's never expensive. Harvey Mudd trusts Stoutboy to frame their jillions of awards, and if supernerds think this is where it's at, why would you argue?

Besides framing, John has a great collection of rock posters and records (you can find him with these rarities at record shows around SoCal, too), and can get his hands on all sorts of stuff - which is how Jessica H. and I ended up with a WICKED AWESOME Stryper poster in our kitchen in 2001. A testament to John's excellence right there - seriously, if all business owners were as sweet and laid-back as John, the world would be an easier place to shop in.
