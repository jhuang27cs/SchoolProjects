I LOVE HAPPY HOUR. 

Beware, the line starts *early* - as in 4:30pm for the 5pm open. But it's well worth it if you want a booth. Otherwise, roll in a 5pm and you can generally get a stool at the bar.

The burgers are *awesome*. No need for fancy frills and sauces, the meat is seasoned perfectly, and the cheese and bacon is all the seasoning you need baby. 

Fries and fresh chips are great, and their small drink selection is solid. 

They have a few appetizer options for vegetarians, but I think the true draw is the burger. Especially, as others have said, considering how expensive this place is otherwise.
