Actually probably around 3.5 stars (docking the star for the pricing!).
Came here with a group of friends for lunch this past Sunday and enjoyed the El Camino Breakfast. Pretty substantial portion of food - my only complaint that it's pricey! The dessert beignets were also good (though no comparison to those in NOLA). 

Another plus is the location - Town & Country Square is kind of a nice place to wander around on a sunny weekend and there are plenty of other errands you can run after a nice meal @ Mayfield - there is a nice sized Trader Joe's next door and a Sur La Table for those who like to browse homewares like myself.
