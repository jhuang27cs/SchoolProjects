coming from out-of-town I'm really glad I went to "six feet under". Its the kind of place you want to go to when you visit a city. Local, interesting, fun and not too expensive. I recommend it.

I had the "6 Pepper Shrimp & Grits". I heard it was very spicy but it wasnt too bad. Probably 6 out of 10 spice. Its about as hot as an Indian dish. It was very good though (never had grits before).

For an appetizer i had the fried alligator bites which was great. I've had fried alligator before that just looked/tasted like calamari but "6 Feet Under"'s was big meaty chunks of alligator which tasted so much better. Loved it

Also had a bunch of oyster shots. You gotta do that. Slimy-ness with alcohol. Could do them all day.
