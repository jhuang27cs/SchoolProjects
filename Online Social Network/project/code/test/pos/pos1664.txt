I was in Ann Arbor this past weekend and actually went to Dominick's TWICE...that's how much I enjoyed the place. I actually thought the prices were decent...$13 for a quart of sangria seems like a good deal to me! Maybe that's because I'm used to paying like $5-6 a glass at all the tapas places in Chicago. In terms of food, I really enjoyed the penne with red pepper pesto, which was like $8 and came with a side salad and a hilarious serving of soup. (No really...it was in a teeny jelly jar and might have been 5 spoonfuls, tops!) Also tried the chicken quesadilla which was full of veggies and not greasy at all. 

Summer camp-style picnic tables outside were fun when it was sunny. Did not appreciate the insanely loud siren telling me to leave at 10:00, but hey, now I know what to expect for next time.
