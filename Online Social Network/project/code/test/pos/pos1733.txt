I had heard about Rolfing in the 70's but never tried it because I thought it might be to painful.  Now as a 72 year man, I got my courage up to try it.  I trusted Jed immediately and this trust grew with each session over a 3 month period.  Jed is sensitive, intuitive and very professional.  Yes there was some pain involved, but I found the deep pressure which is contrasted with Jed's very light touch brought about a profoundly relaxed state,  This relaxed state continued for days after the session.  I would recommend Jed to anyone who wishes a very professional Rolfing session.  I recommend the 10 session package in order to gain the full experience..
