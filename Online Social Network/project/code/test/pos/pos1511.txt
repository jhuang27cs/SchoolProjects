What a fabulous place - and it's more than just the ice cream that keeps me coming back.  The place is clean, the staff are great and know what they are doing, and one gets his food as quick as can be.  The people on the floor bus the tables quickly because they have to: usually, the place is filled with people.

A friend of mine who plays the organ at both a church and a synagogue near to there eats there so often, I kid her about paying their light bill every month.  But she goes there for a reason: good food served fast.  Not being a cook, that's exactly what she needs - and the staff know her by name.

I usually order the tuna melt, but most anything from there is great, though their chicken alfredo was a bit boring.  It's best to stick with the sandwiches, though their salad bar is very ample.

As for aesthetics, one feels as though they are entering a food experience rather than just an eating establishment.  And yes, the ice cream is very good indeed.
