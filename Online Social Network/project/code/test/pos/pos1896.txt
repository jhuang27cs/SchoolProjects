This place is comparable to Max Soha in the Morningside Heights region. 

However, it's got plenty of charm I bet is difficult to find in other parts of Manhattan. Cute place for a relaxed saturday lunch (especially in the summer), or a nice relaxed chill dinner with friends. Dates would work here too.

I personally love ordering the salads which are just nice fresh heaps of veggies. They layer the arugula on their garden salad, so you get that nice bite of vegetables that are crisp but also meaty when they're stacked together. Not too much dressing--just right.

The entrees are reasonably priced. I find myself wanting more. That maltagliati is hearty and warming. 

I miss when they had the mushroom and truffle oil risotto though. that stuff was gold & well priced.

Their specials are usually a hit.
