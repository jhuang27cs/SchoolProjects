JAFFA FOR LIFE!

I have yet to find a comporable chicken schwarma plate.  It is heavenly.  The falafels are not too dry, the pita is perfect, and the service is outstanding.

I think they should open one in SF and send Adam on up so I can see him more frequently and indulge in some amazing grub.  =)
