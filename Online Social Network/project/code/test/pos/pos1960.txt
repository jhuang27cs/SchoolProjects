Not bad not bad at all, went on a late sunday morning and it seemed it would be too busy to get us in and out fast. Just as we were walking out the door an older gentlemen ushered us in and right to a seat. The cash only sign almost scared us off. 

Anyway food is typical diner food I had a bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich and it was fine for the price 5.85 with home fries. Waitresses were very attenative with coffee and water refills and brought us our food quickly. You can't always get nice service in busy places so that was a big plus. 

I can tell this has been Pittsburgh oldie for a while, its not a new age vegan vegetarian friendly joint. although several vegetarian options (with egg) on the omelette portion of breakfast menu. Also several greek american type salads and dishes (gyros) if you're into that. 

If you're looking for a cheap greasy nostalgia this is it, if you're seeking a spectacular garlic potato, red roasted peper and asiago cheese omelette you're not gonna find it here. I liked the people owner and wait staff and food is decent so I gave it four. Sometimes you have to know what you came for and just be happy with that :)
