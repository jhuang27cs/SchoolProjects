My friend and I had lunch here on a Tuesday afternoon. Not packed. Most of their baked goods were still available.

We had their egg salad open-faced sandwich since it's much talked about and I liked it. I have no idea how many eggs I consumed in one sitting, but it was satisfying. The sandwich isn't fancy, there aren't any palate surprisers, it's just simple egg salad on toasted bread. I had it on their rosemary currant bread which I became instantly addicted to.

I bought a bunch of their cookies for my friend and myself. We tried their macarons - good texture and buttercream (sea salt caramel is by far my most favourite) The macarons are $1.65 each and are about 2" in diameter.

I returned to Euro Pane to buy more bread and pastries. I purchased a loaf of their rosemary currant, two cinnamon rolls, a lemon bar, 12 macarons. My total was $32 even. I have no idea what anything costs there besides their lunch items and the macarons. I wish they'd post prices..

Berry tea (iced tea) tasted like cherry cough syrup. :(

The ladies working the counter are super friendly. I will most definitely return!!
