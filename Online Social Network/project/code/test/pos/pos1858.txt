Loved how open and bright the bakery was.  Lots of seating.  Good local foods selection.  Split two of their farm to table selections:  upstate ban mhi & Eddie's free bird.  Both bursting with juicy meat and fresh veggies.  Excellent!  Friendly service as well.  Would be 5 stars were it not for the fact that none of the breads are 100 % whole grain.  Would love to have at least one selection that is.  Still, you know I'll be back.
