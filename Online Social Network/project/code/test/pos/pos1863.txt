The breakfast was out of this world! Incredibly good fried roll with scrambled eggs, bacon, spicy sauce, bits of yummy marinated veggies. Not to mention the side with pico, roasted potatos, and little discs of what I have to think were fried grits. All I can say is WOW - that's the most satisfying breakfast I've had in a long time. Thanks Lees!
