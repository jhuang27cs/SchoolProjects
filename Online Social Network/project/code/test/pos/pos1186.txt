This cupcake shop is actually inside the Coldstone's Creamery. At first, I though Coldstone's decided to sell cupcakes, but I think the two businesses just share the venue. We went to Coldstone's for dessert and decided to get some cupcakes, too. It was after dinner, so they had these last-chance specials - 2 for $3. Normally, each cupcake is $2.50, so the late-night prices are quite a steal. I got the red velvet one and Alex A. got the dulce de leche one. They all had very cute names, but I've forgotten them! I think for day-old cupcakes (assuming they were made that morning), they were pretty good. They were regular-sized - not like the giant cupcakes that's trending around California. It wasn't too sweet, but they still had a hefty dollop of icing on top that really added to the flavor of the cupcake. They even sell milk for $0.50. Overall, it's a pretty cute cupcake stand and definitely something to check out if you're in the mood for sweets!
