Everyone says eat at Hoagie Haven right next door, but the locals know George's does hot sandwiches much better. They use better quality ingredients and only cost a tinnnny bit more. Whenever I am home in Princeton I make sure to get a Buffalo Chicken Cheesesteak. It may be one of the greatest things I've ever had. Back in senior year of high school I used to eat here almost every day for lunch.

 The only negative is that they close a lot earlier than Hoagie Haven.
