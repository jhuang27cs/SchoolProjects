I like this store.  I can't believe it got bad reviews.  It is exceptionally clean (I went on a weekday evening so maybe it's not the norm) and well organized.  They have a decent amount of "exotic" foods like pomegranates and such.   Everything was very clean, just the way I like it.  Hoorah!  

It's reasonably priced for a city grocery store.
