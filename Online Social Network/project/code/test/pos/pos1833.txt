While a little pricey, Julep is a great place to bring friends.  I recently with with a couple friends.  We loved the fact that we could all sit together and that the staff really encouraged us to relax and that we didn't have to rush after we were done with our pedicures.  The massage was one of the best I've ever had with a pedicure.  

Others have complained that Julep doesn't have a ton of colors, but I think they had about 20 - 25 when I went, which was plenty.  The paint is non-toxic so Julep really doesn't smell like a traditional nail place which I also loved.  Also, my paint last for a good 3 1/2 weeks without chipping or looking bad.

Julep is a place I will be going back to!
