Thank god I don't live in Atlanta anymore!  If I did, I'd need one of those electric scooters because my legs wouldn't support my body.  My friend and I went to Sublime Saturday morning.  We bought a dozen assorted doughnuts.  We went back to our hotel to help our husbands pack up the room and split them up for home.  They were all gone by the time we finished packing.  15 minutes tops.  Absolutely the best and most creative doughnuts I've had.  We all give it 2 thumbs up and will definitely be back when we return to the ATL.  BTW, my fave was the A-Town.
