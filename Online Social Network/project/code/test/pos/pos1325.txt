I didnt have high expectations, because it was one of those fixed price menus for new years eve and its a hotel restaurant. But I was impressed with the food. Lets go course by course:

1. The first course was a wild mushroom soup served in an espresso cup. It was rich and amazing - there was good reason for the small portion though with all the food to come. 

2. Seared scallops with polenta. Yum. The scallops were huge and tender. I ate every bite of it. 

3. The next dish was a truffle oil rissoto with truffles on top. It was incredible. I can't even do it justice to try and explain how good it was. 

4. Melon soup. I didnt touch it. I don't like eating anything sweet in between a savory meal. 

5. Steak. Because its New Years of course. The steak was good but not incredible. It was a tri tip cut and not so lean. The portion was too huge  - especially at this point of the meal. I should have ordered the Duck.....

6. Brownie and ice cream. I didnt have room for dessert by this time but the one bite of this I had was very very good. The brownie had a layer of mouse in it. Very rich and moist. 

The bill was a lot. I can't say this place is a good deal. But - it was new years eve. I think for a special occasion I would come back here. By the end of the meal my tight tight dress was very hard to breathe in.
