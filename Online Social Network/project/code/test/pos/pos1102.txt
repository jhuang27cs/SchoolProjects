I think the Cambridge Center takes a bit of a back seat to it's bigger colleague, the Boston Center.  That's a shame.  The CCAE is a lovely place.  They offer lots of great classes and have a funky, laid back feel even while being well organized and thorough.
I've been around the Center for my whole life.  My parents have volunteered there for as long as I can remember, I have taken classes, my kids have taken classes, and most recently I've even done some teaching there myself.
I think maybe the center has a bit of a reputation of being stodgy or for old people, but that is really not the case, and I totally suggest checking out the catalog at www.ccae.org
