The first time I walked in to buy a bottle of wine, I was a little put off by the staff. Three of them were huddled by the cash register talking about spirit animals; crows and ravens in Central Park as I wandered around in a complete haze of confusion. I quickly grabbed a bottle of white and left.

I decided to give it another chance, so I went again and again, and again. I haven't seen "spirit animal" woman again, but I have met the owner and other staff members. They're all friendly, very knowlegeable and eager to talk wine, teach wine and learn about wine. I had been to an event and had Polo Roger champagne, never heard of it before.

When I went into the store to pick up a bottle of Granacha, I bought a bottle of Mirone $9.99, very well balanced with a hint of dark cherries, I mentioned the champagne to the owner. Next thing I know, he's googling it up and we're chatting away about different champagnes. Now that's service.

They have deals on cases of wine, they have boutique wines, some tried and true wines and there's always a tasting going on.

If you go to their website, they have a list of wines that they carry. They'll also special  order wines for you and have free delivery.
