I have a feeling that i'm going to make a habit out of the weekend morning Premiership soccer breakfast.  Cheap English/Irish-type breakfast food and immaculate pints of Guinness poured at what many would consider an hour for only true degenerates to drink.  Big screens showing one or more games, jerseys of all colors singing and shouting and heckling and trashing the other side.  All in good fun, of course.  Having been to a real soccer match in England, it's not quite the same (it's less profane, from what I could tell, but not by any means PG-rated), but it's an awfully convenient dose of it which I'll certainly be back for more of.
