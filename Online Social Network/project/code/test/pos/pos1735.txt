New China Express is amazing. Despite what the emptiness of the restaurant may imply, whatever you get there will be delicious & probably some of the best Chinese that you will find in the U District.

It's cheap. You can get a large lunch meal for under $7, and dinner for only a tiny bit more. And since there typically aren't many people in the restaurant, the service is extremely quick. I've never experienced any sort of long wait here.

The food is well made. I've never disliked anything I've ordered. 

The best part... it's open til 1:30am every day of the week, AND they will deliver (w/ $15 minimum purchase, of course). This Chinese is a much better drunk food choice then Jack in the Box/Memo's. 

I'm a huge fan, and love introducing this little unknown place to friends as broke as me looking for some good food.
