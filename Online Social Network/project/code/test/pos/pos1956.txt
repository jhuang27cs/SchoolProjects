I can't comment on the atmosphere in Europane as I always get my items on the go. It always seems to be packed in there with all sorts. 

I've tried every sandwich on the menu now with almost every bread combination. My favorites are meatloaf, veggie & egg salad-- and my favorite bread, Olive.  All the other sammies are good, just not as spectacular as those three. I also buy their freshly baked bread by the loaf on a weekly basis.  
In regards to pastries, I'll just say this-- once I've tried something, any other version of it becomes somehow unnacceptable. It doesn't taste like "the real deal" anywhere else! {sigh}
Europane is single-handedly responsible for making me feel like I should be eating dessert on a regular basis these days...
