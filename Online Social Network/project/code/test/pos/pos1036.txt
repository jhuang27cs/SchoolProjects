On my quest to find the perfect crepe in a 10 block radius of my workplace, I was anxious to try out this creperie.  Having experienced a horrible faux-crepe @ Artopolis the day before, my spirits were down.  I read about the wait, the service time, etc. and wondered to myself if my measly one hour lunch break would be sufficient.  Luckily, I take a late lunch (2-3pm) and was pleased when my girlfriend and I were able to take a seat in their humble dining room with only one other couple mid-lunch.  Service was quick - we ordered the goat cheese/ratatouille crepe and the goat cheese/carmelized onions/mushroom crepe.  Both were served with a side of greens with balsamic.  Both were delicious (although we both preferred the ratatouille version) and balanced.  The portion was big enough to split, if one was planning on having a sweet crepe after.  We splurged and tried the basic Nutella crepe for dessert.  Delicious, crisp edges, perfect amount of Nutella.  (Although, if you're like me, you'll remember to ask them to hold the confectioners sugar next time).  The service was on par and courteous.  The only unusual thing was the techno beats playing overhead.  Il faut y aller!
