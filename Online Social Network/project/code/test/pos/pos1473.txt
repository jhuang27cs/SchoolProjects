Been coming here since I was in college.  One of my favorite hole in the walls.  It's cheap and good.  what more does a college student need?

I will go out of my way to come here - especially if I'm in town.  Like yesterday - drove here from Beverly Hills before heading back home to the SGV.

I know that the owners have changed hands since I've been coming here - because curiously they added Korean BBQ to the mix, which was a bit odd.

Being that I usually don't ever pass up Korean BBQ if it's on a menu somewhere, I *still* have not tried it here....Because I always get the spicy chicken.  Oh so yummy.

Their Teriyaki beef and chicken is pretty good as well - but hands down - I will usually get the spicy chicken - or perhaps in combo with the teri chicken or beef.  

Each plate comes with fried rice, salad, and 2 gyozas with the meat of your choice.  All for around 7 bucks.

There is plenty of seating.  But be forewarned - lunch time during the week or even dinner time during the week - can be packed due to all the students from UCLA and people that work in the office buildings around Westwood.

Parking is a bitch.  I'm not going to lie.  good luck trying to find street parking.  It's Westwood and it's metered.  Luckily - up the street - with the new trader joes and restuarants opening - there is now a garage that is closer by than some of the other garages in the area.
