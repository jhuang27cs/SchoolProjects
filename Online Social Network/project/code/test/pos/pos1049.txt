Hamlet has an AMAZING happy hour!!!  Their Mojitos and Margaritas are awesome & half price!!  The appetizers are also pretty tasty & they are half off as well!!  We got the sampler & calamari..yummy!  Sometimes the servers are a bit slow, but that's cool.  I expect them to be busy, and since i'm paying half price, i'm definitely not gonna be the douche that wants 10 star service!!  i Love it, plus it's close to my house!!
