Whole Foods!  Sometimes you intimidate me.  You are soooooo big and parking can be difficult during certain hours, but you do have really cool stuff.  I like your tea selection.  It, like you, is big!

I also like your produce selection -- who cares if it's not in season and probably won't taste good and is so small?  Let's charge 6 dollars a pound for it anyway!  

I like your deli area and your cheese display.  But I don't really like the skin-body area -- it's probably just me, since I grew up around girls who lOooOoved Bath&Body works, the fragrances that are in the shampoos/body lotions/body washes/candles just don't appeal to me.  They always seem to have an abundance of lavender, which I don't really like.  

I do love how your produce is shipped from nearby farms, though.  I always feel like those taste better than ones that are picked before they're ripe and are shipped in huuuuuuuuuuuge quantities from somewhere farther.  

I've never eaten at the deli -- I think it may be because the food's never appealed to me THAT much to the point that it becomes irresistible, and also because there's always a huuuuuge line and a bunch of people surrounding the deli.  

Anyway -- Whole Foods is fun to browse around in!  There are a ton of vegan, raw, gluten-free (etc.) products to suit each and every lifestyle!
