Mmmmmmmmmmmmm Shortstop is soooooo good. That crunchy bread, the cheesey, gooey mess of pepperoni and tomato sauce. So many great choices for different sandwiches. The garlic bread they give you the sandwiches on are amazing.

79 cent sodas are a HUGE plus. The sandwiches themselves are a little pricey, def more than your 5 dollar footlong from subway, but subway could never taste like this. 

Watch out for the grease, it goes right through the paper bags. I got some on my jeans last time :(

Sui, Pmp, all good. If you don't know what I'm talking about, hurry up and get your butts to Shortstop.
