Great food, nice ambiance, friendly staff with reasonable prices. This is one of my favorite dinner spot in Pasadena to meet up with friends for meal + coffee.

Here are some dishes I have tried and would strongly recommend:
1) "Johnny style" Abricott Burger with pork belly and Kim Chi
2) Trout Amandine
3) Spicy Pork Belly Sandwich
4) Mussel Soup
5) Iron Skirt Steak
6) Pork Belly with Red Cabbage

Also, make sure to try out their coffee deserts too :)
