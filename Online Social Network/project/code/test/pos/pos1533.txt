this location is the best of all the local to me locations.  i've noticed that they've got more sales selections in clothing and accessories, plus they are ultra organized and sincerely more friendly than other anthro sa's encountered!
the best section of this store has got to be the front far right of the store:  books galore!  again, more books and stationery variety than all the other anthropologies i frequent, even beating out santana row and san francisco.  carmel's anthropologie doesn't count though because it's not local to me, and anyway, carmel is my all time FAVORITE anthropologie.

i still have and wear this deletta rosette tank from this anthro location that i've only seen online.  i tried looking for it at the santana row and SF location to no avail.  guess they've got better buyers and/or shipment at palo alto.  

5 stars to them all the way for customer service, sales selections, display, variety of books and the store in its entirety.
