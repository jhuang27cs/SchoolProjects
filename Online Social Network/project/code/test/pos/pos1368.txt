My parents were in Berkeley some 30+ years ago, and when I was growing up we'd often go to Berkeley and wind up at Top Dog. I think this was part of their plan to brainwash me into going to Berkeley, or maybe they just missed Top Dog. 

In any case, I wound up going to Berkeley and got a CS degree fueled by Top Dog (and Bongo Burger), so it worked. And now I miss them both. :(
