Disclaimer: I've done SAT prep for Kaplan since 2001.

Now that that's out of the way, let me tell you why this place rocks.  The office staff is friendly and they know what they're talking about.  The methods are sensible (not full of tricks/gimmicks) and based on things students have already encountered in school.  They offer a money-back guarantee on some programs.  They update their books every single year, if not more often.  There are online resources, video resources, and all kinds of classes for nearly every standardized test out there.

SAT-specific reasons: every tutor has to score in the 95th percentile or above to work at this location, undergo 16 hours of supervised training, and pass an extreme training gauntlet.  I've seen dramatic score increases from most of my students, which is the biggest reason I've continued to work here.

I rarely see any grumpy faces leaving the Kaplan center, so I figure they're doing something right.  The center is always full, too - I know some students just come here to study because they like the environment.
