I have been seeing Dr. Anfang off and on over many years. Her superb chiropractic knowledge, compassion and skill have saved my neck (and back) over and over. Unlike other doctors' offices, Anfang Chiropractic never keeps me waiting for my appointments and is always able to work with my schedule. Kathy is friendly and efficient and makes going there a pleasure. But best of all is knowing that I will always get the very best care and an interested, involved and highly skilled practitioner. Plus, she loves my corny jokes.
