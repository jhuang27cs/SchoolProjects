Pretty decent sandwiches but stay away from their Turkey meat.  Both times I tried their turkey sandwich, I felt that the meat was probably previously frozen.  The meat had a very odd texture to it and sort of just fell apart instead of having any sort of tear or resistance.  Anyway, I like how they load up the sandwiches with alfalfa sprouts and big slices of tomato!  The bread here isn't that good either.  Now that I think of it, I prefer subway over sandwich island but its good to change it up a bit.  This place is a good alternative to a gross greasy lunch at UV.
