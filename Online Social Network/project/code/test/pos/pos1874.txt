the best coffee bar in this town

i've become somewhat of a regular at this place since they opened. the few times we had the espresso, it is quite well made here. i do have to say, tho, that their regular coffee (pour over/iced) have gone a bit watery. when they first opened, and the first few times i went, their pour over coffee was simply amazing. thick, black, strong, i could taste so much flavor; the only place that made as strong and good regular coffee is peet's. what was amazing was that the iced coffee was the same, just as strong, just a thick, just as flavorful. recently, however, they seemed to have lowered their coffee-to-water ratio, at least for the cheapest pour over coffee. i still love going there, and i still think they're the best in town. another sign that they're the real deal? they have simple syrup. their mocha is excellent. i like the small size, and the chocolate they use is actually chocolate, not chocolate flavored sugar syrup. i think they might even make their own chocolate syrup. it also is always beautifully poured. it could use more espresso; they tend to go a bit lite on coffee for a serious coffee bar. there was one time when i ordered a capp and they gave me what was essentially a latte (often-committed mistake in any regular coffee shop). a beautifully poured latte, but not a capp. still, this is the best coffee bar in town. it's pricey, but it's the best. want soy latte? go to starbucks. want real coffee? come here. rival? zingerman's coffee shop, not the one by the deli, but at their roasting location. zingerman's beans aren't always consistently good tho, whereas comet's almost always gets good beans
