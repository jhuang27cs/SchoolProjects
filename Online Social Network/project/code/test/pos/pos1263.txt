Extremely knowledgable, great selection - Customer service is even better!  I was in Slo twice in the last 6 months and both times I needed parts for my Blur and directions to trails.  

Someone greeted me immediately when I walked in - knew exactly what I wanted and talked to me for a bit about different parts.  They also printed directions to the trail that I was going to ride.

These guys were great!  Appreciate the service.
