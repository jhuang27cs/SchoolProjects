OMG!  i havne't been to this one but i remember when there was a lamonica's in old town pas!!  but then the big corporate, commercial monsters came in and lamonica's was gobbled up in two bites!!  well, i'm assuming that's what happened--if memory serves me right, pacsun is now where it was standing. 

great place for a quick pizza fix or if you're just in a hurry and dont need a sit down meal.  large, thin, new york style pie slices at very affordable prices.  i remember when it was in pas, prices were going for sumpin like $1.75.  and, yes, usually they're already made.  they cut you a slice and just heat it up in their oven but it still tastes great.  add some extra oregano on it and i was good to go.  heh...i'm reminiscing here.  there was also one time when i was there with some friends and we guessed all the celebs in the mural that's on their wall (wonder if they got one in westwood?) and after some coaxing they gave us a free slice or sumpin...good times.

i definitely will have to stop by here and have a lamonica's reunion.
