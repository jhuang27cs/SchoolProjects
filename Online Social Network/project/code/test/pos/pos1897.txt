Let me begin by saying that I lived in Ethiopia for a few months a few years ago. I've been pining for Ethiopian food for months. Finally I got a friend to come with me. Awash is only about 10 blocks from my apartment, which to me is close! 

Awash is in a nice Harlem neigborhood. When my friend and I arrived it was about half full. But by the time we left it was full up. The menu is pretty big, with lots of different choices. The ordering was quick, we got vegetable sambusas to share for the appetizer. I got the vegetarian combo, and my friend got the combination #1. I also ordered a virgin bloody mary. 

The service between the time of ordering and actually getting the food was pretty slow. But it's okay, we had time to chat.

The appetizer came with three sambusas, which are little pastries made with filo dough and stuffed with some green vegetables. They were pretty good. There were only 3, which is the right amount for an appetizer. My combo was wonderful! Even in Ethiopia I don't remember anything with such variety. The veggie combo has 2 kinds of lentils, potatoes, beets, collard greens, chickpeas, carrots. My drink was nice and spicey (a tad bit too much so) but a good change from just the regular tomato juice. My friend was not so impressed with her meal. She did like the lentils bit, and liked the tibs wat (beef). 

Their dessert section leaves something to be desired, so we went elsewhere. The price is pretty good there, and they deliver (hopefully to my house too). The waitress was pretty attentive, especially with the water. She made some good suggestions for my friend. The combinations are pretty large, almost enough for 2 people each. I did get to take some injera home.

All in all, I like it a lot! I'll return here if I can get someone else to come with me!

Vegan friendly!
