YUMMYLICIOUS! :) :)
I do believe this is the best part about college park downtown..!!

INTERIOR Awesomely cool and chic!

STAFF: Very friendly! :) and tastings are FREE! :p

FLAVORS: Awesome as ever! I am in love with litchee, and I will have nothing but that! But I do like green apple and original too!

TOPPINGS : wide range and variety, most fruits are fresh and not frozen/canned etc. I love the fact that they are usually well stocked with Mochi, fresh blackberries and Coconut jelly cubes (I love these :p ). The strawberries, mangoes and blueberries taste amazing!

DOWNSIDE: They DO NOT accept credit cards. Sigh. I always have to make a dash for the nearest ATM (BOA and Chevy chase are right  outside though :p)

And there is something about their smoothies, even though they literally BLEND all your ingredients into pulp for the smoothie, I can still taste every flavor/topping distinctly in my smoothie! By far the BESTEST part! :p

My favorite combinations: Try Litchee and non fat original. Top it with coconut jelly, mochi, strawberries and blackberries. Add choco chips..yuummm yuumm yuummmm!! :) :)

Green Apple with Kiwi fruit and chocochips.. another heavenly combination!

Last but not the least, my SECRET funda- Take  a bit of yogurt, add fruits, then add more yogurt and finally add the dry toppings (choco chips, nuts etc. tastes WAYYYY better than just one dollop of yogurt topped with toppings! :) :) The layers  add so much more fun! :)
