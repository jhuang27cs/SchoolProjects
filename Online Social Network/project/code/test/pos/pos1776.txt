I'll be honest with you. I have passed by this place numerous times and having read the Yelp reviews, stayed away. Based on some of the reviews, I would have expected Yellow Warning Tape outside with Hepatitis C literature.

well, last week, the world aligned and I found myself hungry and comparing the cost of a $7 wrap over on Durant vs all you can eat for just about the same price?..it became a no-brainer.

one of barometers for Indian food and especially their buffetts is the AR test, or the Acid Reflux test. you know when you begin to burp up stomach acid? gross yes, but all too common at many a Indian buffet. 

I knew the potential here, stuff my face and end up heaving bloody puke in the toilet 2 hours later. .......After eating here, I am happy to say I am here and have not had to check into my local ER.

The food here while not the best, there was some pretty bright moments. Most of the stuff was poorly labled, but out of the 6 or so choices, I would say 2-3 were really good and memorbable. 

Was it pretty dirty? kinda, hey it is berkeley and telegraph ave and you have your mix of students, local weirdos, plus it is Indian food.....I did take a quick glace into the kitchen and really would have preffered not to......but all in all, I would feel safe to return.
