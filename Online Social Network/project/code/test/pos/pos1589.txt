very straight forward guy
estimates are very close to the actual price
good workmanship
slightly higher labor fees than what I am used to in a big metro area

The place looks shabby, the whole place looks like its going to collapse, but do not let that scare you off
He has a pretty good workshop inside.

He straight to the point, very accommodating to requests and immediately completes the work if anything is pointed out. He even tells if you a procedure is not needed at this time. That is a big plus in my book. We rely on experts to tell us what is needed and what is not. It was a very pleasant experience to see that he does not "recommend" a work when its not needed.

He doesnt seem very friendly at first sight but as long as he is not trying to rip me off and does a good job, hey, I will go back there again.

I highly recommend.
