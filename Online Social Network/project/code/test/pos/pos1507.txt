VEGETARIAN REVIEW:

Come here for happy hour!!  Around 5, grab a friend and head upstairs to their swanky-ish lounge for seriously reasonably priced ample amounts of food.

$6 for cocktails, $5 for wine, $2.50 for Southern Star
$6 for an appetizer from a selected list.
The prices aren't mind-blowing, kinda my ceiling on what I'd pay for lunch somewhere, but I was surprised to get a full plate of food and not just a few teeny bites like a number of other places I've been.

The Agadashi Tofu is OUTSTANDING!  I would stop in by myself and skip the drink just for this tofu.  Perfectly crisp and firm tofu in a delicious sauce with bok choy-- it was a ton of food for $6

A friend and I shared the Margherita Pizza as well, also delicious and about the size of a medium pizza, 6 slices per pizza.

The Citrus Blossom cocktail was fabulous, tingly and grapefruity.
Plus the waitress was nice, it wasn't crazy crowded, and it's a nice little place to spend a few hours of happiness.

In sum, awesome and ample veg fare plus juicy cocktails mean I'll be back no doubt.
