I've had pretty good experiences here in the past and recently came by towards the end of a Friday HH.... and found it almost completely packed. I was pretty surprised and glad that two of our friends were late, because there weren't any tables open when we got there (so we sat at the bar).

The service was great. We were in a hurry because we had plans to see a movie about 45 minutes (after the late friends arrived), so we mentioned it to a server. About 15 minutes later another staff member came by and checked in to make sure we're still on track for getting to our movie on time. The staff actually communicates!?! This is kind of amazing!

HH deals.... eh. They're alright. Food-wise you're kind of limited because they only had two options of wings, chili cheese fries, (three) mini burgers, and their junkyard dog. It was pretty tasty, but each food item cost $5 and that didn't really feel like a great deal. The HH beer specials give you a choice of the daily micro or the daily German... and they were so-so on that day. I learned that I'm not a Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale kind of girl.

I'd give Shultzy's a 3.5 if I could. This is a tough one... but, it's been flavorful and service has been good, so.... I think a 4 sounds better.

Random tid-bit: One time I saw a woman walking out of there with her ~13 year old sons and saying "If you go to UW, you are not going to eat here! This place is WAY out of your budget!" I was kind of sad to hear she was putting such limitations on what they should expect to amount to.
