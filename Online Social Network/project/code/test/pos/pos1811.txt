Thank god, finally a good old fashioned barber shop that knows how to give me the cut I want at a price that doesn't make me cringe.

Back when I wore a beard, this was one of the few places in town where I could go for a shave/trim and have them do a great job at it.

Now, I just keep my hair cut *very* short - like, a 1 on the clipper, and while most of the younger barbers at the other shops ignore me and barely take the hair down at all, these guys listen and take it right down (A good thing because it grows like kudzu everywhere other than on top :)

Good prices, great service, and a friendly staff with great old fashioned atmosphere make this my favorite barber shop in Boston bar none.
