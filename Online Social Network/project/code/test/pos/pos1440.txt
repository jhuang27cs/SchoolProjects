NOM!

I went here for brunch and it was soooo mouthwateringly delicious!

First off, get the donuts. Just do it. Worry about the carbs later. Lemon, chocolate, and maple topped on some of the most perfect donut cake batter I've ever had. They even get better when they're cold! (I mean, if you can take that long to eat them)

I had the mushroom, bacon, tomato omelet with a side of grits. The grits were fantastic, I didn't need to add butter or salt (however I did add a little hot sauce cause that's how I roll)! The omelet, well, was an omelet. A little greasy, but it's brunch and I did need something to soak up all that alcohol I had the night before. My friend had the special fish & chips, which were breaded and cooked to perfection. Crispy and crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Outside of England, I'm not sure I've had such good fried fish.

The wait staff was alright, and probably my only reason for not giving them 5 stars. He wasn't really attentive, seeing as I think my friend and I were the only two people in his section for awhile. Both groups of people that sat down after us received their food before we even got our appetizers (donuts). He never came back to refill my coffee and really didn't take any initiative to ask us how everything was. I'm sure he had a wild Saturday night too, but still, I want mah food.

Don't let the waitstaff deter you from trying the food. At least once. Show up at least once. Then decide for yourself.
