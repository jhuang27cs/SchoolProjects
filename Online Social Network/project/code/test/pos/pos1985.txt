I started going to Cristina back when she was working at Benefit and I've followed her to her new place in Westwood.  She's amazing.  I never let anyone wax my eyebrows before because I'm so particular.  I didn't realize what I was missing--Cristina does such a great job.  My face looks prettier and more polished, but my brows are such a natural shape that you wouldn't know I get them done.  That's what I love about Cristina--she actually listens to what I want.

As for bikini waxes, I've been to so many people I couldn't list them.  I've gone to expensive salons and the cheap places on Westwood Blvd.  Cristina is by far the best.  She never leaves any strays and she uses some special kind of wax or technique that doesn't hurt.  I couldn't imagine using anyone else now!

I haven't gotten a facial from her yet, but I have been using the products she recommended for my skin.  They've helped my problem skin clear up and nearly eliminated shine and dry skin.  I've never gotten a facial from anyone before but I want to try Cristina.  I'll review that after I go.
