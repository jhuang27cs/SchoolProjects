Dog Haus has the best burgers I have ever tried!  The Hawaiin bread makes for a truly unique taste.  Their angus chuck is mouth watering and just melts in your mouth.  Must haves from Dog Haus are the Little Mule, Ringer, and the Old Town Dog.  I dont even like hot dogs but the ones here are just amazing.  I usually get the sausage instead of the traditional dog.  All in all, this is one place that everyone in the Pasadena area should try.  Even if you dont live here, come out and have their food.  I'm pretty sure they will be a very big franchise in the future!
