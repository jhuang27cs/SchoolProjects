This is my new favourite place to hit after brushing up my knitting skills. I came in here and bought a hank. Now I have never been taught how to use the spinner (hell I don't even know the appropriate name...), there were enough staff at a late hour to help me and keep an eye on me before I destroyed my newly bought yarn (kidding, but who knows sometimes..). They have such a great selection and some really good prices. I would also definitely recommend the bargain bins which have some really amazing prices
