I was visiting a friend in SLO and wanted something that wasn't pizza or burgers. We had planned on going to Jaffa because the reviews are so much better. By the time we got there, Jaffa had already closed, so we reluctantly went to Petra.

The man that greeted us was very nice. Even though my friend told him he had eaten there before, he still gave us some free fresh pita bread. I got the chicken schwarma, and was very satisfied. It was good tasting and easily enough to fill me up. Everyone else was happy with their food as well. Towards the end of our meal the old man gave us all free fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. 

All in all, the food was pretty good, the pita was some of the best I've ever had, and we got FREE food to go with our meal. I haven't been to Jaffa yet, so I can't compare, but I was VERY happy with Petra. Don't knock it 'till you try it.
