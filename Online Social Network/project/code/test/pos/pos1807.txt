So I went to Hudson Lounge, maybe 2 weeks ago and I loved it, I was thoroughly impressed with the lounge itself and the service. Anthony the event coordinator is a doll and he really knows the meaning of customer service. I went with a few of my friends, and it was their first time going as well, they were happy with the service, the drinks and the dance floor. Anything you have heard about Hudson Lounge is not necessarily true, I went to make a decision for myself about whether or not it would be a place I would patronize in the future and I must say that this will definitely be a go to spot.
