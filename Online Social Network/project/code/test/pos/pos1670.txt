had the ivy leage, blue moon, regular, and sweet potato fries. 

The meat itself was juicy and tasty, and the toppings (especially crumbled blue and fried onion strings!) were really good. Although I was at first suspicious that the fries would taste burnt from being cooked in olive oil, they turned out to be excellent (maybe they use a blend? I dont care).  

Overall a decent burger with good toppings, and a good value considering that they are supposedly locally sources, grass fed, hormone free etc. I would go back, and it'd be nice to try their breakfast foods or other sandwiches.
