Great hummus, great pastries (I'm a fan of their scones) and I just tried an excellent baba ganoush. Also a lovely atmosphere and environment; discovering the outdoor second floor deck was such a lovely and unexpected surprise. 

Slight drawback: For the quantity of food most of the items strike me as slightly overpriced.
