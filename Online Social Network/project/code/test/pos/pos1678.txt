If you happen to be in the area of USC don't waste your time with the fast food Giants come check out this independent burger joint!, with a large menu selection and good prices and pretty good food nothing 5-Star but I think above average.

Today I'm hitting them up for a Breakfast Burrito http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sAf2xtvoAzDAyWq3YO11Cg?select=RBiyRumvjN_8816k9ofAEg they make it with Bacon & Sausage, eggs, hash browns, and cheese, they also have a pretty good salsa http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sAf2xtvoAzDAyWq3YO11Cg?select=3VutnYu5yOK4nX427Vg0aw the burrito is considerably smaller than others though they are generous with the meat (Bacon & Sausage) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sAf2xtvoAzDAyWq3YO11Cg?select=49nw83RugLx8WRwwaGH8UA and has a nice balance of eggs, hash browns and with the salsa it's a very good burrito, though I must deduct .5-Star for the smaller size. 3.5-Stars
