Just enjoyed a pleasurable lunch at Smith & Wollensky on the square.  The upstairs area always provides a great view of Rittenhouse, and on a day breaking nearly 100 degrees out, a glass of Sauvignon and a view of the park was exactly what I was greatly in need of. 

Had the chef's recommendation of a mango lobster salad with fresh chopped greens and a healthy portion of fresh lobster tail on top.  A perfectly refreshing summer lunch option.  Paired with a glass of white, it unquestionably hit the spot.
