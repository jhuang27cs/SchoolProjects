I can't even express the cool factor of this place. It really was a great B&B but the greatest part of our stay here was the evening walk around the neighborhood. I met some super nice people, talked about everything you could imagine, ate some delectable foods. and completely loved the whole atmosphere of it all. 

We stayed in a great little 2 bedroom room that was more like a condo than a "room". Than hung out with some of the other guests and watched our daughter eat up the beautiful outdoor gardens. Topped that off with a great breakfast hosted by the nicest servers you could ever meet. I can't wait to visit again. Thank you CN for an unforgettable weekend! See you again soon!
