I've been getting smoothies from Ben the smoothie guy since I was in middle school. It has been years and I go infrequently, but each time he remembers to ask about school and the latest boy. And OH my god. The smoothies. I always get a twist on the pina coloda (which is just fresh pineapple juice and coconut milk). Blueberry peach pina coloda. Strawberry pina coloda. Delicious delicious. I have tried to make them at home, what is it like, four ingredients?, and I have not been able to do them justice. Only explanation: Ben is magic.
