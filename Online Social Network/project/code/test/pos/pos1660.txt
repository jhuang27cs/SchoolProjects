Good luck finding any place in the world with more expensive pizza.  Having said that, it's completely worth it!

I have had some not-so-good pizza here, but that's more about personal taste preferences -- they have incredible ingredients (mostly organic), incredible combinations (love the arugula pizza, the brie pizza, and the truffle pizza!), and very friendly staff.  

I've gotten to the point that I'll settle for their competitors (Cottage Inn and Pizza House do make good 'za, after all), but if it's up to me, we're getting Silvio's every time.
