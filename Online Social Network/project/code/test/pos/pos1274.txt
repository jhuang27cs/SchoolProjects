I really like this little shop despite the ridiculous prices (an artist needs to make money somehow, right?). 

A lot of the stuff comes from local artists and other craftspeople across the country, many of whom you can find also on Etsy if you like their stuff. 

Once in a while I'll come in and buy something (spent a hundred freaking dollars on TWO baby items the other day, ACK!) but most of the time I come in here for inspiration on things I can make myself at home for a fraction of the price.
