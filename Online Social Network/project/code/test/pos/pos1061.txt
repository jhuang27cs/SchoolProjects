This is def. as good as it gets. I work right down the street so it's perfect! I'm addicted! Thanks to my co-worker/boss Christie, she invited me to come to one class with her and I'm totally hooked. 

The staff is super friendly and the owner is really really nice and knowledgable. Any answers you have she can and will answer with the ut-most inteligence.

Thank you Bar Method, Palo Alto. You have made a difference in my life!
