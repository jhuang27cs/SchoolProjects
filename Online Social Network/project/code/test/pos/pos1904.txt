I think I frequent this boba shop so often that almost all the employees recognize me now.. I always order the usual - on a cold day, I'd get a hot bubble milk tea with large tapioca, and on a hot day - bubble milk tea with large tapioca. 

Yeah, I know, I'm boring for always ordering the same menu items. But I think this might originate from my fear or trying anything new and always liking familiar things (but why would I like to try new restaurants then?) 

Their popcorn chicken is almost always delicious, and the boba is cheap and quick and it always hits the spot. The employees are MUCH NICER THAN SWEETHEART'S EMPLOYEES. I almost never have a problem with having drinks taste too diluted or sweet.

I love boba and Quickly's is my go-to place when I'm around the UC Campus!
