I've been here for the lunch buffet and at night for dinner and drinks.

The lunch buffet seems like a good value if you eat a lot and have a hard time finding good vegetarian food in the U-District. Otherwise, I'd say it's just okay.

The place has a mirror ceiling, old chairs, and mismatched, painted tables that makes for a cool ambiance.

The bar at night is also a good haven away from classless Earl's or the sorority/fraternity overload at Finn MacCool's.

I say try it out!
