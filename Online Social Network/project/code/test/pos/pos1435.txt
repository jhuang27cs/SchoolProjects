Liked:
- Flat screen TVs mounted on the walls (in every room)
- ~$200 per night for a one-bedroom suite (spacious enough to sleep 5-6 adults).

Disliked:
- My room (coaches') room was 1408!!! Yikes!!!
- Spirits (You can feel a presence here. Important people have stayed here before)

Note:
Came here to coach my athletes competing in the 2009 National Collegiate Taekwondo Championships (http://ncta-usa.com; UCLA Taekwondo won third place!). 

VERY romantic rooms. GREAT place for a getaway. Right across the street from a ice skating park. This hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to Brown University; the walk is brisk, some uphill, but you get to see all the historic-looking buildings.
