Come here if you want an absolutely breaktaking view of the entire East Bay.  If you're a student at cal, there is no reason why you shouldn't come here at least once.  If you are not a student, definitely make an effort to come once.  You won't be disappointed.  Minus one star because it does tend to get crowded, and the hours are not too great.
