Especially the music is usually wonderful.   They have a variety of types of music,  so look at the calendar before you go!   In addition to their regulars, they tend to pick up performers who are in New York from out of town and have a free night.  It's a small place, and it's easy to talk to the musicians during their break.  Food is good, not really expensive.
