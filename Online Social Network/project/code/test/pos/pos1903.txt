Nice little addition on the Northside of campus. The food is nothing too crazy, but it is definitely good. My boyfriend and I shared the breakfast wrap with eggs, ham, potatoes, and cheese and were decently content. For about 5 dollars (ham was an extra dollar) I think it is a good deal. I have also had the fruit and walnut salad which is delicious. The fruits and veggies are fresh and the combination of subtle pear and tart blue cheese worked well together in my opinion. They give you a good amount of food so you'll definitely leave content.

The place itself is clean and relatively quiet. It can get busy during the lunch hour on weekdays, but nothing to worry about in comparison to the line at Urbann Turbann. The mornings are quiet and seating has never been a problem for me.

The variety of choices on the menu and the good food at a decent price will have me back here on multiple occasions.
