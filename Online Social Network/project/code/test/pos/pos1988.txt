Sitting on the edge of MIT, this Flour Bakery & Cafe unit is a magical mix of sticky buns, coffee and raw IQ from patrons who sport geek chic t-shirts to give a Mensa member pause. 

The decor is green-friendly coffee house hip. As busy as they are on a Sunday they could use a few sidewalk tables on a warm August afternoon for sheer perfection, but, alas, that is probably the doing of Cambridge, not the bakery.  

Inside you will find a truly AMAZING bakery.  Everything from the pastries to the bread for the sandwiches is not just fresh, but subtle in its tastes, simple in execution, and stylish in presentation.   They serve not only breakfast items but sandwiches and really great fresh soups.  A trip here for breakfast, lunch, or brunch will be rewarded.

The service is call it out after you order, which could use a little better system.  The coffee is good, but they have not found a bean worthy of their other culinary arts.  They need to keep a bit more staff on the weekends to keep the tables clean and the trash and plate bins emptied. That gets a bit gross and tiresome after a while.

Flour has  a cook book. I highly recommend it if, you, like me, are in the hinterlands where the only "BAKERY" signs anymore are found at your local supermarket, and not much to talk about.

My only complaint is that there isn't enough room in the restaurant to bring my white board so I can work out the math on the t-shirts and get the joke.
