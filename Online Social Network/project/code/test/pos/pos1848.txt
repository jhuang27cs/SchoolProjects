this is the most clever places evar! $1.50 for 2 cookies and ice cream!? YES PLEASE. i've heard of this place through friends and they were all correct; great to experience at least once. a bit on the "too sweet" side but still so good on a sunny day. CASH ONLY is the only downside but i won't hold them against that. lots of cookie choices and ice creams too! will have to come back on my next LA trip
