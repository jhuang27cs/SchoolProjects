The Middle East and I have a deep and meaningful relationship. It is THE place to go for shows (in my opinion)--cheap, small but not crowded (so you feel like a part of the performance rather than just watching a band in some huge stadium), with a good variety of shows and bands.

I recommend the downstairs for the best show-going experience. The upstairs is much smaller (like 5-people-in-the-back-of-the-car small as opposed to connecting-with-the-band small... get it?) and for some reason the mood just isn't right when you're watching a band perform on the second floor of a restaurant rather than in the sweaty basement with a shady side entrance and even sketchier bathrooms. It's just not the same.

I've only been to one of the three (or is it two?) restaurants connected to the Middle East. Their food was nothing special and overpriced for what I was eating. The coffee (Turkish, Greek, Middle Eastern... whatever they call it!) is worth a try though, I grew up drinking coffee like, so i thoroughly enjoyed it (but be warned, it's an acquired taste).

My Top Five Moments at the Middle East: 

5) Watching my friend play for the Emergenza festival/tour last year. 
4) Going to the Yule Ball and hearing bands like Harry and the Potters. (and being the oldest one there other than the parents..ha ha oh well).
3) Watching The English Beat perform with a member from The Specials! and skanking (aka dancing to ska) with complete strangers
2) Drinking the coffee... soo good.
and finally
1) Hearing some wasted guy behind me scream out "Babies on a Rocket ship!!!" half the night. Somehow it had started with him yelling Mates of State (which is the name of the band playing) and progressed to Snakes on a Plane and finally to Babies on a Rocket ship. classic.
