Clean store, well-stocked. Only store for miles that carries my dog's Canidae food, but at the same price I've paid before moving to the area. Their hours are very convenient (open until 9pm on a Friday). Called there to get a recommendation for a dog walker and they went the extra mile to connect me to a local walker who has been amazing. Would recommend Mighty Healthy to anyone who is not only looking for supplies for their pup, but for people who want to connect to a community of people who love their pets.
(and it's in the same shopping center as Mama's and REI to boot!)
