I really like Central Kitchen.  Always have.  It's reliable.  Never disappoints.  

I've tried a lot of different things on their menu, and I know their steak is very good.  In my last visit, we did a bunch of apps - loved their steak tartar, fried oysters and deviled eggs.

I think what I love most about Central, in addition to the food, is the atmosphere.  Good people, cozy, unpretentious.
