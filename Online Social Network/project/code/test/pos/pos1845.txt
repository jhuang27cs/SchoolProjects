Bro, I was so faded off that Jager last night. Plus I smoked like two and a half blunts so I was hella crossfaded. 

I was walking home to my dorm at Hedrick Summit when I came across a bro. I told him, "Bro where you headed man?" He told me, "Bro, im going to puzzles, fuckn curly fries, sooo bomb." I was like, "Hell yea bro lets go to puzzles, fuckn ranch sauce, so bomb. Plus im hella faded on that jager." 

"Jager Bro, im hella faded too.. Plus I got 19 Premiere, so bomb. I can swipe whenever I want. Fuckin worth it man. "

So we went to puzzles, and I swiped 5 times cuz I have 19P and I can swipe whenever I want. Fuckn curly fries, mountain dew, barbeque chicken pizza, chili dog, and a grip of curly fries. Cuz each order comes with curly fries so thats like 6 orders of curly fries right there. Plus I asked for extra ranch sauce cuz its hella bomb with curly fries. And on top of that I was hella crossfaded off that jager and two and a half blunts. 

After that we went back to my room for some guitar hero. I passed knights of cydonia on expert despite being hella crossfaded. 

Puzzles bro. Puzzles. "Where it All Comes Together"


Edit: I went to puzzles again, and I got my mack on. There was this fine as trick but she didn't have any swipes left cuz its the end of the quarter and she only has 14P. I told her, "Don't worry baby, I got 19 Premiere, I'll swipe you in." So I swiped her in twice for ice cream and curly fries and we made out in her room later. (plus we were both faded on jager.)
