We recently bought a Kayak and Thule Rack and a few other related items at EMS. Choosing the kayak was a big decision and we had great expert help from a few of the people there. Matt and another person whose name I have unfortunately forgotten, were great in helping my wife and I to hone in on the right kayak and paddle.  When we came back to pick up the boat and put it on the car, Eric helped with how to properly load and strap on the boat. Apparently he has had a lot of training from Thule and his expertise was obvious. They couldn't have been more helpful or knowledgeable.  I will definitely do all my outdoor gear shopping with them.
