There are a few luxuries in my life that I am unable to sacrifice:  saturday afternoon siestas, Haagen Daaz vanilla bean ice cream, manis & pedis, AND...

Apple Butter!  OMFG.  Apple butter on cornbread with a side of chili.  Actually, hold the chili or the corn chowder, or [W]hatever nourishing food you order to avo[I]d [L]ooking [L]ike a butter-freak, and just [P]resent me with a h[U]ge effing pla[T]e of cornbread and a bowl of apple butter f[O]r me to d[U]nk my face in[T]o until I emerge, sated and resembling the title character in Mrs. Doubtfire.  

This is located on the 101, just north of San Luis Obispo.

Nothing to [D][O] this weeke[N]d?  [T]a-da! [D]rive h[E]re and get me some app[L]e butter!  You c[A]n have some for [Y]ourself, but if you return empty-handed there will be no groping for you on our "give the girl apple butter" date.  

You hear me?  No gropage if apple butter is not in hand.

Side note: (not intended to detract from urgency of butter request) their ho[M]emad[E] App[L]e Dumpl[I]ngs are to [K]ill for, th[E]re's a huge wait - [B]ut it's worth it, their gift shop is c[U]te, and [T]heir cookies are [T]rem[E]ndous. 

No wonde[R] I gained 40 pounds when I went away to college.  

BUTTER!!!!!

I think this review just clogged my arteries.
