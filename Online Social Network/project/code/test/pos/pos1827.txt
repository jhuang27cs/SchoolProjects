This is the real deal - a little Italy in itself.  Dimly lit, checkered tablecloths, comfortable booths and Chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling.  Romantic, a popular Valentine's Day destination.  One of our favorite places in Champaign.  I love the chicken capperi - the wine sauce is incredibly delicious.  Nice service.  Save room for dessert.
