I don't know why this place got only 3 stars. Anyways, I like Enzo's. Great place to go after a long night drinking or in my case, a long drive up from LA. I've been here on several occasions. First time I came in after farmers market on Thursday night at  1am. I later leaned they stop serving alcohol at 12am. WHAT?! Why not 2am like every other place in California?  I'm going to have to take one star off for that! It was surprisingly busy-full of drunk college kids getting some late night grub. It was very convenient since it was right there on Higuera  I ended up going with the disco fries and a pint of Stella Artois (my personal favorite) and proceeded to eat my fries outside at a table facing Higuera.  Since it was Thursday night downtown was crowded. It was nice to be able to sit back,eat fries covered in gravy for under $5 too! Pint of Stella was a little pricey but thats to be expected.  Fries were a bit rubbery,and very greasy but all in all not bad. Next time I came back I ordered the cheeseburger and a tall can of PBR. Good combination. Burger was alright nothing special. This place is good and I recommend it, only if you're really drunk though! It's open 24hrs which is also a plus.
