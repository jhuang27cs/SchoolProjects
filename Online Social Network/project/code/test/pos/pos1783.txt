If you have to see an endodontist, look no further,  you have found the best!  Dr Shoushtari saved my tooth. I have horrible teeth. I have 8 root canals in my mouth done by three different endos. This year I had to have a retreatment done on a root canal from four years ago.  It was the most painful thing I have ever been through. Dr S took me in the day my dentist called him.  He and his staff saw me at 5pm after hours and worked on my tooth until 7pm.  His office was in touch with me everyday during this horrible situation.   I won't bore you with the rest of my painful ordeal and I NEVER write reviews, but all I can say is if you need an endo, you have found him!
