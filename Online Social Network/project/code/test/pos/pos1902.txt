I am from the Chicagoland area and looking for an unabbridged Greek Dictionary for a friend. I called & emailed over 30 book stores.The only person that helped me find the book was Daniel at Schoenfof's Foreign Books. He was very personable and really took his time with me. So it's a Five star rating from me.
