Me: "Is that Dulce de Leche on that waffle?"
Cashier: "No, it's awesomeness."

Must-haves: Speculoos Special with Toffee Oreo Ice Cream [B+]

Obviously based on that conversation I have to say awesome service right off the bat. Guy was super cool, let me have a few samples and talked about food very passionately.

Went to an IE food truck fair and had no intention of trying waffles but I somehow found myself in line.

I ordered the speculoos special with ice cream on top based on off the guys' recommendation and it was superb! The waffles taste they are somehow filled with pure goodness...it really doesn't even taste like a waffle...it taste more like a donut! The speculoos taste like graham cracker peanut butter and it perfectly complemented the waffle. I suggest you order the crunchy version to add some more texture to your delicious treat.

I have to say that of all the food trucks at this event, this was by far the standout! Give this truck a try!
