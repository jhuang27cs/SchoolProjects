This was my very first time doing a barbecue a la Brazil, so I was stoked to be fully immersed in the experience of it all.  We got there a little bit late around 8:30 and the restaurant was packed.  The ambiance of the restaurant was good - the interior was simply done and very chic at the same time.  The crowd was lively and the wait staff appeared very well put together and courteous.  To top it, there was live music.

We were seated upstairs and the waiter came right away in his cheery and welcoming atittude - which I VERY much like in a restaurant.  We all got Rodizio (unlimited amount of bbqs and side dishes) and of course some capirihnas.  We helped ourselves to the salad/sides bar which had plenty of fresh vegetables, grilled vegetables, soups, cheese, cold cuts, small appetizers and fruits - awesome.  Then these dudes with big skewers of met came around to bless us with whatever cuts of meat that we wanted - there was lamb chops, tri tips, filet mignons, pork loin, brazilian sausae, turkey, leg of lamb, spicy chicken, and grilled pineapples.  All were delicious - not overly spiced, just simply prepared and well prepared.

I'd recommend this place for a get-together, it's a little too much food...but if you're a serious meat consumer, this is the place to be.
