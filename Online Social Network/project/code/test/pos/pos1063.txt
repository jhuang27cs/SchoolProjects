I visited this salon based on Yelp reviews. In Pasadena for work and my nails were all chipped, was in dire need of a manicure. 

I had Michelle and she was wonderful, both in doing my manicure as well as personality. Her staff was so sweet and amicable, and even helped choose a color for my nails! Merino Cool by Essie. They have a lot of OPI and Essie colors to choose from, which made me happy!

Michelle was so detailed in painting my nails and didn't miss a thing! I am very happy with her and if I come back to Pasadena, I'll be sure to come back!
