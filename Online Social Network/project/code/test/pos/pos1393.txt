This place is great.  I was invited to a sneak peak the other night and loved the Chicken Tikka Burroti!  I highly recommend to anyone in the Bay area.  Also, if you are around Palo Alto, it is going to be one of the only places in Town & Country that is open until 10pm.

I'm not someone who regularly eats indian food but this place is unique and I will definitely be back.
