Went on Saturday night this place is quite the scene we couldn't get a table. There was a long wait so we decided to wait it out even though it was already 9:30 and we hadn't eaten.  Seemed like no one was getting up they had live music dancers so it was an event not just like going to dinner. Finally a few people got up from the bar so we grabbed a few bar stools. I wanted to try a few things but when I went to order the chicken quesidilla the bartender told me it was a huge portion. So I  stuck with that for my meal only  $8. I wanted to try a taco they sell them individually for $3-$5 depending on if it veggie,chicken,shrimp, steak, or pork. I figured I didn't want to stuff my face so I only tried the quesadilla. The food was good for the scene. I wouldn't say it is authentic Mexican but good enough.Prices are very reasonable too.
