YAY!!!!! Haven't been yet to this location, but I'm celebrating the re-opening of Pizza Oggi. Kudos to stalking restaurants!!!! I was totally devastated when they closed the JP location, and mortified when the Broad Street location closed recently.

I'll stop by the Harvard Sq one tomorrow for lunch!
