On the last day of our training/workshop at Univ of Md-College Park, we got this great recommendation from a friend.  You definitely have to come here for the atmosphere which is hip and cool.  It has a brewery so got to try a beer as well.  Plus, it has a pretty cool general store to check out.  Arriving at Franklin's, I remember that there was parking kiosk but it wasn't working at the time.  So, free parking but get there early since it was pretty busy when we left.  I tried the fish which was good since it was light and not heavy on the sauce.  Overall, I would recommend this place since most everywhere we visited it was just either college hangouts or your regular TGIFridays near campus.  At least, Mama Lucia and this place were local restaurants that had character.
