I've been coming here for 4 years now and this year is the first time I've had their donuts.

I must say I'm surprised that the donut is still yummy after 24 hours from purchasing it.

I used to come here for the ham & cheese croissant and it was the best in town. I tried every donut place en route from home to work and this place was the best.

The cheese was always goozing out and the ham wasn't so salty.

They heated it to perfection and it filled my little piglet belly every morning.
