This place was impressive! I was surprised by the museum's size. They have various galleries that will keep you entertained a whole afternoon. I especially liked that the museum has a spectrum of arts such as sculptures, modern art, artifacts from different cultures, european antique paintings etc. The museum holds pieces by several famous artists. Best of all it's free!
