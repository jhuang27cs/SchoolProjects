Stumbled upon this no frills salon in my hood, and am so happy I did! She's able to book last minute waxes without issues, and at $25 for a Brazilian, it's a steal. No double dipping with the wax, super quick, and thorough. She's super nice and the simple atmosphere feels comfortable. No credit cards accepted though.
