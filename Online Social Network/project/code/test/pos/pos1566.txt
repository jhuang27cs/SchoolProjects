I stumbled across the reviews on here for Lark and set up a meeting with Christine over email. In person, she was easy to talk to and extremely clear about what was included in the package, and gave us several options for our album (which ended up coming out fantastic). She also wasn't pushy or a hard sell at all like other photographers we met. 

Additionally, she wasn't jaded at all towards us, and had the amazing drive and vigor we wanted in our amazing photographer to get those special moments caught on camera. All of the photos we got were edited for perfection. We honestly had the hardest time trying to narrow down the photos we wanted for our album because we loved them all! 

Her 2nd photographer was brilliant also. 

One thing I regret is not getting the video also through her, as with the level of quality and service we got for the price, we could have done better to capture our once in a lifetime moment! 

I highly recommend booking these photographers before their rates increase three times over. It won't be long for this kind of quality--I can assure you they will rise to the top (you pay for what you get!)

Thank you SO much!
