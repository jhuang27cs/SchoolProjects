I make frequent stops at this location weekly. I love how for lack of better words they are fresh and easy. The parking lot is easy to navigate and it is quite large, meaning no waiting or battling for a spot. Everything I have purchased from here has been a big hit with whom ever i was cooking for. I have brought multiple tri tips to family functions and have received plenty of undeserved praise on the marinade.

  The Friends card is the only way to go. Free money for spending money. Sounds great to me. I have racked up over $100 in free friends money in about a year or so. This has come in handy, It would more so if they had locations all over the US. I could then have my college freshman little sister go and use my points for her meals. Until then I guess I have to keep mailing out gift cards. 

  The coolest thing about fresh and easy is the new scan and pack as you go system. You scan and pack your own groceries, so when you are done shopping you replace the handset on the console, it uploads everything into the computer, you pay and you leave. Very simple. Very fast. 

   They even have Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf beverages you can purchase up front. love it...
