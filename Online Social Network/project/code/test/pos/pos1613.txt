I thought "reviewing" my school was a little silly, until I saw all the negative reviews listed (curiously, mostly from non-alums).  

So for the record, I went to Stanford as an undergrad and stayed for graduate school. I love Stanford, even as I cringe at the numbers on my tuition bill and wonder how much of it is going to what appears to be a quarterly replacement of the plants on the Oval (and that palm tree that just refuses to live in front of Gates).  I fell in love with the gorgeous sun-drenched campus the first time I set foot on it.  Yes, the place looks like a resort.  Yes, the students are preppy and a lot of them sure seem rich. Maybe it's not for you, but If I had a time machine, I'd happy go back and relive life as a Lag freshman all over again.  My Stanford experience was wonderful.

Now, if you happen to be on campus for an afternoon, here's what, in the opinion of one local alum, you should do:

* Drive down Palm Drive. See the palm trees and the classic view of the Oval and Quad against the foothills (and if you really liked it, buy the postcard in the Bookstore).  

* Walk around the Quad (I particularly like to do this at night).  Check out the Burghers of Calais and the fresco on the front of MemChu (yes, it sounds stupid, but everyone calls it MemChu).

* Go to the Rodin Sculpture Garden, outside of the art museum.  Buy a sandwich at the Cool Cafe and sip iced tea on the patio overlooking the garden.

* Walk around the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden in the patch of trees in front of Roble (also very cool at night, when the sculptures are lit up and, if you're lucky, taiko is playing).  

* If Lake Lag happens to be there (it's a seasonal lake, most likely to be around in January), stroll around the banks of the lake.  If you're feeling really adventurous, sometimes there's a raft you can take out onto the lake itself.  Try and spot some endangered tiger salamanders.

* Check out the cactus garden, the mausoleum, the angel of grief statue and the Stone River sculpture (all in the same area).
