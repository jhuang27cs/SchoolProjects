The lamb is delicious here.  The portions might seem small but then you just keep eating and eating the injera fills you up quickly.  Try a glass of honey wine.  The honey tastes very subtle but it's perfect.  Also, the kategna appetizer was delicious.  Basically it's toasted/fried injera with spices.  A bit greasy  but it will wake up your taste buds.  This places gets super crowded so try to call ahead for reservations.

My only complaint is that I wish their spicy dishes would be even spicier!
