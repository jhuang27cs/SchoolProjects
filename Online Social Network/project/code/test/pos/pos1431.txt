The best burger and beer joint in Atlanta bar none. I had the black and blue which was excellent featuring and entire ice cream scoop full of bleu cheese. The blackening season added an extra kick to the perfectly seared sensation. The fries were kicked up a notch by a cheese queso dip that was phenomenal. 

The Vortex features what has to be the largest bar selection in the city also featuring a great selection of beers on tap. The biker themed dark decor is also a winner. Open late and it is great. A must burger experience if your in Atlanta.
