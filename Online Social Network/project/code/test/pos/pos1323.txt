i love the veggie bánh mì at jujube that you can get at lunch. it's the perfect size and the homemade cucumber pickles on top just a little bit sweet but mostly not. the soy chicken is cooked perfect and i like having a *good* fake meant option for lunch. the sandwich is loaded with cilantro and jalapenos. the cabbage slaw that would usually go on top of the sandwich is on the side because it wouldn't be possible to get it in your mouth otherwise.

i also like to enjoy a cup of their oyster mushroom curry soup. the flavor is outstanding. it's pretty spicy but you can still taste all the flavors of the curry. i personally like to get my own sandwich and share a cup of soup with a lunch date there. 

and in case you don't know the best bánh mì in the triangle is at dalat in raleigh. see my other review. they have a fried or grilled tofu sub that is amazing!
