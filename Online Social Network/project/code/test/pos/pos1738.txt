The Land of Nod is a new children's furniture/toy/music store.  The furniture is nice but I usually go for the nice selection of "antique" toys (you know replicas of things that your parents probably played with) and great selection of children's music.  

The selection of children's music is great.  I go by everytime we go by to listen to something that is a bit more tolerable than the Wiggles.  They have a listening station in the front of the store so I can listen and watch for the young 'uns making a break for the door.

Well worth the visit!
