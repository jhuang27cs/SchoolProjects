I had the brie, basil, and sun dried tomato pesto sandwich.  Amazing!  Oh so good!  And hands down, the BEST Arnold Palmer I've ever had.  The guy muddled the lemons first and then made it the drink as per usual.  Will definitely go back.  Very reasonably priced as well.

How can you complain about a sandwich shop that serves booze?? Seriously though. I have been to Flowers on multiple occasions and each time i enjoy myself. Good food, Good atmosphere. Good prices. Good company every time. Thus far i have yet to try their buffet (what can i say? I just cant resist a good sandwich) though it always smells so very amazing. Maybe next time.
