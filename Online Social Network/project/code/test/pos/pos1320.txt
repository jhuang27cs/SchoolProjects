These guys get it! I have never experienced such a clean, well run practice. Everything seems to run flawlessly, and I love how they embrace new ways to communicate with their clients e.g., email, social media channel, e-blast newsletter and electronic health records . Enough about the operational elements, at the end of the day it's about your Doctor, right? I have been seeing Dr. Lee Kaplan for ~15 years off and on and he is  fantastic. He is so supremely knowledgable that it seems he can diagnose and treat your ailments in his sleep. When you look-up "seasoned professional" on Wikipedia, don't be surprised to a picture of Dr. Lee Kaplan.
