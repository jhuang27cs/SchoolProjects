When I stepped inside this market, I was amazed. On the right side are hundreds of different kinds of herbal, holistic, and natural pharmaceutical products to take care of your health. On the other side are fruits and vegetables, ALL ORGANIC, snacks, drinks, soups, and all sorts of other foodstuffs. The prices are amazing--69 cents a pound for organic red onion (locally grown)? That would cost 3 times as much at whole foods. Everything else is either ridiculously cheap by organic standards or very competitively priced. The store is clean and well-maintained with a family-run feel. The owner is a pharmacist as well. There is so much goodness crammed into this little store. They even had a nice selection of quality goat cheeses, which are generally better than cow's cheeses. It's conveniently located near the Claremont Transit Center and the newly built large parking structure.
