Reliably great place to get a haircut. I've been here several times and always been happy. Important to note that I've also never made an appointment, but have never had to wait more than about 2 minutes.

Call me cheap, but the ONLY reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I feel like a simple guys haircut should be a max of $20, instead of the $25 they charge. But of course, this has not kept me from returning several times. Locally owned, good people. Worth the extra few dollars!
