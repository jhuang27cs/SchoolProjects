I could've sworn I wrote a review for this.. perhaps I'm going crazy.

Okay, the usual goes for a sex shop goes here. There's a funky smell. Don't worry. You get used to it. Just take big breaths of air.

You can usually find a really good selection of DVDs, magazines, and toys. Even sex partners (check out the creepy voyeuristic bulletin board near the entrance.) A fun thing I like checking out besides the bulletin board are the snapshots of people who dared to steal stuff from the Toy Box. How pathetic do you have to be to be on the Hall of Fame?

For sex stores in the Inland Empire, this is as good as it gets. Anything better, I'd suggest going to WeHo.
