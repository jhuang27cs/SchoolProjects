It is true, as many other reviews state, that service can be slow.  And that depending on who happens to be in the store on any given day, there can be confusion about the state of progress (maybe there has been recent personnel hiring or turnover).  But these should be considered minor tests of patience in return for getting service that will be comprehensive, intelligent, and thoroughly explained with honesty even when it turns out that the customer is getting irritated and/or is ignorant on some important point.  If you have a problem, just ask for Tyler.
