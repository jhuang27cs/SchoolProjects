With 124 other reviews, there isn't much that remains to be said about Native Foods... but it's one of my favorite restaurants, and I was tipped off that the reviews weren't entirely favorable, so I thought I could help balance things out a bit.  

This place is entirely vegan, entirely delicious, and beloved by vegans, vegetarians, omnivores, and mostly-carnivores.  It's not "health food", per say, but it's damn tasty and high quality, and I wish they would put one in San Diego so I could eat there every week.
