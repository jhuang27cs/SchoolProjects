I have driven past this place for a year and a half always saying we should stop and check it out.  My mother recomended it so we gave it a try.  I have to say I can't wait to go back.  The buffalo burger is awesome, quite a tasty animal no wonder they killed 99.9% of them (j/k).  My dinner companion got a chicken sandwich and liked it very much.  Seating is a little odd on the inside may take a while to get service but its a great place.
