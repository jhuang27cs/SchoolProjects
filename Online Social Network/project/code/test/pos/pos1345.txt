I enjoyed the afternoon spent at the Silk Elephant. 
We wanted to try a new restaurant, which at first was hard to find a choice that was open before 5pm, even on a weekend.  
Based on another review, I ordered the mushroom soup, which did prove to be delicious. We ordered other yummy items such as the Silk roll, shrimp toast and phad thai, ect. 
The environment is elequant n soft and the lighting isn't blarring.  The staff was great, the bathrooms clean and the food was different, tasty and had a unique plating style. All over, completely decent!
