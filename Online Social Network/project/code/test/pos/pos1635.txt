Like the old-school ice cream trucks, this lady delivers cupcakes--and good ones at that!  Like others mentioned, the red velvet and salted caramel were the best.  I have had really good cupcakes, and these were right up there, just not the best I've had.  That said, you can't beat the excitement we all feel when she pulls into JLS (where i work) when everyone rushes to stand in line for her treats.  It's like being a kid all over again.
