Wooow! That's a little harsh Jeff. My experience was excellent overall, the broth doesn't taste like other pho cause there's no MSG!  Major benefit and health bonus there. Plus the price is for the Pho is really reasonable for a tight budget person like myself.  

Don't get me wrong, I ate my share of Pho, probably tried all the Pho restaurants in Settle, but its always loaded with MSG, whcih is short for "Massive Stroke Guaranteed". So I'm glad this place is a genuine "NO MSG" place, HORRAY!! 

Plus this the only place on the Ave that sells Thai food as well, a lethal combination of yumminess. 

Cheers
