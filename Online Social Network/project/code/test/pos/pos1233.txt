This place is tiny (and cute)! I came here for my birthday a couple of months ago and it was pretty good.

Some of the items are hit or miss. The burger with the fried egg on top was very good, but the flat bread pizza was not. They also do bruschetta very well, specifically the tomato one. It was fantastic. Some of the portions, like the salmon plate, was very small, but it is a tapas place, so what do you expect? I saw their happy hour specials and it seems like a great deal, so I will be returning some day soon. For a small place, their wine selection was decent.
