I have to respectfully disagree with Marc D. on this place. I work down the street, equidistant from Cosi and Cafe Main. I eat there about twice a week, when I have the inclination to go and get something outside or forget my packed lunch. Everything I've had there has been really good. Not exquisite, but it's a cafeteria, not a restaurant. The food is prepared in front of you, and their specials are inexpensive and plentiful. So far I've had a tenderloin sandwich (delicious), a steak-and-cheese from the grill (very edible, but it was a slab of beef, not the shaved steak I'm used to), a stir fry (also very good), and today, a turkey, stuffing, and mashed potato sandwich.

I have heard from some of my coworkers that the bread for sandwiches is a little dry and stale at the end of their serving day (around 2:00 I think), but since I'm generally there at 12-1, I haven't experienced this.

The fact that a fresh-made sandwich and a generous side is only $6.50 makes this place my pick for quick lunch. Their specials rotate daily, you can get the special as an entree or a sandwich, and they also have a daily "exhibition" meal which is also $6.50 that is some kind of stir fry prepared in front of you.

Not sure what Marc ordered that was pre-sliced with the wax paper indent, but everything I get is fresh sliced and made at the time of ordering. I'd say avoid the grill and go for the entree or exhibition (the first counter you see on entering from Main St).
