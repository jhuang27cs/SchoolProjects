A lot has been said about the beauty of the building and the hotel, so I want to talk specifically about the events staff.  There was some major staff turnover in the middle of our planning which shook things up a bit, but nothing bad came of it.

We had our wedding reception here, and I was so impressed with the level of service we got.  I used to work in banquets at a big hotel chain (we did a wedding every weekend all summer), so I know what it takes to put together an event like this, and the office and kitchen and serving staff did a phenomenal job.  Ellyn was especially wonderful!  I came down to her several times on the morning of the wedding with "just one more thing..." and she was totally on and very gracious.  Our guests all commented on how friendly the serving staff were, and my mother mentioned that towards the end of the evening she noticed the bartender dancing with himself while the rest of us rocked out on the dance floor.  It's great when people clearly enjoy doing their jobs!

The evening was truly lovely, and the service was above and beyond what I expected.  I would highly recommend the BCC for an event like this.  I almost wish I could do it all again!  Absolutely perfect.

We also reserved some rooms for our guests, and the hotel staff were fantastic and it all went off without a hitch, even when we were adding and rearranging things at the last minute.
