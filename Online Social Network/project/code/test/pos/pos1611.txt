Thai food is all about bold contrasts, fresh ingredients, and balance, and Thai market delivers on all of these. I went with a group and tried a little from other people's plates. I had the best Thai snapper I've ever had and a beautiful yellow curry. Plus, the appetizers were well sized, reasonably priced, and a little different than usual. The Pad Thai was good, but not epic (I have a great place right by my apartment for that). The drinks were fantastic.

All around, a great new place. I wish I was still at Columbia, because I'd head down here all the time!
