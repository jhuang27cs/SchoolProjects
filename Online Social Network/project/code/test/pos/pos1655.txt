This was by far the best service I ever got at the restaurant! I never knew why service matters so much as it's pretty much always the same, but not at Cafe Japengo! We were treated like royalty, staff was amazing and so helpful! The waiter even told us that he'll hold off on our last order to see if we still want it after we are done with main dishes.  Then we had a dessert on the house! This was a big tip well deserved!
Sushi was very fresh and delicious, presentation even better. We couldn't have found a better sushi place in San Diego! Can't wait to return!
