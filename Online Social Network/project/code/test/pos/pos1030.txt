Two words: Beer towers. Okay, so the food isn't exquisite. They can make a tasty Cuban sandwich, to the surprise of this Florida girl. I really like their beer, they're located conveniently close to the movie theater, and I really like their beer. Some quality stuff always available, plus interesting seasonal choices, and you can cart home a 1/2 gallon growler of your favorite.
