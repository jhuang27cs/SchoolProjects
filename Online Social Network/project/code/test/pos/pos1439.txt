I thought I reviewed this place some time back, but I guess not. Went again and it is so friendly, small and fresh! They cook the pita for you when you order, it only takes a few minutes and is so worth it! the lamb is so tender, the salad so creamy, and the flavors all come together for me. We really like it!
