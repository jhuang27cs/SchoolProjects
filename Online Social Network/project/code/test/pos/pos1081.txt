As good as it gets for Burgers in Claremont. This place serves the "Back Abbey" burger, which is what I'll review below. They also carry an extensive collection of European import brews on tap. Located in the newly developed area of the Claremont village, the Back Abbey is nestled in a small building with some out side seating. The decor is a  industrial feel to it, but also a mixture of small Euro brew house. 

I walked in and was directed to one of the open tables. Within a few minutes, an attentive server was getting us drinks and menus. I perused the fare for a bit, but ultimately settled on the Back Abbey burger (medium) and the half order of fries. The burger arrived in about 15 minutes, warm and fresh. The patty was very fresh tasting compared to some of the burgers I had eaten recently. The Brioche bun had an aoili of some sort on it and some greens. There was a slice of smoked bacon on there was well. The fries were done in duck fat, perfectly crisped and oozing with flavor. All in all, the meal was fabulous, though a little on the pricey side (13 dollars for the burger).

Everything added up here. I really enjoyed the meal and the beer selection. It's definitely a place to make a return trip.
