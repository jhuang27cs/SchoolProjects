I would say that Border Cafe is the best Mexican Food in Cambridge.  And it's a pretty chill place to take a large group.  

Strong drinks are highly appreciated - staff is not stingy with the tequila when it comes to their margaritas.  And the chips and salsas are top tier.  

Let's face it, Mexican food is Mexican food.  The booze at Border is the differentiating factor here and that's enough in my book.
