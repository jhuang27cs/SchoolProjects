I have been here at least once a year when visiting my friends in Easthampton and it is one of the things that has become a tradition while up in Western Mass.  Go get maple.  My co-workers ask me to bring back some maple products and this is my go-to spot.   Despite it being absolutely beautiful in the fall, they have so many different maple things.
The traditional syrup, cotton candy, donuts etc... This time around we tried maple soft serve, and maple bacon ice cream. Holy cow! amazing!!!!!

The only thing that disappointed me was that the petting farm was under construction. We got to see our goat friends but that was it.  The mums and produce made up for the lack of animals.  

I can't stress how much I love coming here.  The drive along the river is breathtaking. It was the perfect trip. I cant wait to come back next spring for the sugar shack breakfast!
