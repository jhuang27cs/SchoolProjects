Just had a good experience with New Harlem Car Service. Called them for a trip from Morningside Heights to the West 70s. Car showed up within minutes. The driver was courteous and he helped me with my unusually large amount of luggage. The car was clean, odor-free and I got where I was going without any incident. I would recommend their service to anyone.
