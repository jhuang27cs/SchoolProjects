Veggie Galaxy is awesome! Definitely rivals (if not beats) the infamous Chicago Diner. Delicious veggie burgers, I had the mushroom chickpea Inman Square over arugula, and fabulous fries! They have a dedicated gluten free fryer for them. Yay! This was the first time in over two years I was able to have fries. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It gets pretty crowded here on the weekends, so arrive early or be prepared to wait for a little while. I just wish they would offer a gluten and corn free dessert (their pudding has cornstarch in it).
