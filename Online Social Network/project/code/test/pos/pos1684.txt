I really like this place, it's such a great change to all the dive bars this far up on the UWS. There really (and sadly) is nothing else like this. Great lounge atmosphere and full food menu. Good wine and beer selection. Beers on tap aren't any you are likely to know, so just let them know the general kind of beer you like and they'll serve that to you! 

I haven't gone here yet for food, just for drinks out at night. It gets really crowded, which is the downsize, the super small size of this place. Don't have your party here, there's no room! I originally went here thinking it was a wine bar, it's not, but you will find wine and seating and you can hear each other to talk even though there's a DJ. 

They have great brunch deals, i'll have to come back for brunch or check it out when it's more coffee shop during the day.
