After all my world traveling it is always a pleasure to visit home and catch a movie at the Palm. I literally will show up and pick the first random title that catches my eye, buy a bag of freshly popped and affordable popcorn, nestle into the seats of the intimate theater reveling at the fact the whole establishment is powered by solar and enjoy the show. This theater shows thought provoking films found no where else in SLO County and brings more than just a film to your enjoyment of the evening.

As far as I am concerned, this is the best theater in the world.
