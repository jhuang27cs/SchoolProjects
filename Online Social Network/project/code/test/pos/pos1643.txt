i've never been here, and I'm told it's very low frills (my husband learned the hard way: always come with clean dry hair)-- but man do they give my husband excellent haircuts.  I can't remember his stylist's exact name, but I know it's french (Jacques? Jean-Claude?) and I know he's a genius.  I've known my husband for 5+ years and he's had dozens of bad haircuts, first in NYC then in LA that cost everywhere from $10-$150.  In fact, I used to not let him get his hair cut w/in a week of important events, but the guy he goes to now always gives him flattering cuts that look good the day of the cut and grow out gracefully afterwards.  I even sent my husband for a haircut the day before we flew to Europe.
