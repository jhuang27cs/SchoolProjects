We went back a second time.  Same server - Ben.  I see a lot of reviews displeased with the service...but Ben is stellar.  Friendly, attentive...he even tried to get them to change the TV station so my husband could watch the pirates game from the particular TV that was facing our table.  

In terms of my last review - I took those chips/salsa home and continued to eat them all weekend.  Still good even a few days later. 

This time I got the taco salad and it was very good.  I've always been a fan of the fried tortilla bowl and this did not disappoint.  The chipotle ranch is a bit funky...smoky maybe?  Next time I'd go with regular ranch, but overall, I very much enjoyed my taco salad.  Really...it didn't even NEED dressing.  Despite all the less than stellar reviews, I still like this place.
