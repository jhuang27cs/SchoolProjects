Ah, the Rose Garden! An immense pleasure to me for at least the past 60 years. I used to live on 22nd Street near Vermont, near enough to take my bike down to Exposition Park on weekends, with my brown bag lunch safe in the spring-loaded clips of my bike rack.

It was a different time and place then: Expo Park wasn't the "in" place it is today. The museum, the garden, the science expo -- were almost secrets! I would chain up my bike in the bike racks and make a tour of all those places, having the whole place almost to myself. And of course the best time to visit the Rose Garden was when it was in bloom. Nothing is uglier than a square block of cut-back rose bushes.

And the fragrances were amazing. (The statue of the nude girl in the gazebo wasn't bad either...) If you've never been, you owe yourself a trip at least once! There's plenty of pay parking. And while you're there, hit the Museum of Science and Industry, the Space Museum, the Museum of  Natural history as well as the Rose Garden. I guarantee you a lovely day.
