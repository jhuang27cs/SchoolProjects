The decor is, as has been remarked, incredible, with hand-carved and -painted tables and chairs.  Service was excellent, although it was late on a Sunday and therefore not a good test of what service would be like when the restaurant is full.  My one complaint is that they could have used a little more of the Chinese restaurant water-glass ethic of constant refills.  The food was hardly spicy at all--if you like hot food, you should let them know and I assume they will make it hotter--but was incredibly flavorful and well-seasoned.  This is not your typical American Mexican place, and if that is what you are looking for you will be sorely disappointed.  It is, however, an upscale restaurant to compete with the best of Philadelphia, only at half the price or less.
