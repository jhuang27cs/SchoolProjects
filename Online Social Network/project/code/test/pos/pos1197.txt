chicken is delicious and portions are absolutely generous- i don't think this is the best peruvian chicken i've had, but its up there. something as mediocre as steamed rice is also exceptionally delicious for whatever reason. I've been here twice and I definitely suggest you come right when they're pulling the chicken off the spits because it makes a world of difference. The only qualm I have is that the yucca fries are eeeeehhhhhh because when they're cold they're like cardboard. I can't wait to try their other dishes!
