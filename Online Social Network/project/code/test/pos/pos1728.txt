I've been here several times and never had a bad experience. The food is good and the value is excellent - their noodle dishes are so big that I usually have to take home half.  My favorites are any of the curry noodles; I also like their lychee soda and thai iced tea.  Two warnings: they don't serve alcohol, and it's cash only (there's an atm in the restaurant).
