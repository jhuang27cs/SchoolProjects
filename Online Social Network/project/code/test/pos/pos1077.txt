Solid, fresh, made-to-order (probably the best) burgers on the Ave... Tasty and it doesn't feel like a gut bomb afterward. They've got a good choice of fixings/toppings and their fries/curly fries come in a heaping pile.  The price can get a bit steep if you bling up your burger but whatever, it's tasty.
