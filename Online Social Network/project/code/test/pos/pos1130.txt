Several of my friends have instructions that, should I ever be involved in a freak accident involving a bus, they are to bring me Cocomero, specifically 1/2 cheesecake, 1/4 peanut butter, 1/4 banana with yogurt chips and 4 pieces of banana. I like Cocomero OK. It's a cool concept. Apparently, the same sort of stuff is popular out west. If I had more money and was paid more often, I'd definitely go more often.
