a must try if your in atlanta!!  I always have to stop by here when i am vistiting grandparents. This place is amazing!!  It does get busy but the food is worth the wait. The chili dogs here almost matched up with pinks hot dogs. The onion rings here are the best!!  Frosted orange is delightful. try it.  Only bad thing is its really greasy and probably not good for you. But good enoug to have one time while your in atlanta
