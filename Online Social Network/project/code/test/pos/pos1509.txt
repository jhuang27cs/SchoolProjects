What I like about Yogurtland is that it's self serve, so you can get as much or as little yogurt and toppings as you want.  They also have seasonal yogurt flavors that are very good and you can sample all of the yogurts beforehand if you can't decide on a flavor.  It's within walking distance of USC campus so you don't have to worry about meter parking or Gateway garage parking.
