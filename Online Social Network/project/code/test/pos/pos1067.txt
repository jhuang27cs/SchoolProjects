This place was recommended by the Cambridge fire department as a must go to place. They were absolutely right. This place had the best homemade creamy ice cream that I ever had.  I had the Belgian chocolate and the butter chip. Shear decadence. They are very generous in their serving size too. Their small is equal to a medium or large at most places. Go you wont be disappointed.
