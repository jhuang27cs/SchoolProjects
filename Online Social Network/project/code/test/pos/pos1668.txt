Exceptional team atmosphere at Buona Tavola - from the front of house, bussers, servers working together seamlessly... just a fantastic experience, which is a big part of dining in my opinion.

Nice and reasonably priced wine selection. Enjoyed the Treana white Rhone blend and a couple different ports with a great special chocolate souffle type of dessert. Bruschetta with goat cheese was very good with beautifully ripe and delicious tomato!

Split a caesar with fresh shaved cheese and we both enjoyed our pastas. Something must be said for an arrabiata that doesn't have to overwhelm with heat in order to be tasty - was seasoned perfectly with just enough heat.

Drove from Morro Bay to get some quality Italian before a triathlon we had the next morning - well worth it. Will be back next year. Same time, same place. Thanks BT!!!
