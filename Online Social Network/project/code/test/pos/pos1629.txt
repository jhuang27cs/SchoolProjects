We went to Legume on Saturday for dinner. The restaurant is small but friendly atmosphere. 
We had the pre-fix four course dinner. The menu changes periodically, but the flavor remains consistent and wonderful.  For appetizers, we had turnip soup and sate mushrooms.  Entrees we picked duck and salmon.  Lastly, panna cotta for desert. 
Everything was delicious. The service was excellent.  We definitely return to try out new menus and recommend this place anytime.
