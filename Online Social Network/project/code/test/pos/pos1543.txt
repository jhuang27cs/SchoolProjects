Don't let the trashy exterior and limiting titular signage fool you - there's more to this place than an experience at one of the many one-trick pony "roasted pollo" places in the DC metro area would lead you to expect.

I had the seafood enchillada which was superb and put the one I had at Chevy's during a team lunch to shame. Large portions, quick service, plenty of lobster and shrimp inside - compared to Chevy's bland and stingy seafood enchilada.

Great homemade-tasting salsa and tortilla chips, my coworkers' all enjoyed their meals thoroughly (to the point of rave review) here as well.
