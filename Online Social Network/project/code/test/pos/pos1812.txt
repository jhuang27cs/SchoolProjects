Whenever I go to SLO for work we have dinner on the first evening at Novos.  The patio is perfect for unwinding...it is intimate, not too loud, heaters make sure you dont
get too cold, and there is even a little creek...

the food ranges from mushroom raviolis to curry dishes...so get a few friends, order a bunch of plates and split them all.  The shrimp plate is great too.  Obviously, I must mention the cheese plate because I am not obsessed with cheese plates.  The wine list isn't extensive but you will find something you like...and if you don't drink the tea list is pretty amazing.   Even though there are THREE money signs on yelp, I didn't really feel that it was too expensive.  If you are in SLO, have a few friends or a date...check out NOVO.
