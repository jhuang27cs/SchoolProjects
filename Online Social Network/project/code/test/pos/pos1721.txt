Sureshot has everything I could possibly want in a coffee shop - decent coffee, good music, comfy chairs... pinball machines and table tetris?

Sureshot is notable for its white coffee, which is a different way of roasting coffee beans.  I think that the flavor is too malty, but I've generally been happy with their other coffee drinks.  The baristas are good at helping customers decide, there are big tables for you to spread out if you're studying or meeting and there are a few computers available if you need to check out your email, because it's been 10 minutes, omg.  In addition, there's a honor bookshelf that has a collection of awful romance novels that is starkly out of place in the dark coffee shop.

Most importantly, though, there's a table Tetris machine, where you can play head on head with your closest enemy/friend/significant other.  I think they play the music in the shop loud enough to try and overtake the Tetris music.

My only problem with Sureshot is I've found a lot of their pastries to be god-awful.  They do have vegan pastries and donuts, though, if you're into that sort of thing.

Bathroom: 3.5 stars.  You have to get a key for this joint near the condiment bar and there's only one for both men and women.  It's (usually) stocked, and the owners are trying to combat the emo graffiti by painting the walls black and adding some chalkboards for all things written.
