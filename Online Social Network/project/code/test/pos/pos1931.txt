I've been living at Club California for about a year now, and have had an overall positive experience. The condos are all privately owned and the tenants are almost entirely UCLA undergrad/grad students. 

Pros: There's a night time security guard 4 nights a week, so I feel a lot safer than I have in the 2 other apartment complexes I've lived in in Westwood. 

Gym is very nice. It has TVs, treadmills, ellipticals, free weights, a half basketball court, and is never too crowded during the day. 

Stainless steel appliances and granite countertops

Location is right next to westwood village--very easy walking distance to restaurants. 

Cleanest apartment building I've seen in Westwood. 


Cons: Walls are very thin--I live near the gym, and I can hear the TV's in the gym and the sound of people running on the treadmills. I am woken up frequently by construction by the pool or the cleaning ladies. 

No washer/dryer in the units. 

People always park in my parking spot. I guess that's not management's fault, but when I complained about it, the manager said there was nothing he could do.
