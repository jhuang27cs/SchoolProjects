This place is 100 times better than Blockbuster, and here's why.
1) It doesn't have that weird Blockbuster smell. You know what I'm talking about. I Luv smells like a library...kind of. Mmmm my favorite smell.
2) They have a way better selection of movies than Blockbuster. Where else would you go to rent such classics as Eraserhead, Un Chien Andalou, and Monsturd? Yeah, that's right, MONSTURD. Check that shit out. 
3) They have 2 for 1 Tuesdays and Wed. What does Blockbuster have? NOT THAT.
4) They have free beer on Tuesdays (?) haha no way Blockbuster can beat that.
5) Their prices are a lot better than Blockbuster. 
6) They have adult videos (aka porn) and stoner movies. Haha I definitely don't think Blockbuster has that.

Anyway, I could go on, or you could just get your ass over there right now and rent Monsturd. Really...it is HILARIOUS.
