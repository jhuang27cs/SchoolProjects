I've tried every sushi place in and near Ann Arbor, and In terms of best bang-for-the-buck, Sadako takes it away. 

I always go for the eel-with-avocado and salmon rolls. The eel bbq sauce is outstanding and the avocados are always soft and tasty. The salmon is fresh and served in large portions. 

And, worth mentioning, the prices are very reasonable.
