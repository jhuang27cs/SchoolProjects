The service and the staff were great, and, surprisingly, so was my spicy chicken sandwich, which was reasonably priced and came with a side salad. I also tried the pasta, but it was too garlicky for my taste.

This is a nice place for patio dining on a cool summer's eve, and the atmosphere is cool enough not to be trendy. I would definitely come back.
