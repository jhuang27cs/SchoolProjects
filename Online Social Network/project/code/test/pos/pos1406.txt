Only had the tacos and the fries here so far when visiting my girlfriend in SLO, but the fries alone are enough to give this a 4 star. The tacos were pretty good too, and the steak sandwich looks amazing. I'll definitely be getting that the next time I visit. 

P.S. The basket of fries is a MOUNTAIN of fries.
