My review of U Burger, in the form of a haiku tanka chain

order the "Yuppie"
burgers come with rings or fries
my mouth, watering

Why such the long line?
fuck, I forgot the Sox game
this isn't Starbucks
just order and step aside
and don't forget your number

it's not In-N-Out
and it ain't Five Guys either
but the burgers - yum!

Bathroom down the hall
way, way, way, way down the hall
and then make right turn
When you get back your number
will be called by then, enjoy

Second location
now open on Commonwealth
though not quite as good
