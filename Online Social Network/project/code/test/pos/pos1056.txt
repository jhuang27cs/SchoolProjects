Good sandwiches on good bread. I had the rosemary garlic chicken with added avocado -- it was huge! Definitely split with two people. Comes with a side of pasta, potato, or regular salad.

It also helps that they had free donut samples. The sign said "Free samples, take one" but I felt like taking three and you know how the customer is always right.
