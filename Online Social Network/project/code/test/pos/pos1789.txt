Your cup of coffee will be brewed exactly as it was meant to taste.  Here, there are always tons of choices in single cup brew coffee.  Don't know where to start?  Just talk to the staff, they know everything there is to know about coffee.  

Some of the baristas there do the roasting as well, since "The Commonplace" is a micro roastery based in the quaint old college town of Indiana, PA (sorry, I love old towns).  These guys take the time to create a "profile" for the green coffee bean so that the roast displays the best the bean has to offer, taking into account the region and growing circumstances, etc.  They're serious about coffee!

If you're looking for that special cup, this is the place to go (or if you just want an 8oz for a buck they've got that too, which is rare nowadays).  I can honestly say that the coffee was in great hands before it reached yours and the people in charge have done their best to make certain that its lived up to its fullest potential.  Now that's a real love of coffee- and you!  Sweet, huh?

P.S.  If you're a coffee geek keeping tabs on Pittsburgh's flourishing coffee culture, you might want to check out the article in June 2011's Fresh Cup mag, where Commonplace, 21st St, Espresso A Mano, etc... all given proper laud. ;-)
