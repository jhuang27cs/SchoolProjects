Okay, this place just reeks with hipster/scenester flavors but I love it nonetheless.  First off, it's next door to one of the nicest galleries in the area, Sandler Hudson.  Secondly, their Americano is just so yummy, especially when paired with one of their blueberry muffins.  Their sandwiches are decent, too.  

Another great thing about the place is that they usually display lots of art by aspiring local artists.
