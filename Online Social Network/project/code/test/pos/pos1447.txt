Fantastic!!  I had the shrimp and noodles husband had Angry Seafood. The
Spicy  black bean sauce tasted authentic chinese. we started with calamari and dumplings. The calamari was cooked perfectly dumplings were delicious. Our server was very attentive staff were pleasant. We had the sublime goat cheese-apple dumplings for dessert. This is our new special occasion place. It's worth every penny

Thank you  Jujube!
