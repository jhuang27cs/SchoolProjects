I love going into this place. It's cute, it's kitschy, and it's almost always empty or near-empty. The owner is friendly -- a big sports fan, a big classic rock fan, and totally knowledgeable about his products. I asked him what he used in his vegetarian chili dog (which, by the way, is filling, flavorful and adored by all the vegetarians I've known who've experienced it). If you hate Smart Dogs brand, you might not like it, but the delicious veggie chili (not too chunky, not so watery it soaks through the bun), mustard and onions mask most of the non-meatiness of the dog. The fries are thick, never mealy. Meat-eaters who aren't hot dog fans still like the kosher beef dogs, and the mountain of choices for toppings doesn't hurt! The staff is quick and everything's made to order, and I'm sure they'd be happy to turn down the sports on the TV if asked.
