I dig Neal's Deli the most. Congratulations to Matt and his awesome wife for opening this place up. The pastrami sandwich is the best in the state. Nothing like it outside of New York (that I've seen).  The muffaletta is incredible. And the hot dogs are served on PRETZEL BREAD. It can be kind of expensive depending on what you order, but you can get a cup of water. You don't really need that cream soda every time ;) Parking can be difficult to navigate, but you can find a place. It's carrboro.
