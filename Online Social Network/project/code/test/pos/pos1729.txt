Whitney's is a great litle dive bar right in the middle of Harvard Square.  That's reason enought to stop in.  People who have been working and living in Harvard Sq. for years get a puzzled look on their face when you mention it.  "Whitney's?  Where's that?"  It's such a non-descript dive that people walk right by without even noticing the place.  Cheap beer and a good rock jukebox.  Great place to water yourself when the other hipster bars are all crowded.
