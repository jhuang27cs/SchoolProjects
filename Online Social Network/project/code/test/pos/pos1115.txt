Cheap dinner!  I've recently become a fan of Linnaea's dinner specials, particularly rice & beans on Wednesday and chili with cornbread on Friday.  Both are vegetarian (the rice & beans probably are vegan too).  Many, many toppings are offered for the rice & beans.  The chili is available in a half-order size which, combined with the huge hunk of moist cornbread, is enough for a meal.  Oh, and don't miss the amazing selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Plus free Wi-Fi and live music!! (just beware of the very small, very faded sign regarding a $5 minimum for credit card purchases)
