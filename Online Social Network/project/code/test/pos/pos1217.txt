I came here for the first time today, and had a great shampoo and cut from Keana.  She was fantastic, and she kindly guided my posture the entire time, even when I was asleep most of the time, just like when I get a massage.   My cut was perfect afterwards, and my hair greatly appreciated the new change.

This place is very busy, with all stations full with clients, even in mid-afternoon.

The bowl of chocolates at the front desk was also helpful, as mentioned by another Yelper, especially since I arrived on a very light side.

Very convenient place, right in front of the parking garage.  However, garage was getting quite full already with holiday shopping season already started.
