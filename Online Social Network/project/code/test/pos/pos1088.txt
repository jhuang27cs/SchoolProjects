I love Trader Joes! Truly unique products at a great price! I usually end up buying way more than I need because everything looks so great. They have an excellent array of vegetarian/vegan fare, and I find something new every time I go. The only down side is that they aren't very consistent with the availability of their products. Something you'd find one trip might not be there the next... but they more than make it up with the variety of what they have to offer. Highly recommend this!
