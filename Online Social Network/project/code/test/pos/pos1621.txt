I was going to grad school in Berkeley in 97 so most of my review is old memories but I have eaten there recently when in town to see Dream Theater.

La Cascada is the best non-traditional Mexican I have had in Berkeley.  What used to be El Fabuloso on Telegraph was the best traditional style, and La Cascada was the best non-traditional.  What do I mean by non-traditional?  Well they have pesto chicken and Thai burritos.  In the era of World Wraps this really doesn't seem like much but 10 years ago when they opened they were serving them and they're still as tasty now as they were then.

I literally ate there every day for months, and the food is the same today as it was then.  My favorites are the seafood burritos (try them as a Torpedo Wrap if you're really hungry) and the pesto chicken burrito.  Nowadays I am a big fan of carnitas and their carnitas has never been very special, they're kind of dry.  Instead go for the pesto chicken burrito which has a very basil-y pesto.  

Beware of cilanto if you don't like it, they use a decent amount and it will ruin your dish.

To this day, any time I pass Berkeley I think of pulling off of 80 and popping in to grab a burrito.
