On this visit, I chose some other menu items to try with the goat cheese appetizer- Great braised greens, prosciutto & mozzarella pizza, as well as really good semolina dumpling pasta (in brown butter with winter squash and sage)...highly recommended!  Attentive service, as always.  Not much more to say than that

Also phenomenal:  squid appetizer, champagne truffles, olive oil/chocolate/sea salt ice cream.  Service is especially great- our server was so enthusiastic about recommendations of everything from the wine, to cheese, to every single dish we ordered.  Glutton-free menu available if you ask for it!
