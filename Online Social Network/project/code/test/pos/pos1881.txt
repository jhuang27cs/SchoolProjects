I owe this place props for their tennis selection. 

Any place that carries an actual SELECTION of tennis gear earns three stars right off the bat, no holds barred. And, any place that has DISCOUNTED tennis gear on their CLEARANCE RACK gets another star. B-I-N-G-O. 

Thank you, City Sports, for being one of the few stores in RI to offer tennis skirts, shorts, sneakers, balls, string, and, WAIT FOR IT, vibration dampeners. For a girl who is damn sick of ordering gear online, this is a breath of fresh air. I've also had my racket restrung (5 stars) and regripped (um, 1 star, but that's another story) here. 

Some of the reviews have complained about the service, but I have no problems to list. Service has been friendly but not overbearing. Prices are high, but you're buying top brands and CS has got to make a buck. Come here for the quality stuff that you can't nab at the huge box stores in Attleboro, Seekonk, and Warwick.
