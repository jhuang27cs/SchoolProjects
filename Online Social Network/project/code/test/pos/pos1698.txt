YAAAAYYY!! I'd leave the review at that, but I should probably get into more detail. I've been whining about the lack of these types of markets in the upstate New York area. Finally, the day has come! 

I should mention that I'm a fairly average shopper. I frequent Hannaford, Price Chopper, BJ's, and once in a blue moon Walmart. My goal, like most people, is to find healthy food at a reasonable price. I also don't want to have to spend a lot of time doing so, which is why I enjoy Hannaford's organic section so much. The Fresh Market is Hannaford's organic section blown out and all grown up. It is a time saver for me, and a very pleasant experience. 

I stopped in just before closing, so I can't comment on the parking situation. Seemed fine to me! Of course it was packed on opening day, what else would you expect? If you're really concerned about being 2 feet from the door, don't come on Saturdays or Sundays. 

I love the layout of the store. The TFM website describes it as "the atmosphere of an old world European market," and I would agree. I was most impressed by their produce selection. Okay, so maybe we're not talking BJ's prices on peaches, but the fact that I didn't have to spend 5 minutes digging through to find one edible looking fruit was very valuable to me. 

I found it interesting that they offer a few common brands along side their natural/organic offerings. For example, there was all natural mayonnaise alongside Hellmann's. I think they're either doing that to test out what we prefer as a whole, or because they want to give their customers a comfortable amount of variety. 

I had to run past the bakery as quick as I could, because everything looked too delicious. 

I agree with another reviewer: they should really expand their selection of household items. I'm sure with time they will. 

This place will definitely be a permanent part of my grocery shopping mix.
