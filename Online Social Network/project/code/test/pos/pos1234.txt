I'm giving this place such a good review because of the price and an awesome employee my group and I encountered on Tuesday.   We went in to watch The Avengers late night so parking was no problem (right in front of the theater).  Walked in and were encountered with your regular $3 theater. But once we got up to purchase our tickets my impression of the place changed.  Shandra at the front was amazing!  If you look like you're having a blast while you're at work then I am even more excited to come back.  The house was a bit strangely set up but it's okay.  Still had a good experience overall.  And yes we will be back on Tuesdays when that awesome person is there.
