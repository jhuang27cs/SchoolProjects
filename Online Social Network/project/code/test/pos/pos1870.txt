Kendle really is as good as it gets.  I have both worked with her on and hired her for events and she never fails to impress.  Not only is she a lovely women, but she is a true professional.  Nothing gets to her - she keeps her cool no matter what happens.  She goes out of her way to make sure that every detail is in place at events and that you never have to lift a finger.  

She also has a very stylish eye and finds vendors and locations that are unique, fun and a little out of the box.  Dont get me wrong, she can do traditional also, but I think her strengths lie in the unexpected.  

I most recently hired her for an event at the Annenburg Beach House.  We did the event in the gym and I was floored when I walked into the room.  She completely transformed the room into a chic boutique with a sporty edge.  

Honestly, Kendle is one of the best event producers you will find in Los Angeles - she has integrity, style and class!
