This place isn't somewhere you go for great Korean food by any means. It's trashy, it's cheap, it's filling, and it's consistent.

And I love it. I go here every time I'm in the area. It was one of my comfort foods when I went to Cal and it makes me happy every time I can get my hands on it.

The portions are monstrous. You get a giant pile of meat on a giant pile of rice with two small piles of kim chee and bean sprouts. Okay, the kim chee and bean sprouts aren't great, but I've had worse.

I always get the BBQ pork. The flavor is actually really fantastic. The pork isn't always super tender and can have some connective tissue or chunks of fat at times. But it's not hard to pick it out.

If you go to Cal then you already know about the Asian ghetto and have probably at least seen this place in the back. If it's late and you're really hungry then you can't do much better than Steve's. I know I'll come here every time I'm back for a bit of super filling and tasty nostalgia.
