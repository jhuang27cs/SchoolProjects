I went here with a group of five other people and had a wonderful dinner.  We made reservations and our table was ready when we arrived.  The restaurant itself is quite small and a bit noisy, so I'd recommend going on a date or with a smaller group. It took a very long time for our server to come around and get drink orders (we were still waiting on two people to arrive, so perhaps that was the reason for the delay) but everything was timed well after that.  The drinks were all very good and quite original.  Try anything with gin in it and you won't be disappointed!  I had the chilled peach soup to start with and was really impressed.  The presentation was amazing, as was the case for all of the dishes our group tried.  My entree was the braised pork cheeks, which were served over house-made pasta with asparagus.  The pork cheeks were absolutely delicious and the pasta was just about perfect, but I thought they were a bit stingy with the asparagus.  My husband started with the duck tongue carnitas and thought they were fabulous.  I only got a couple of tiny bites and was quite impressed.  The tri-tip my husband had as an entree was tasty and perfectly cooked.  I didn't love the desserts we tried and wasn't able to get much feedback on what the other people in our group thought of them.  The portion sizes here are great (not the gut busting, obesity-inducing heaps of food Americans have been taught to expect), however, the prices were a bit high for what we got.  I'd love to see the portions stay the same and the prices go down just a bit.
