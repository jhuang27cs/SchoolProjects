I have a threesome once a week.  It's not a spur of the moment trio, but more of a well thought out and planned one.  And it's always fun. 

Coleen L, Amanda M, and I have our ménage à trois, take lots of photos, and always take turns.  No one is the star of the show, and we all make sure everyone gets what they need and want.

We will always have our threeway in different places. Recently, it was at the newly remodeled Kerbey.  The waiter was nice, the queso good, entrees okay, but the remodel job kinda made us sad.

And no one wants to be sad during a threesome.

The colors, sights and sounds of the new Kerbey was all around strange. I can't quite put my finger on it, but maybe a cross between an old diner and mental hospital.  I had a vegan Migas taco, and I appreciate that Kerbey makes it easy for vegans and meat eaters to eat together.  But sometimes, that's just not enough.  Really, food is okay here, and the vegan queso is nice and (non)cheesy.  

I am sure our triad will return soon, but we gave it a try, and thats what counts.  And the threesome?  I was just talking about lunch with two friends.  Get your mind out of the gutter.
