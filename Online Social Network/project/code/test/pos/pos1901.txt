I've been a faithful costumers to Schotzky's for a couple years now. This sandwich shop is located next to a few places I frequent, like Tower Records and Ulta and it is close to the AMC theater so it popular destination for theater-goers. 

I like the smaller-sized portion of sandwiches that Schlotzky's sells and I like how the bread is soft and thinner than most delis.

There are many, tasty and healthy items on the menu like the fresh veggie sandwich that comes with fat-free dressing. There is also a new and awesome, portobello and feta wrap. 

I have sat down to have a meal here many times and the venue is pretty plain, but the place is a deli after all. And by my standards, it is a mighty fine one.
