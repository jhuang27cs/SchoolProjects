We've been here 3 times, moving help pizza (Pep/saus), family dinner (1 ham/pineapple, 1 loaded), and they had a fund raising night for my daughters school (pep), 4 pizzas total, and every one of them was fabulous. I have eaten in and taken out, service was friendly and attentive both ways. I've yet to encounter a rude employee, right on. 
The cheese was melty, the sauce was just right and the toppings were fresh. I will definitely be back
