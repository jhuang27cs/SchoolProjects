What a pleasure it is to find an honest, reliable repair shop in walking distance to my home. Murph is as helpful as he is honest, he guided me to a couple of other shops to rectify some previous inadequate repairs to help me pass inspection. Who does that these days? Car Zone has my business for the foreseeable future.
