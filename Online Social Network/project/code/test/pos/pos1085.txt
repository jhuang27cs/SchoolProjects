I went in here to buy my girlfriend a present for her birthday, and I usually don't like to buy her clothes because she always ends up exchanging them.  However, I ended up walking into Kaitlyn, and the girls who worked there were extremely helpful, and sold me into buying a few articles of clothing and some jewelry which my girlfriend loved! I thought the price was very reasonable since I was ready to pay a small fortune of my small paycheck so props to Kaitlyn on that. Double props for having awesome service and hiring some girls who are verrrry easy on the eyes too.

I will not hesitate to come back again!
