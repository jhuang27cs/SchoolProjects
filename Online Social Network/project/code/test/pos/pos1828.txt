BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD!  It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it!  The half sandwich was somewhat small, but maybe it was because I wanted more...

I had the Brutus, but I'm a vegetarian so I had to go without the Cesar dressing (it has anchovies).  The guy recommended having it with Italian dressing and it was AMAZING!  I will be going back for sure!  The sandwich was warm and fresh and absolutely delicious!  The guys there are nice as well and always willing to recommend something, because their menu is huge (and the names are pretty hilarious).

It's a little hard to find (in the Huang Engineering Center), but the sandwiches were worth it.  And they give you a lollipop!  :)
