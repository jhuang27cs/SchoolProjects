Cheap, delicious, healthy, nice cafe setting. What more do you want from a place in Berkeley? 

$7 large sandwiches / salads. $8 chef salad is enough for two meals. Get anything from this place, you won't be disappointed. All the good reviews are right, people who give this place anything less than 5 stars are... incredibly unrealistic.

So satisfied with this place that I decided to finally write a review on yelp after joining a year ago!
