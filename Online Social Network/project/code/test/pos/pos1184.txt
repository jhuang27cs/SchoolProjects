The Sugar Shack has been giving me the runaround for a couple of months. I have tried to go there at least 4 times, and every time they are closed. Those hours on their website are a lie! Although the last time I tried to go they were probably closed because of construction. 

Anyway, today they were finally open when I walked up! Miracle. They were out of brisket though :( so I got a Texas Two-Step with chicken. The sandwich is pretty big, and $7 gets you the ginormous sandwich, chips, and a soda. The chicken was really good, tender and moist. I got it with jalepenos, pickles and onions; I have to say it's probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Well, except for Fricano's, but they deserve a category of their own. 

5 stars for the food, but 1 star off for not updating their website to reflect their new hours (whatever they might be.) And also not updating their Twitter every day like Chilantro or Coreanos.
