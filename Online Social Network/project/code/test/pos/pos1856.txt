They have the best chicken sandwich pitas, and the hummus is outstanding (I always get a large tub on the side and snack on it for the rest of the week!).  If they had gyros on the menu here too, I'd give up Daphne's altogether!  Other pluses: The prices aren't expensive ($5 - $10/entree), the walk-up counter ordering makes it easy to pick up on the way home, and street parking is never too hard to find.  All in all, great quality food for a good price.
