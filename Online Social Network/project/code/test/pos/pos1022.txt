Love their kibee and the grape leaves. The tabouli (sp?) is great too! This is one of my "must visit" places when I am home from college. :) It is pretty close to my old highschool too, so I used to walk here all the time after school for some quick nosh. Service can be slow sometimes so I recommend take-out!
