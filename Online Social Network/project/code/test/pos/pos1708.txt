It may be an uneven sampling, but of the long-time Princeton residents I know, this is MOST OFTEN cited as their favorite Princeton restaurant. That has to count for something.

I've never taken advantage of the BYOB status, but nearly everyone does, so I'd want anyone considering the place to know about it. 

The restaurant is, for my budget, an expensive splurge. But when you taste the quality of the seafood, it's really, really, really worth it. 

I've only been twice: once I got crab cakes (yum) and once I got scallops (double yum). Strangely enough, I was really impressed with the mashed potatoes as a compliment to the scallops. 

I think, basically, if you order fish cooked in a way you'll like it, you'll be pleased.

The most surprising thing, however, was the fried calamari we ordered. Now, I love calamari. And the traditional breaded, fried, served with marinara never fails to satisfy. But my husband and I decided to try something new at Blue Point Grill. We got the Buffalo Calamari, which is very lightly breaded and drenched in a *sweet* Buffalo sauce (not overly spicy at all), which pairs beautifully with the creamy dipping sauce. I would recommend it to anyone. Anyone. I have dreamed of the BUFFALO CALAMARI ever since and can't wait to go back.
