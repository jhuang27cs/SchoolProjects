I kind of happened upon this place because a co-worker of mine had bought a LivingSocial deal to it and it expired that day. It's a tiny little place (that we actually walked right by - you really have to pay attention to find it!) that is in a super intimate and romantic setting. 

I had never had fondue before, so it was a really cool experience. My boyfriend and I ordered the "Couple" portion of the Coastal Fondue, which was a generous amount of shrimp and scallops for each of us with a Latin Broth (lemon, white wine, and garlic mmm :) It also came with 5 dipping sauces that were excellent - we had to get a side of fries, though, because we were kind of starving. In fact, I recommend not eating here if you are in the mood for whopping portions of food: especially with the high prices!

In any regard, I had the perfect amount of food, the service was excellent, and we got our food quickly. I'd highly recommend this place as an experience restaurant destination!
