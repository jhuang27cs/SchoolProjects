I really like how they jam pack as much toppings as they can on their hotdogs. Love the slippery mess that falls all over your hands, while trying to get some extra toppings (from the toppings bar) onto the already full hot dog. The only thing wrong was that the bacon was overcooked. And there goes that one star. 

I also really enjoy their little mule. Instead of that taste you have when you eat a burger overloaded with cheese and meat, you get different textures from the sauce, the avocado and the egg. 

The fries are decent. 

There is very little outdoor seating, so you can bring your canine friend. :)
