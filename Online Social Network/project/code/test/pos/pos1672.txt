Promise not to tell the hipster girls that hog all the sweet vintage everything, but in the back by the household goods there are four racks of amazing purses. 

I bought 8, no joke. One gorgeous maroon leather Etienne Aiger, a Champagne quilted, chained Chanel knock-off, an awesome square grey 80s vinyl bag, a black 60s clutch, the list goes on. And it cost me $28. Are you listening?! I'd say go, STAT. But I just cleared OUT. Wait a few weeks and go ravage!
