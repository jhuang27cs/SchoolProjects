Best. Fries. Ever.

We ordered an assortment of items and our favorites were most definitely the duck fat fries and crostini with pickled cherries, honey and ricotta. People rant and rave about the poutine, but I personally found the plain ole' fries to be better than those smothered in gravy. To each their own, I suppose.

The GGGinger is among the best drinks I've ever had and I applaud the fact that they have Pimm's on their drink menu.

The bill wasn't as hefty as expected and our stomachs were bursting at the seams when we left, which was a pleasant surprise.
