Tasty tacos!  Mucho picante for all who are not afraid of the heat.  Place is always packed.  They squeeze everyone into tiny tables.  Small price to pay for some well needed Mexican flair in the UPW hood.  Margheritas pack a punch.  So many types of tequilas.  Only sip the best.  Fun vibe with the lucha libre pics throughout.  Outdoor space if you don't want the cramped style inside.  Will mos def go back and explore more of the menu.  Buen provecho!
