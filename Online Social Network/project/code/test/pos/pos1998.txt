Executive Chef Claud Beltran has created an amazing sensual experience of flavor that transcends any experience available in Pasadena.  

The bar is small and highly intimate; an enjoyable vantage point of the inner workings of Noir.  

I ordered solely off the specials menu this evening.  Each dish comes with a pairing suggestion, and when I veered from that pairing, I was disappointed. It was at that moment I realized, listen to the Chef, this one knows what he is talking about. 

Beware of baked apples with salt caramel. This is an experience seared in my psyche.

I may have to try the burger on my next visit. Paired with ZD cab, I am sure one cannot go wrong.

Enjoyable, delicious, great wine list and by the glass wines are amazing.

I was going to take a friend here for the birthday, however I hesitated because I hadn't yet had the experience. Silly me. Silly me.

This establishment is for people who truly enjoy an crave the experience of people and atmosphere, food and wine.
