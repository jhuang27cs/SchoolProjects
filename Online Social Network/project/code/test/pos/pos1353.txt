A brave pioneer purveying high quality food in the wasteland of culinary mediocrity that is Columbia-ville!  

My burger, topped with vermont cheddar and caramelized onions, was delicious.  It came with some gourmet pickles, but as Heather pointed out, no fries.  Probably for my own good, but still, I was sad.  

Where did they come up with this name?  Community Food & Juice makes it sound like some horrible vegan juice stand.  But that will not stop CFJ from quickly dominating Broadway, because it has NO competition in this neighborhood.  What, you wanna go to Ollie's instead?
