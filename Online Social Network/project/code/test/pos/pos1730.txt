Been going there for almost 4 years. Dr. Irwin is very helpful and has a great memory, always catches up on previous year's visits. Great if you work at UT, have insurance, or don't have insurance. If you don't have insurance they have great deals, like buy one, get one free.

Their selection is very good, from modestly priced frames to your expensive high-end models.

Just don't go there on your lunch hour and expect to be done in half an hour. If you set aside time when getting a checkup at a doctor's office, set aside some time to properly check your eyes. I've always gone in the afternoon and have always been helped properly, from my pre-exam diagnostics to finding my frames.

Enter relaxed, leave relaxed.
