Sometimes, when a restaurant is located a little too conveniently close to your home or work or school, it can get booooring.  NOT SO AT ARTURO'S!  It's like my favorite old friend that who I am always happy to see and can never grow tired of.  

They've got breakfast, lunch, coffee, and a friendly, quirky, hard-working staff. who cater to all of the workers and students that are moving through the area during the work-week.  

The restaurant itself feels like a speakeasy in the Prohibition era because it's small and underground.  The art on the walls and the food on my plate always put me in a good mood.  

I'm particularly fond of the black bean tacos.  This usually lowly-food has been elevated to exciting new levels with the help of prodigious amounts of garlic - no kissing allowed after one of these.  I also heart the quesadillas, which combine a plethora of vegetables, sauces, and meats in yummy combinations.  I can rarely deviate from my standards on the menu, but when I have managed to do so, I have always enjoyed their salads and sandwiches.  

This is a good place to get you out of a lunch rut and into a good mood.
