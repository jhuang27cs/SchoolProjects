Thank goodness you've arrived, Clover! I can come knocking on your door and get a quick, nutritious lunch (chickpea fritter, THANK YOU!) for five dollars and get out right away and race to class. Or, I could sit at the gigantic, beautiful wood plank table and read the paper or talk to my friend for an hour. 

With the bright lighting and busy atmosphere, this is a great informal hangout spot, in addition to being very tasty.

The food may be vegetarian, but it is anything but penitential. Other highlights include the rosemary french fries and the hot ginger honey tea. Mmmmm. I just moved here and I already come here at least once a week.
