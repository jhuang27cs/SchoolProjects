The Chow never disappoints, I mean if it does it's kind of your own fault? You pick your stuff, you provide it to the cooks, and they cook it. Brilliant!

Unless your a prickly, snobbish, and nose-up kinda person there is nothing to really hate here. I mean the bar can be a bit untidy and sometimes there is a wait to make your dish, but that's just cause so many folks love this place! The staff is friendly and very efficient.

Those with severe food allergies may wish to dine elsewhere, however they take mondo efforts to make sure those with diet requirements are handled with care!
