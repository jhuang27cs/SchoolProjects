It's just good ol' fashion diner food. If I could my lazy ass to wake up in the morning I'd come here for breakfast. Actually they serve breakfast all day but I'm not that kind of person. It's kind of like Denny's in terms of large portions but it definitely differentiates because it has it's own atmosphere.
