I'm seriously confused at why people hate on this place so much.  Maybe the service/food can be iffy at times, but today it was great!  I hadn't been here in a really long time, so I felt like I had to try the food again to write a proper review.  

We got the "best seat in the house" according to the host.  That actually means the seat by the window so you can people watch.  Everything looks good on the menu, so I opted for a little bit of everything.  I started with the cauliflower soup.  I didn't know what to expect, but it came as pureed with a cheesy taste to it.  It was amazing!  I asked the server what was in it and she said it was cream cheese.  Mystery solved, cream cheese makes everything better!  

I also tried the beat salad.  I loved the fact that there was golden and red beets in it.  I just wish there were more, although I always feel that way about beet salads at restaurants it seems.  The main course was the Walnut Crusted Salmon with Bread Pudding and Apple Buerre Blanc.  It was really tasty.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, which meant not over cooked at all, and the bread pudding/apple buerre was really delish!  

Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and I really couldn't ask for a better meal.  I've been won over and I'd definitely go back...and try ten things again:)
