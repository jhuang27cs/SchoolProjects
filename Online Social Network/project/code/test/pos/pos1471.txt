Chano's is hands-down, my favorite comfort food near USC. Now, to be perfectly honest, there (suprisingly) aren't too many places to get a great bite to eat around campus, as opposed to the nearby Westwood Village school that will remain nameless. Nonetheless, Chano's is a real gem, and if you are brave enough to withhold judgement as you approach the underwhelming exterior, what you will find are some of the tastiest burritos (carne asada is always my default), nachos (piled high with toppings), and chili cheese fries in the city.

It's always funny to me that the place is called Chano's Drive-In, because they have just about the strangest drive-thru I have ever used: the speaker (bull horn?) you place your order through is terrible and it's just about impossible to understand what the order-taker is saying through the loud static (but then again, they've never once messed up an order). And the window through which your carne asada burrito is handed to you is on the right, not the left. Awkward, awkward. 

But those things really just give it more character (I hate eating at cookie-cutter fast food restaurants), and for me, Chano's is an easy 5-star pick.
