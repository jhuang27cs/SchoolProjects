I have stayed at Hotel Deca two times in the lat 4 years and just spent the weekend there. In the past I have had great experiences with this hotel, not only was it comfortable and hip but the staff was incredible.  This last weekend was less than favorable, upon arrival in our room late Friday night we discovered that our AC didn't work and of course it was the hottest week of the year and we were on the 12th floor. We called the front desk but they were unable to do anything about it, their suggestion? open the windows.  Well that  is profound, anyways the windows only open a small crack and don't really allow the air to come in, that coupled with all the street noise we were up all night long in misery. Staff came on Saturday morning to fix the AC but they were unable to do so so they moved us one floor down to another room.  This was nice actually, however it would have been nice to go higher but that is ok.  Our first night there we also experienced an entire floor dedicated to a bunch of young kids from Chicago partying loudly.  Lucky for us they quieted down by midnight.   

When we came back on Saturday night, there was a huge crowd out front with tons of cops and two very large kids having a serious fight.  University district is cool at times, however there is nothing worse than a bunch of drunk frat boys running amok in the streets, not very safe to go out alone after dark.   The free shuttle is a joke, you have to schedule well in advance and buses are far from convenient if you need to return after 9pm.  Cab rides from downtown are close to 20 dollars.  

next time I will stay downtown or on Capital Hill.
