Are you a student? or a roaming passerby?? Are you checking out this so-called "Sushi House" on your iphone or blackberry or droid ?? And you wanna know is it worth it?? Then you better get this warning my asian food lova brotha from anotha nice nice homey motha...

STOP. Do not come here for sushi or rolls or whatever.. if you are Japanese.. you will throw up.. if you are asian.. you will say WTF motha.. if you are a white man.. you will say "my hottie hottie asian girlfriend cooks better than this.." and if you black.. i dont know what you will say..

seriously.. are these the same owners of the Sushi House over in Oakland??  Dont dare call this place Sushi House if you cant hang like the LEGENDARY sushi house over in oakland with 1K reviews..

why do people go here..??
Prices are super high for what they give you..
Rolls SukorZ.. Hella Small.. (not what she said..)
Rolls are bland and do not taste good at all..
Service is whatevers..

so go to Tako sushi man.. they know how to give you food that is properly priced for what you get.. nasty food for nasty cheap prices..

I can tell you what I got.. but why bother? i gave you the jist above.. dont come here unless Tako is closed and you are a desperate motha brotha..
