Where do I start with this tragedy? Okay, I'm overreacting a bit, but simply put: I strongly dislike this Target.

First off, the workers are ghetto, not friendly at all, and they all give off this "I'm just here to get my check" attitude. I'm such a hypocrite because I've done the same, but at least I'm nice and helpful regardless!

Secondly, the selection is not all that. Just basics it seems like, especially in the clothes section! And because of the location, there's nothing but rowdy kids there on a daily basis. Trust me, I know. 

Long story short, this isn't a good Target. Just head to the one in Silver Spring...for
the selection. The workers on the other hand...ehm, that's another review entirely.
