I have been to the spring lake location and it has always been wonderful so I figured Princeton would be the same. WRONG! I had a woman named Star who was assigned to massage me. She had long finger nails that scratched me the entire time. And she was pressing so hard I thought I was going to scream. The pain was so severe (and I didn't come in with a single ounce of pain or anything). I asked her to not push as hard SO many times but she didn't ease up. The whole massage was AWEFUL. I couldn't wait for it to be over (which is sad when I paid so much for the service). I left with horrible neck pain. Overall I was extremely upset and I will never go back!!!
