I've created my Yelp account for the sole purpose of protecting people from this barbershop. Apart from being cold and apathetic the woman running the place has no skills in her profession. My haircut took about four minutes and was totally worthless. A five-yearold with a scissor had done a better job. Conclusion, don't go. Go to Boston/NYC/etc for a haircut.
