well, i popped over from Alameda after reading the East Bay Express reviews and was pretty underwhelmed...I thought the falafel was a bit greasy and don't minunderstand the reviews that say free refills, as that's only true if you get a sandwich with pita...if you get the salad, you fill once and that's it. 

 while some of the stuff was topnotch, like the coleslaw, the brocolli/cauli, and the carrots, alot of it was just plain veggies you'd get at any salad bar for less $.  so with a drink and a little tip, the whole thing was over $10 and not worth it.  

aesthetically, it's all bland furnishings too with hard benches to sit on.  i just couldn't figure all the buzz!
