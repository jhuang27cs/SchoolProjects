Horrible is actually a compliment. This was the worst Chinese food I ever tasted.  The meat (chicken and beef) was dry and had a disgusting aftertaste.  The shrimp was rubbery and the vegetables had no flavor. The egg-rolls were just flaky dough. Even the fortune cookies were stale.
I wish I could forget the entire experience but I fear my tastebuds will never forgive me.
