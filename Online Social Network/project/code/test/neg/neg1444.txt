I went to the WIndsor Street Health Center for a dental appointment and the next day changed my dentist. First of all, they had marked my gender wrong on the chart and spelled my name incorrectly for no apparent reason. I had made an appointment for a cleaning and check-up but, because they only give 45 minute appointments, all they had time to do here was give me x-rays which i didn't even want done really. Now, I have had many dental x-rays in my life, but these were, by far, the most prolonged and painful. For some reason, the dental assistant had to keep rearranging the x-ray paper and pushing the film at awkward angles into my mouth, which cut my mouth several times. The dentist later told me that the assistant had also forgotten to tell me to take my nose ring out which could have caused the whole procedure to have to be redone.

When I finally saw the dentist, for about 10 minutes, she was quite friendly and told me I had to get some fillings redone and my wisdom teeth out. She gave me a referral to get my wisdom teeth out but the sketchy place they referred me to only takes walk-ins which would have meant, she reaffirmed, that I'd have to walk into this place and maybe or maybe not be put under and have my teeth pulled. sketchy. Also, because Windsor Street Health Center only gives limited time appointments, the fillings I had to have redone would have to be spread out over three sessions, each of which takes one month to schedule behind the next. And she said I would probably always see a different dentists since they're continually rotating. So she said she would give instructions on the chart that she hoped the  next dentist would follow. Sketchy!!! No way!!! I changed my dentist ASAP.

In conclusion: Avoid if possible.
