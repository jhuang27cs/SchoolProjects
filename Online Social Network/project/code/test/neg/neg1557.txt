These guys SUCK!

Don't get me around; their attitudes are nice, but they are crooked as hell!
Okay, as part of my DUI program (I got caught for a DUI back in Dec.), I am required to get a DUI device in my car. Lifesaver - and all the ditzes who work for the short, militant man was not working - so called Smart Start Interlock, a co. my lawyer referred me to.

Now, I go in there. dudes are cool, but when I have to blow (for 3 secs.), then BLOW and HUM for 10 to 15 secs. (How the fuck can I sing into a damn interlock device), I almost killed my car (since they wire it to the engine). I DID EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK, EVERYTHING, AND NOTHING BLOODY BLEEPING WORKED! After a WEEK, of having this torture in (and having a good man stop to help me - Thank you to whoever you are for being a gentlemen), I get it taken out. 

So I call on Monday and tell them I need to take this out! I spoke to headquarters first, then I called Abby. Abby concurred and said, "Come on in", to have the device purged from my car! Awesome! So i go in all happy, and the dude there who runs it says, "You can't take it out!" WTF, you two bit double crossing snake! You just said I could! I was f*cking LIVID! They claimed they called HQ's, too. So I get on the phone and talk to the head B*tch in charge (thank goodness for her I forgot her name, I think it was Betty) and she REFUSES to take it out, saying that I have to send a letter saying it is not court ordered. I pull out my contract and say, "B*tch, READ IT AND WEEP. THERE IS NOTHING ON THE CONTRACT SAYING THAT IT IS COURT OR ANYTHING ORDERED". The other bitche$ take it out! But not before one threatened that "A cop will show up at my door as they did another lady". Knowing the law, I said, first off, if they catch you DRIVING, they CAN take you in! Also, IT IS NOT COURT ORDERED, so WTF the cops got to do with this, idiot!" I leave without incident, having to tow my car back since the HQ bytch basically said I would not be allowed to drive it according to her orders. Thank goodness I have triple AAA and they cover me FOR FREE for 7 mile rides! I also had to pay them $180 to out it in and a whopping $230 to take it out (of which the HQ lady gave me a discount after I went Mad Max and proved that the contract PROVED she was BS. 

So I go to Draeger in Montebello, not far from where I take my DUI courses (a POSITIVE review is coming up for them later), and the repair guy finds that, gasp, THOSE BASTARDS AT ABBY/ SMART START PUT THE DEVICE/ WIRING IN WRONG AND DID NOT CUT ALL THE WIRES OUT, WHICH COULD CAUSE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR! I got this on TAPE!  I ought to sue them. 

When you have to get an interlock device, go with Draeger in Montebello (I know I am giving them free advertisement). They are nice, reputable, honest, CHEAPER,  the device only requires 3 to 4 secs AT BEST. Smart Start is a scam. There are complaints all over the internet about them. Avoid Smart Start and avoid Abby's if you want an honest experience!
