The first time I went to this Kinkos I ended up taking my business elsewhere due to a time crunch. I called Kinkos to let them know I wouldn't require their services after all and got a LECTURE about how I really should have told them about my time limitations. The sales associate gave me a hard time and was completely rude.

A few weeks later I was in need of more printing. I went back to the Kinkos (just to give them a second chance.) Both sales associates I talked to were relatively listless and unpleasant. I can generally get by with unhappy people, but the absurd prices drove me away. At $0.49 a print I wouldn't have been able to afford it! Plus they charge 25 cents a minute just to use the computers. When I asked the Kinkos rep if there was another (cheaper) place to go for printing large documents I was told there were no other options (in a gruff and rude manner.) 

I later learned that Staples in Harvard Square also does printing - cheaper, and in a timely manner. Plus the sales associates are ridiculously nice.

Never going back to that Kinkos so help me god.
