WOW. this place is for people who like their food to lack flavor. My boyfriend and I had lunch here. I like salsa with tomato chunks and this salsa was just soupy with a whole lotta cilantro. The chips were whatever. I ordered steak/chicken fajitas. They came out sizzling and i was ready to dig in.... FAIL the meat had no seasoning or flavor. So i thought, Okay I can work around that ill just add a ton of rice and beans on the tortilla and drench the meat with this soupy salsa. FAIL THE tortillas were so hard they were cracking. The rice was so bland ( and i love rice) My bf had enchiladas and these were probably okay just because they were covered in sauce. BIG WASTE OF MONEY
