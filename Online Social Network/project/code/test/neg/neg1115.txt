WTF?!  closed on a saturday at 7pm!?!?!  this is the u-district where the ave is constantly active!  how can you be closed so early on any day?!  what happened to being 24 hours?!  we were headed to eat on the ave and my friend was sick and needed some serious cough medication.  when we got here we found the place dark... had to drive all the way to the one in queen anne since that is the only one i know that is operated 24 hours.  arrgh!

as cathy g. said - this bartells is located on one of the busiest corners of the ave!!  wake up people!!  extend your hours!!
