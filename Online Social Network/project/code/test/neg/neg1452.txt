I bought gas at this place a week ago. After spending 50 bucks on gas, my truck wouldn't start (my battery was going bad). I coasted over away from the pump to clear room for other customers, then I went in and asked the owner if he would give me a jump start. He said, "ask someone else" and turned away. I had to call a friend to come jump my truck. What a jerk! I'll not be going there again.
