Kiwi adheres to the now-standard self-serve fro-yo concept and the shop itself is adorable, but I'm on the fence.

I always go for the original tangy at these places, and I wasn't thrilled (Berryline in Cambridge is my high point), but offers way more varieties that some of the other places, as well as way more toppings so it almost makes up for meh yogurt. The massive bowls (smart move, guys) encourage people to really load up, but I just wanted a taste and it was still over $3.50, which just seems exorbitant. I'm willing to pay that at Scoop De Ville, but not if I'm doing all the work.
