Meh....way overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. I had the Miso Salmon for dinner and it was mediocre at best - definitely not worth $28. We sat outside and since the heaters are all connected, when you turn one off, you turn them all off. We were a bit cold, and asked the waitstaff to turn it on again. Then another table complained that it was too hot, and requested that the heaters be turned off. It was a bit annoying. 

Anyhow, I will not be coming back, as I can easily think of 10 other asian restaurants within the 6 mile radius of Yucca that has more authentic food for half the cost.
