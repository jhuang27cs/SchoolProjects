I have nothing against Burger King, the food is what it is.  However, the service I experienced at this particular Burger King was just awful.  The cashier preparing the orders did not know what burgers went with what order because the guys in the back making the burgers had not marked them.  So one of the guys grabbed a marker and repeatedly jabbed at the burgers to mark them to be funny.  All while at least 5 other customers were watching... It also took them 10-15 minutes to get me my junior whopper.  Should've gone to McDonald's.
