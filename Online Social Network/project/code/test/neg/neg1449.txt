We stopped here for lunch on a recent trip to Seattle to visit the family.  It was only a week ago but this place has already faded in my memory.  I had to ask my boyfriend to remind me which restaurant this was.  It doesn't stick out as great but it also doesn't stick out as particularly bad.  I did get a coupon for checking in here via Yelp on my phone.
