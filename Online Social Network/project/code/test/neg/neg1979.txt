Quite possibly the slowest hibachi cook I have every witnessed. After placing my to-go order, the cook just stood around and didn't start my food for several minutes. My total wait time was more than 20 minutes, and it was a slow time in the restaurant with only a handful of customers, the majority of whom had already received their food.

The issue didn't seem to be with the service staff - they were waiting for the cook to get his act together as long as I was. It was like watching a film in slow-motion.

Food = fine
Service = crap
