Not very tasty, but it's cheap food that gets you filled. I've tried a few dishes here like beef with bitter melon, mapo tofu, and short ribs, but my favorite is their number two special, which is a large chicken drumstick over fried rice with fried wontons. The large chicken drumstick is glazed deliciously with some sort of plum sauce, but the rice is forgettable and bland, and the wontons are sometimes cracked so they leak a large amount of the frying oil which is somewhat nasty.

It's certainly not the healthiest place to live, nor the tastiest, but if your on north side and need a quick eat, TC is pretty quick and cheap.

When you order, you get a small bowl of soup brought out to you which is kinda nice.
