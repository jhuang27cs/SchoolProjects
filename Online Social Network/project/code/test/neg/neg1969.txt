I LOVE POPEYE'S. But this is THE WORST Popeye's I've ever been to in my life. I've been to them all across the country and never experienced this level of fail. 
They almost never get your order right and the sides just don't taste very good. Many times I have ordered mild not once has all of my chick been mild. There are always spicy pieces. I even go back and tell them and they take it and give me spicy again! Just deplorable...

Popeye's is AWESOME...JUST NOT HERE!!

DON'T JUDGE POPEYE'S BY THIS LOCATION
