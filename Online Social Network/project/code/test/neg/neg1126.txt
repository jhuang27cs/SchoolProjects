Came here to study for my final and wow! Not one of my best ideas.

As far as cafes go, the Northside Cafe is "okay", at most. And in terms of a study location, it's pretty bad. There's no Wi-Fi and it's pretty freaking loud! That being said, if you NEED internet, you can try connecting to AirBears, but that'll be pretty spotty at best.

Anyways, as for food, I thought I would just be studying the entire time, so I just ordered a Mango Iced Tea. I was a bit disappointed with the Iced Tea, as it was very watery and tasteless. Not very much mango, if any ):

I really wanted to like this place, but sadly, it just wasn't meeting my needs. Maybe next time?
