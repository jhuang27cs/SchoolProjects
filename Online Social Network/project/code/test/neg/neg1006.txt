Sorry Sprinkles, you have been demoted because your cupcakes are disappointing. Just tried the salted caramel and orange cranberry. Salted caramel is the most expensive dry cupcake I have every paid for. Frosting is definitely required to add moisture. The orange cranberry has a strong orange taste, which I normally love but not in this cupcake, although it is much better than salted caramel. I will stick with banana and not deviate anymore. Banana ftw.
