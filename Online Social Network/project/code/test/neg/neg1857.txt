Yes, the food is tasty, comforting, and traditional, consistent with the cuisine served at the other Pasadena restaurants.  Yes, the service is attentive, warm, and polite.  My issue with Smitty's is not with taste or service, but rather with basic hygiene and quality control.

I've been there several times with my family and enjoyed these dinners.  However, the last time we dined at Smitty's I ordered a braised veal shank on a bed of lentils.  The shank was delicious and flavorful.  The kitchen staff, however, had failed to wash the lentils, and when I bit down on them I cracked a big chip off my front tooth on the chunks of gravel they had left in the dish.

This suggests that despite the pleasant and attractive presentation of the cuisine, Smitty's is lacking in basic quality control.  I had the tooth ground down by my dentist, at some considerable expense, but there's still a chunk missing.  My recommendation is that you avoid this establishment until they get their act together regarding simple things like washing the legumes instead of leaving the dirt in them...I'm not going back.
