I had high hopes for Asian Box - the clean, modern layout, friendly service and simple menu listing fresh ingredients all held so much promise. I am sad to say that the flavors did not deliver. I ordered the tofu over rice noodles with a variety of toppings, and it was bland meets unappealing.  I probably won't go back. I wish it weren't so.
