Let me start off by saying the paninis are 900+ calories and they aren't even that great. They use high-gluten flour and everything is so high in sodium. The pizzas are okay, and the tiramisu is watery and not decadent.

Only reason I give it 2 stars if because the gelato is marvelous! Cookie Sensation is amazing.

And since it's a place for us students, I'm digging the beverages choices they have.
