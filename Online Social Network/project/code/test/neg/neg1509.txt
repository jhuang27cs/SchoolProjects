I totally forgot about this incident, it was a while back.

So I'm there with my buddies from Pub Crawl ... we get there maybe 9:30 on a weeknight? Sit down, get beers, order some potato skins or some shit... 

Then all of a sudden at 10pm, the big guy on staff says, "We're sorry sirs, but it's our policy to card everyone in the joint at precisely 10 pm".

Now I don't get carded most of the time anymore ... and my buddy across from me has a good 10 years on me. And I start laughing out loud. "Seriously, you're carding THIS guy?"

ANyway... I do hope they stopped doing that, it's kind of textbook "buzzkill" behavior.
