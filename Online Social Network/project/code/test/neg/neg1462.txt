You have officially hit rock bottom, welcome and congratulations!  Coming to drink, dance, and get AIDS at Hong Kong is not unpopular since it is always busy, especially on the weekends.  On the bright side, this means your not alone...though you are still disgustingly desperate.  Also, since it is right across from Harvard, there are always some undergrads coming through "The Kong".

This is a volume drinking joint--all the drinks have that bottom shelf feel and taste, that is except for the scorpion bowl.  Sweet, sweet scorpion bowl how I love your delicious nectar, turning even the most border line 2 into at least a 8.5.  The music is top 40s playing, which only makes drinking a better idea.  Once you get that liquid courage flowin' in your bones try a little dancing--don't worry, they will come to you.

No one really knows how many floors the Hong Kong has.  The first floor, and the least vomit ridden one, servers up some delicious Chinese food.  Well delicious may be too strong of food.  Palatable, perhaps.  The fare is what you would expect from the typical lower end Chinese place.  There is a full bar, a big plus.  The yang chow fried rice (shrimp, chicken, pork, egg, etc) is really good, especially if you add some sweet and sour sauce.  The place is open late, cheap, and delivers too.

Hong Kong was recently remodeled, so the inside of the restaurant is looking better, but it also recently had a fire so yeah...

Bottom Line:Stay downstairs and mack on some dumplings and scorpion bowls.  Depending on how you feel about crabs you can then go upstairs.
