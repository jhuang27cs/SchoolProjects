The only thing this place has going for it is the lighting and drink menu. This is a place that tries to be as fancy as a lounge in the financial district but fails. The waitress that was helping my group was aggressively rude and when my group decided to leave after the crappy customer service, the bouncer had the nerve to say some cowardly words to a friend of mine. Wouldn't go back if they paid me.
