I ordered on-line from Chicago Pizza at 9:45 on a Wednesday.  Apparently they were swamped, but the Boston location managed to hold onto my order for 45 minutes before passing it over to the Cambridge location.  The Cambridge location was apologetic when i called 1 hour and 15 minutes after I placed my order.  They said they were putting it in the oven. At 11:21 PM, they rang my phone with my pizzas and a free 2 liter Pepsi--almost 1 hour and 45 minutes after I ordered.  (I hate to break it to you, but I was quoted 45 minutes.  An hour of angry, hungry guests does not go away with a 2 liter of Pepsi.)  All of my hungry guests were about to leave anyway.  I tipped 10% because I don't believe in NOT tipping (it's not the delivery boy's fault), but I tore up the menu and made sure to go everywhere I could to tell people: Do NOT order from Chicago's.  The pizza is mediocre, and the management managed to completely screw us.  I will never, ever order pizza from here again.
