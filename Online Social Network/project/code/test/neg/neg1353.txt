I had a 3.5 star experience for a 4.5 star price.  Hence the the two star rating.  This place used to be a reliable middle of the road reliable 3.5 to 4 star place with a 3 star price.  My $39 steak sure seemed like a five star price but was at best a 3 star experience.  The wine list that used to be a good deal is now 2-3 times retail.  Yes the service and decor are nice but the prices are just not justified for the value given.  And in this economy one hates to feel like they did not get their monies worth!
