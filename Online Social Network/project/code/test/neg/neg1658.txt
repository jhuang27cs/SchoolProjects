When I told the manager when I arrived that they had poor reviews on Yelp and others, she acted shocked that could possibly be the case. I was open minded nonetheless to perhaps a few bad experiences. 

Alas, that was not the case.  As advertised the service was horrendous.  The wine was fine and the appetizers were very tasty suggesting perhaps the reviews were a bit off.  That is until the caesar salad arrived with the one anchovy only flavoring the leaves touching the anchovy and the dressing relatively tasteless.  It did not improve when the grilled trout arrived very greasy and with a funky taste.  Surprising for something grilled.

My companions who had traditional fried food were more impressed with the taste. When I told the server that the trout was inedible, they responded by offering me another dish. I was not hungry at that point so I declined. 

The entertainment came a few minutes later when the waiter returned and asked if I wanted a box for the food so I could take it home and share it with someone else.  Provided a few laughs at the table. The presention was a Gordon Ramsey "what not to do." 

I wanted this to be a better experience. Sadly it was not.
