Word on the street is that this is where the cool kids hang out...

I LIKE:
Convenient to me
Not sheik, expensive, just your typical looking bar (nicer than a real dive)
Reasonably priced, good drinks
They have a pool table! 


DISLIKE: 
Super crowded, hard to find seating
**Rude bartenders - friend lost his bag here, and called the bar the next   
                              day, bartender told him that he should stop being so 
                              drunk so he wouldn't lose his stuff next time (how 
                              would they make money?!)
