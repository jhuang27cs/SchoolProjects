Okay, i have to admit that i like most of their food although i think it is bit pricey. I don't like their service. The waiters are nice and friendly, but when i went there twice, the cashes were very unfriendly and didn't have eye-contacts with me. I know they are busy, but their attitudes were awful. So i complained to them via emails. They friendly replied to me and said, "we will send you a gift certificate as our appreciation" but i have never received it even i sent them my email address. Won't go back.
