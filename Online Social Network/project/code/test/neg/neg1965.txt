The most expensive story I ever told!  We have been working with our daughter for over 3 year on her anxiety using many traditional and non-traditional (read insurance does not cover) protocols.  We were expecting a thorough, multi-disciplinary evaluation of our daughter.  After our initial 1.5 hour consultation for $250 all that we received was a piece of paper with an estimate of 16 hours of additional observation and testing.  All to be performed in 3 hour sessions with our 9 year old daughter and a psychologist.  There is no way my daughter is going to interact with a stranger for 3 hours, let alone 2-3 days in a row.  After further questioning the "recommendation" we learned that they really don't have any approaches outside of the standard child development protocols.  They are really not cost conscious as the estimate included 4 hours to write the report and an hour and a half to explain it to us....all at almost $200/hour.  While I am sure they may be great for some children's challenges, we really just felt they were more of a marketing and administrative organization for a group of psychologists and therapists.  Nothing you can't get from referrals elsewhere.
