The store web site leads with "games & puzzles for adults", and it's no accident. By "for adults", they mean "we're frightened by children".

When my family and a friend stopped in with our two kids the other week, we were immediately "greeted" with a stern comment: "My store isn't child-proof." It was very clear we weren't welcome -- even though the girls hadn't even had a chance to demonstrate their good shopping behavior (we live in the city, so it's not like they've never been in a store before!), and even though we clearly had enough grown-ups to manage if they did suddenly erupt in a fit of rabies or something.

But that's not all. I've lived in the area for a decade, so I've stopped in other times sans kids, and have never been treated particularly nicely on any occasion.

I  can buy the same games at _much_ better prices from small shops elsewhere in the country with an online presence, with *far* better service. I'm having a hard time seeing why we should support a local business when this is what we get.
