WWWWWWWWAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY tooooo looouuuuddd.

I'm fun and all, but this place is obnoxiously loud when they're playing music. You can't have a conversation at all. 

I prefer a conversation to becoming deaf. 

If someone asked me to go there, I'd say "no thanks!" Or, "let's go elsewhere." And I'm fairly easy to please!
