My friend and I decided to try this place ever since it opened and we finally did. It was a major disappointment.

I originally decided to give this place one star which I've never done on any other restaurants, however, I changed my mind to 1.5 and rounded up to 2-star thinking I might was being a little too harsh on it.

I had a salad which I do not remember the name of but it sucked... Looking out the window and seeing Panera across the street, I couldn't help but only comparing these 2 places.

My friend ordered some kind of pan-fried noodle and it was pan-burnt.

I never will go back to this place to eat.
