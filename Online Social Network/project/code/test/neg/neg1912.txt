Sorry to disagree folks- Bodega's is barely above Chipotle! My bf and I have been walking at twilight around Hermann Park (cute, huh?) and almost every time we wanted to go eat after at Bodegas. For some reason or another, we never went because of forgotten wallets, other cravings, etc. But this past Friday we finally got our act together and walked to Bodega's after feeding the ducks, turtles, & nutria's. 

Previous yelpers mention choices- Bodega's doesn't have any pre-designed combo's. Instead, you order cafeteria line style, and you start by picking what you want to eat- tacos, torta, nacho, etc. My bf got 3 tacos (2 crispy, 1 soft) and I got the nachos. Then you pick from a choice of meats such as rotisserie chicken, fajita (beef or chicken), ground beef, etc. Then you choose your dressings- everything from the regulars (lettuce, tomatoes, cheese) to nacho cheese and red onions. Then you pick a dressing to go on top- I can't even remember how many choices there were, with varying ingredients such as papaya, chipotle, habanero, etc. 

I hate these kinds of restaurants!! I always end up picking combinations of items that taste good indivdually, but together are a big mess. My nachos also came in a bowl, and was about 2x as much as I could possibly eat. What a waste.

However, Bodega's does have a selection of aguas frescas, including horchata, limonada, and pepino. I got the pepino (cucumber). Their desserts included flan and tres leches, amazingly I resisted. 

Bodega's offers a full bar, and other patrons were indulging in the big margarita's. But I don't really understand how Bodega's can expect to have any business outside of the M-F 9-5 crowd from the Med Center. The space, however, is huge- the entire side of the building Bodega's is located in has been turned into a patio.
