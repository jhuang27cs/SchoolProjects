We were lured to Crema under false pretenses. Super-friendly staff and good coffee? Not so much. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed and totally apathetic.  

I was excited to see a vegan baked good option, which meant we had to try it.  We split the chocolate brownie ($2.50) and I got an iced coffee.  Although I clearly stated my order was to go, I was handed my brownie on a hot plate. Uhm, I guess we can eat the brownie here? Except hot plate + gooey brownie = meltie mess. And it wasn't spectacular, though few have mastered the art of vegan baking. I guess it was a nice try; Nix the hot plates, though.

And on to the coffee: upon first glance this supposed iced coffee gave me the impression that it may have been iced tea?  Nope, it was just really watered down coffee (is it hot drip coffee poured over ice? Yuck.).  Due to it's weak nature, I made a comment to the barista and asked if I could add a shot of espresso to give it the boost it so needed.  My desire for coffee-tasting-iced-coffee was met with a seemingly pleasant attitude, but as soon as I turned my back my companion noticed the trademark barista-pissed-at-a-customer-for-thinking-they-should-get-what-they-ordered banter. Rad.

And on to the espresso shot: the hopper of the espresso grinder was nearly empty and I could clearly see beans bouncing up and down as they met the burrs.  This means the espresso was not ground well, and this means I was given a fairly poor shot.

All and all a bad first impression.  I do, however, have to commend the establishment for having smaller sizes that are not readily available in this area: a 12oz iced cup and a lack of 16oz cappuccinos are worth recognition.  Also they use Terroir, one of the regions best roasters. 

One more thing: they totally ripped off Bloc 11's decor; only with an Ethan Allen twist.
