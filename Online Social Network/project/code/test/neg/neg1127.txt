Thank god this place closed. I went to Cowboy Sushi on the recommendation of a friend about 6 years ago... and I still haven't forgiven him for it. The Philadelphia Roll was HORRIBLE. Bleh. I still can't have a roll with cream cheese in it because of this place. I should also mention that the meal I ate here made both me and my friend who went with me really ill. Cheap sushi is ALWAYS I repeat ALWAYS a BAAAADDDDD idea!!!
