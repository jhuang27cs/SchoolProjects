Service is so crappy...that itself makes me not want to come here ever again. 

During the day, service is better and they seat you as you walk in and get your order right etc. Food is mediocre...just normal American food. thick fries yadayada..nothing special.

During the night, it gets sort of crazy and nobody wants to help you (WTF we're offering business). It becomes much more self-serve at night. You have to flag down people to get you your pear cider and for them to take your order, etc. 

By the way, seasoned fries + pear cider are the best things. Heard the veggie quesedilla is pretty good and it's a good loud place to go during a game if you don't want to stand in the rain like the suckers in the stadium. Less crowded than Bears Lair.
