I'm with Pete B. -- doesn't live up to the hype.

My parents took us to Escobar's as part of their "see - Champaign has just as good dining as your neck of the woods... promise!!" dining tour.  This was near the top of their list of must-go's.

The food was good, but not great, and certainly not amazing.  At our table, we had:

- Hanger steak asada 
- Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin (got the best reviews, but they still weren't enthusiastic)
- Sesame-crusted salmon
- Sautéed shrimp and scallops

The service was fine, though we were kept waiting for our food for a LONG time.  Plus, all entrées but one came out at the same time, and it took more than five minutes for the last to show up.  I hate when they do that... everyone who has their food wants to eat it but feels they need to wait, and the one person who doesn't have their food is left feeling guilty and telling everyone to start.  No thanks.

Also worth noting:

18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, "for our convenience. " Really?  I've never seen this for under 6, and usually under 8.  This is so they're more sure to get a good-ish tip because they're planning on the party being difficult because of its size.  5 people is not difficult, suck it up.

$4 Split plate charge.  Really?  This is not a hoity-toity enough place to pull this off, even in Champaign.  Thanks for putting it on the menu, though, instead of trying to sneak it in... at least you're broadcasting your shortcomings.

Overall, given the weird choices they make, the good-but-not-great food, balanced with the meal prices (most hovering in the $20 entrée range), it's solidly a two-star experience.  I wouldn't return.
