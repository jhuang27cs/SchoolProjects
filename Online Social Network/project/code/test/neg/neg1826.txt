So i went here on a Saturday and just wasn't impressed. I get it, Saturday morning at a diner are busy. But that is where a diner should shine, be able to turn out a quality product to a large number of people. We are all here because we don't feel like cooking breakfast ourselves. At any rate, I had pretty good service. I ordered the platter with 2 eggs, grits, bacon, and sausage. My food took a little too long to get there, and coffee refills were hard to come by. The food was just ok, with breakfast I feel the quality of the ingredients are the benchmark. In my waiter's defense he had a section on the main floor and had to cover me and a couple who were sitting at the counter. The worst part was getting out, I actually gave up my seat at the counter so a couple could sit down while I waited to pay my check. Coming from upstate NY, i love a good Greek diner. Unfortunately, Plato's wasn't it. There are too many breakfast options in the area to warrant going back.
