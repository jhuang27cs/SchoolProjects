Had I written this review a few weeks ago... this restaurant would've gotten at least 3 or maybe even 3.5 stars... but not tonight.  Tonight I am disappointed and will more than likely never go back.  

I can admit, the first time we walked into this place we fell in love!  The decor is amazing... it's very Tao (for those of you who've been to Vegas)... we didn't try the food but we were sold by the decor.

The second time we went we decided to try some apps... we were less than enthused by the apps but they weren't terrible... not what we expected... but not terrible.

We went back a third time and had their tasting menu... again... not great but not terrible... which is probably not the best way to feel about the place you're seriously considering having your wedding reception at.

And now we come to tonight... we thought we would go tonight for some drinks & apps and really decide if this is where we're going to have our wedding... well, I am just glad we did because WOW were we disappointed.  This was the first time we went on a Saturday night and I swear it was like these people never worked a Sat night in their life.  From customers setting up their own tables to servers putting their fingers ALL up in the plates they were serving us.  The servers were seriously running around like chickens without their heads... it was unorganized and frantic.  An after wedding party had reservations that apparently weren't honored because they themselves had to set up their tables and pull chairs... while the wait staff looked on... it was terrible.  Never again will I go back and NEVER will I consider this place as somewhere to have my wedding reception.
