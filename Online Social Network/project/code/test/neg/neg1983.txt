In a lovely, old house on Newbury Street.  Ambiance is great, except if you're seated next to the bathroom, which we were, even though the restaurant was mostly empty early on a week day.

An interesting menu with lots of dishes we wanted to try.  Unfortunately, service was awful.  Waiter hardly gave us attention when he was taking our order and, as a result, got our order wrong.  The manager was gracious and comped us the dish we didn't order, but overall this wasn't the pleasant family dining out experience it could have been.
