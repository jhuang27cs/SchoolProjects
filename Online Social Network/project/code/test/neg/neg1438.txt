Reasons I won't stay there again: 1) the shuttle service to Cornell and the airport is spotty; 2) the cost of cabs to/from the hotel and Cornell and/or the Commons is way too $$$, especially, since the cab drivers tend to pick up and drop off others along the way; 3) It's cold and after about 5 minutes of using the heater it switched to the fan and then wouldn't turn off - ultimately they moved me, but it took forever to get the new room warm; 4) I couldn't warm up with a shower b/c there was no hot water... in either room; and 5) when I took the heater cover off to see if there was a shut off, I discovered they don't believe in cleaning the vents. gross... no, really. gross.

This hotel deserves a one-star. But I liked the new bedding - very comfy. And I liked the Front Desk staff - definitely solid service on their part.
