My 10 year old and I sometimes like to stop in at Max's as he gets a kick out of eating at a place with his name. Today will be the last time we do that.
I do not know if our standards have changed but the food is just meh! and clunky old fashioned food. I had the small Chinese chicken salad. The fried peanut crusted chicken is awful and the dressing bland  and uninteresting. My son, never know to pass up a burger barely touched the burger and said that it was tasteless. We actually had to ask the guy for bread for our table as well. Just not a great experience
That is the last time we go there. I should have insisted we try the bakery next door.
