2-1/2 stars. We were the first customers for Monday night dinner service; nevertheless, the appetizer sampler (all deep-fried) included oily eggplant.

The dumplings were better but not very hot when served, while the wrappers were too thick with little filling inside.

Overall the food tasted bland and felt overpriced.
