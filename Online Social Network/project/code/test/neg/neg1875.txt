I was meeting up a friend for lunch before she left for NY and originally w were going to get dim sum at yum yum cha in the village but she was running late so she wanted something fast.

She suggested La Madeline...the location in the village...

I had been to La Madeline before and was never blown away so I  was already not too crazy about the pick.

I circled the block a couple of times before finding a parking spot.  Then when we entered we journeyed into a place of chaos.

It was just way too hectic.  You had people who had never been here and others who were veterans.  So there was pile ups at the beginning of the line where people were looking at the menu, then again at the order station, and during the line picking up items.  Just like normal Houston traffic other people got annoyed and tried to pull off and go around, this caused even more confusion as they tried merging back into the line.

After we ordered and paid before we could find a table our food was following us around.  

Overall, this place is a fail.  They have their ordering and delivery system in disarray.  Please fix!
