i love books.  i love used bookstores.  but.... i hate english majors with bad attitudes.  this place is relatively organized compared to some of the other used bookstores around.  but the first time i went there i was looking for a kerouac book and after searching the store i asked the guy behind the counter who very snottily informed me that "the beats are kept behind the counter"  yeah they buy books, yeah they have cats, but will i go here if i'm not desperate?  not likely with magus books right down the street
