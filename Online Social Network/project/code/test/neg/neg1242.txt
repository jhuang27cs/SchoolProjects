I'm one to travel around looking for good pastries, so I definitely had to try this place since I attend UW.  After class, my friend and I ventured off to Mee Sum Pastries to get some goodies for everyone to celebrate the Lunar New Year. When we got to the place, we found that the selection was quite limited...as in a selection of about 4-5 different pastries (which didn't include the essentials such as egg tarts and they only had 1 coconut bun left..what the ef?). Once we finally decided on what to get, my friend ordered first. Everything seemed to be just fine, although I did find the place quite expensive for just a few pastries.

Well, now it was my turn to order; I requested 4-5 pastries plus a Moon cake. A different girl behind the counter helped out the girl taking the order. When she handed me my bag, there were only 2 pastries inside -__-  I quickly got that problem resolved but then the girl asked me if I had gotten my cookie yet. Hmmm.. Cookie??? I told her no, and that I had wanted a Moon Cake, not a cookie. This conversation went back in forth as she insisted that I had ordered a cookie, asking things such as "Oh, so you no longer want the cookie?"...I told her no several times and that I had ordered the Moon Cake to begin with!

  ...Cookie and Moon Cake don't even rhyme or come close to sounding the same!!! Anyhoo...I paid the difference. Oh and I almost forgot. After I paid, the girl asked me if I wanted my receipt, and I said yes. Immediately after she said "OOPS! I accidentally pressed cancel!" So...Please do not ask me if I want a receipt if you had no intention of handing it to me!!!

Overall, the pastries weren't bad, but the service and cost of just a few pastries just doesn't make it worth the trip there. I'll stick to the places in Chinatown and Canada thank you.
