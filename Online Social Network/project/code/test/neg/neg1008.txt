HORRIBLE! Just got my hair done today and was thoroughly disappointed. I was asking to get my hair cut a certain way with layers and the lady would not do it and would just say "It won't look good."  I believe the lady was in a rush and didn't want to fix it.  She cut my bangs straight across which made me look like I was a little girl. I would not recommend this place at all.
