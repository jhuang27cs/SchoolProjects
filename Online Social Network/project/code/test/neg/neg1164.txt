Beware the gyros (or lack thereof) "lunch" sham-a-lamma-ding-dong. I ran in here because A) I had about 2.5 seconds for lunch and it was the first place I drove past that looked decent on the Drag and easy to get in/out of fast and B) I had vague fond memories of the pizza back when I lived here  seven years ago. 

I ordered the chicken gyro "lunch" because I didn't have time to wait for a pizza, and I thought it would be a little bit healthier than something deep-fried or slathered in cheese. Little did I know, when i opened my to-go bag back at my desk, that they only issue you one paltry gyro with  no sides and some just-ok cucumber sauce. ONE gyro. Did you get that? Why so stingy there, Mr. Ebenezer Milto?? I just shelled out like $8 for this bitch. And it wasn't that great. Meat was good but the pita was chewy and doughy. Even the Diet Pepsi (well of COURSE they don't have Diet Coke!) was flat. 

I noticed that it was right at noon and yet there was only one occupied table. At the time, I thought this was a boon because I was in such a hurry. Now, I think I know why, if their pizza is as much of a ripoff as the chicken gyro was. It makes me want to call over to Greece and have some real Greeks pelt 'em senseless with large meatballs and kalamatas. 

Plus what's up with it trying to be an Italian joint AND a Greek joint? Obviously they're not doing the Greek part right; they might as well devote themselves to one and quit trying to multi-task. Because that's not working out too well.
