The hotel itself was fine. My room seems to have been updated fairly recently or else it has held up well. However, the breakfast buffet was well below bad and I had to pay to get it. The scrambled eggs were watery, the bacon could not possibly have come from a pig and seemed microwaved not fried and I was barely able to choke down the one piece of what appeared to be pineapple. I actually have low expectations for a breakfast buffet but I don't think they could have offered a worse spread than what I ate.
