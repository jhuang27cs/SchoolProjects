Om reminds me of the place Tom Colicchio skewers in his Diet Coke "On Taste" commercial ("No frills...No shrimp nests"). Our meals came out with such flair--I, for example, had a pyramid of tofu--that it made the dinner feel more like culinary satire, especially when the food turned out just OK. Add that to an hour waiting for a "20 minutes, tops" table and a waiter who literally glowered at us when we told him we weren't ordering alcohol or dessert, and I don't think I'll be coming back here.
