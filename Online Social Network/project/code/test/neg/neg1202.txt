I'm not going to lie--going here I felt like I was slowly becoming less of a man. I went with a friend (lady friend) who came here several times before. I'm not sexist (well... maybe I am a little), but this place is perfect for girls nights out. I was one of maybe three guys... one of the guys was working as a waiter. The other was drinking at the bar. (I may be exaggerating a little... but seriously, there was a lot of estrogen in that restaurant). The servings are small (more like tapas). They have a good selection of white and sweeter wines.

The food (appetizers) was pretty terrible... their garlic fries were ok, but their nachos were absolutely horrible. I'd take nachos from Taco Bell over their nachos. I couldn't afford an actual meal here... Their drink selection for happy hour was pretty poor (though their wine list was fairly extensive, but considering the restaurant name, it's to be expected)...

All in all, I say go to Palomino's down the street for their better selection of food. Their drinks are so-so, but still not worth it. Their good service is what saves Napa Valley Grille from a 1 star rating. 

In summary: for a girls night out.... have fun, but don't expect me to go. Ever.
