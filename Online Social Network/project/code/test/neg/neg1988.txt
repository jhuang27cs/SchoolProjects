Forgive me for reviewing before dining here but I was so appalled at the behavior of the person on the phone today that I had to chime in.  I bought a LivingSocial coupon for Brasserie a few weeks back.  There are no restrictions written on the coupon but when I called to make a reservation for Valentine's Day, they told me I could not use the coupon on that day.  When I pried, the person on the phone rudely said "it was the owner's choice.  I don't know about the rules.  It was the owner's choice.  Speak with the owner".  When I asked for the owner, he said he wasn't there and to call back between 9 and 10 am.  I asked if I could leave a message and have the owner call me and he said no, call back.  I asked again if the owner could call me and he said "I'm going to hang up on you now."  And, he hung up on me!  I could have easily become a repeat customer and now I will NEVER patronize this restaurant.  I even called LivingSocial to get my money back.  There is no reason to be so rude with a customer, especially when they are in the right (there are truly no restrictions on the coupon).
