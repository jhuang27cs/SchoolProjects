I've only tried breakfast here, the breakfast burrito and the egg and cheese bagel. Both were flavorless and disappointing. I get that this is a "healthy" cafe, but this is the kind of place that gives "healthy" a bad rap. Salt can go a long way even in small amounts, something this place doesn't seem to understand. The lettuce and tomato on my bagel sandwich were also old. All in all, i would not recommend coming here unless you know something that i don't.
