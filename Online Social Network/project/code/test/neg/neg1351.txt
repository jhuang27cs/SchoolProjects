Sweet is not the correct name for this store. They should call it TOO sweet. I've been to the one in Cambridge as well as this location. Their cupcakes are pretty and petite but when it comes to taste, their frosting is way too sweet. Bf and I always like to try different flavors but we always get the signature red velvet and everytime we go to Sweet, I don't know why we go back for more. NYC's crumbs is def. 50x better. Don't bother wasting 20+ dollars for a half a dozen.
