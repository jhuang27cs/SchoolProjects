A FLY or gnat in my OJ/Carrot Juice drink did it big time. The Chicken pita sandwich was not bad but the chips were pretty stale.  I felt really healthy eating here but at the end a huge fly in my drink. COME ON!!!! My girl is upset and all they could say was oh that happens sometimes because of the FAN in back. Say Whatttttt? I wanted a gift certificate or refund. Some gesture to prove they gave a crap.  I guess if you like flies in your drink and the management could care less this is your natural insect place.  I have high standards and would be afraid to check out the back this place. Yuck!
