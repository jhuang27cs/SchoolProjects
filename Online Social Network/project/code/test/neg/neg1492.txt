ollie's works just fine if you happen to be at columbia university and need a quick bite. the food is perfectly acceptable but nothing special. on that basis, i would have given it three stars. the problem though, is this busy eatery feels kind of dirty. 

you wouldn't really feel that if you were doing takeout. but the last two times that i ate there, i sat at the back of the restaurant. from there, i got a full view of the bathroom doors, and the messy stack of spare chairs, etc.  -- this restaurant need to be a little better organized.
