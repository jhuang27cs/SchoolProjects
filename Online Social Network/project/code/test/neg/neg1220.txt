I really dont have much to say about this place. Extremely underwhelming. Paella is always tasteless and overcooked. The tortilla is rubbery and also has no taste, seemed like the potato was undercooked and the egg was overcooked. The rest of the tapas are pretty much the same, no flavor, extremely small portion. Sangria is decent, but really, does it take much talent to make a carafe of the stuff? Service is ok, I don't understand how this place gets so many great ratings.
