1.absolutely awful chicken tikka masala. It really did taste like stew like another person mentioned.

2. The rice stuck together and was not basmati rice that came with the dishes that we ordered.

3.  We ordered an appetizer of pakora and it was drizziling in oil and the vegetable was actually only sweet potato or carrot not even onions. It was so awful.  When I touched it, my hand became so oily just by touching it.  So be careful when you order pakoras, you might end up eating drizzling in oil sweet potato/carrot pakora.

4. We went in expecting good service  when you go to a restaurant. There was only 1 other couple in there so they were not busy.  We ordered our food and after awhile, 3 separate groups of people walked in.  They took their orders also keep in mind we had already ordered. I was so shocked when everyone else food came out before ours even though they all had come after us and here we are still waiting. By this time, I was so upset but did not show it. They totally ignored us while serving everyone else who came after us. I dont know if ethnicity played a role or not but looks like it did and that is sad because we were the last to be served even though we were the first to order and enter when the restaurant was empty with only 1 other couple. The waiter did come out and say our food will be out soon but never came until everyone else was served.

5. They lost our business for sure and there are too many other indian restaurants to get great service and food. We are great tippers and would have easily left a good sized tip even if food was bad but did not due to serving others while we waited and waited and being ignored. 

6. This restaurant needs to serve all its customers in the same manner, not just certain customers.
