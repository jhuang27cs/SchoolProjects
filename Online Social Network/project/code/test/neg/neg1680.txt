I have eaten here a few times and never been overly impressed with this place. Last night, I ate here and ordered the Tomato and Pesto grilled cheese.  Huge mistake.  My grilled cheese came out with one slice of hard, dried to the bread, cheese on two huge pieces of Texas toast.  It was so dry I had to ask for marinara sauce to dip it in just to choke it down.  So not worth it- flavorless and disgusting.  Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there.  OK for drinks, but avoid the food. Oh, and don't bother complaining to the GM, Andy.  He could care less. Way to keep customers.
