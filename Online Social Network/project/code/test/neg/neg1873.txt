ok if the california rolls are bad, you know this place must suck. california rolls are so simple to make, even the average ones that normal fast food places have make are better. 
the first time i ate here i got the teriyaki chicken i think. average taste, they ran out of sushi. i got a stomachache afterwards.
several months later decided maybe to try it again, got the bento A or B or whatever. it tasted like the crappy chinese food thats for sale for $1 after 6pm because its the end of the day and they have to clear out the stuff. the california rolls SUCK. AND GUESS WHAT. another stomachache.
not coming here anymore. well maybe for the alcohol. but thats it.
