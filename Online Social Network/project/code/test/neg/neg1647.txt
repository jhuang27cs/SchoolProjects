On a Tuesday evening, after work, I decided to stop by and order the regular sized watermelon boba for 5.70

- Small. Seating limited yet enough during the time. Free Wi-fi
- No USC discount fail. They want you to have more likes than UCLA but don't hook it up!? lame
- No grand opening fail. They opened one at spring mountain in Las Vegas and if you check in you get 10% off. They also have a BOGO deal.
- Nice way to take advantage of rich students or extremely in debt ones.
- Cash only. ATM fail. 1.50 fee.
- Real watermelon. eh, alright. 
- Don't come here. I suggest Tastea. Fresher watermelon. Better boba. larger size. BETTER VALUE. But it's too far for you, so you're SOL. lol
