Oh Gypsies! You're so lucky to be the most convenient pasta place for Berkeley students to dine in. But alas, your food is too rich! I'm not a health nut, but seriously lay off the pints of cream! Food averages $6-7, while the calzone is a little bit more. The calzone is a little deceiving though... it might seem huge, but in reality, it's about 50% air. It's still quite filling either way.

One more problem... my friends and I have found hair in our food during more than one occasion. We should have learned the first time around right? Overall food is acceptable if you want to try the hairy roulette of luck.
