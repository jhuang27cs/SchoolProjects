Fapm heeses. FIne ines. Hearth.

If you're like me, you read these sad, faded signs on the exterior, and can see that Full of Life is a shell of its former self. Come on, lets address the elephant in the room. Full of Life used to be GREAT!! Now its tended by a family that has no interest in bread. In cheese. The menu is BLAND as hell. Look, if I want a boba, I'll go to Temple City, Arcadia, Rosemead, etc. Bring back the quality food, service and sense of community. This used to be a bakery, right?!

Also, Cheese Cave's sandwiches are much better, so you are losing that business guys. Time to up your game.
