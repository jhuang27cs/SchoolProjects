I've gone to Tommy Doyle's twice now for a group outing. Both times, I sat down with my group, everyone at the table ordered, and the food was delivered fairly promptly. Except mine.

Both times my order was lost or never put in or something. Both times, it took me over an hour to get my food. Meanwhile, everyone else at my table had received their food, consumed it, ordered, received, and consumed dessert. All I wanted was a veggie burger--not exactly a high maintenance order.

Both times, the waiter was very apologetic and kind, and did not charge me for my food. The first time, I appreciated it. The second time, I just wanted to get my damn food when the rest of my table got theirs. In addition, both times my beer order flew off the radar as well, so I ended up going to the bar and ordering drinks there in order to actually have at least SOMETHING to put in my stomach.

I have stopped ordering food when I go, and just eat some quick takeout beforehand. Without the food order issues, I've been getting my beer promptly and without problems, so there's that.
