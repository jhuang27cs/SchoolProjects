Not worth the money.  I am sure you can stay at a even nicer hotel for less.  Yelpers here mostly said they had good customer service, but I didn't.  Maybe it was because I checked in really really late in the evening and the lady at the desk was just grouchy.  Customer service is number #1 on my list.
