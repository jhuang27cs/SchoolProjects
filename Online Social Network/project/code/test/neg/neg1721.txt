Good day to you Sir.  I said good day!   

The dobie is close to me, and when my plans fell through I rushed over to catch the 8:30 showing of the new Tarentino film.  It was blurry!  The film was clearly and awfully out of focus everywhere on the screen but the center.  I asked someone to check the focus.  No dice.  When I gave up the headache inducing film to leave for a refund, the very nice counter girl said they've had this problem and had complaints, and the other guy just gave me that questioning, singsongy "Really, I didn't see a problem".  No pass for my trouble was given.

What is even worse, has society reached such apathy where they will sit placated by corn syrup water and popcorn and watch an out of focus film for 2 1/2 hours?  Perhaps this book is in order:  http://www.amazon.com/Year-Movies-Mans-Filmgoing-Odyssey/dp/0060937866
