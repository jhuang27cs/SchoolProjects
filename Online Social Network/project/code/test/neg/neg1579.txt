I was excited when Kazama opened and have dined there several times.  However, I am not wowed.  Though some of the rolls are good, they are very expensive compared to comparable or better nearby sushi restaurants.  On a couple of occasions, the fish has tasted fishy (old).  My favorite rolls include the Super Salmon and the Dragon Roll.  However, now that King Kong has opened down the street offering large, fresh, tasty rolls, for very reasonable prices, I'm not likely to be visiting Kazama again any time soon.  Both King Kong and Shogun in La Verne offer better variety and value.
