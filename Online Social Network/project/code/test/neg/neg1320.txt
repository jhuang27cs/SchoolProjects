I have eaten at this Wagamama twice in the last 24 hours. The best I can say is that they have phenomenal sorbet, a stellar coconut ice cream, and servicable main dishes. It wasn't bad, really, it was just super bland and not at all complex. I tried one of each type of meal because I was sent here to check it out to see if a big party would be fun. 

The service was terrible, I counted 7 mistakes including sending our whole order to the wrong table. Our starter came out WITH OUR DESSERT!! The waiter openly admitted that the handheld pcs are impossible to use and order with. And overall the prices are just way too high for the quality of food. And throughout the meal there were drink problems- beer came for sake, sodas werent refilled, green tea was cold the second time. 

Great atmosphere, great presentation of every dish, but totally bland food and lousy service.

It was a really strange experience.
