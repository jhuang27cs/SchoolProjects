This place is a total dump.  The office is small and dirty, which also applies to their selection.  I recently brought my car to get serviced at the dealer next door and they set me up with a car from Enterprise.

The only good point about this place is that it's conveniently close to the Porsche, Audi, and VW dealers.  That's it, no other redeeming qualities to note.

The staff was not professional at all.  There was a line of people waiting in this very small office and 3 employees were loudly talking about where they should get lunch while only 1 other employee was servicing customers.  When I was finally helped, they walked me out to look at their selection.  Dismal is the only comment I have.  All the vehicles were older models and all dirty.  Thankfully someone brought in a vehicle from another Enterprise so I was able to get a newer vehicle.

If it wasn't for the fact that the dealer comped my rental while my vehicle was being serviced, I can assure you I would never rent from this location ever!
