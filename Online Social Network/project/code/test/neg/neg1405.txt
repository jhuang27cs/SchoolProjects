Do not go here. I have been a patient for years, due to laziness and due to the fact that I have required little care beyond xrays and cleaning. However, it is true that it is a dental mill, with a very impersonal atmosphere. I had the worse experience ever with a dental hygenist. She actually showed me some bloody food particles. Talk about being scared straight! There's no need to scare someone this way, as if dental visits are not bad enough.  I do plan to write to them, not that they would care.

While I know that I should floss more often, I have never had such a bad experience before during prior cleanings.  The dentist even complimented the health of my teeth prior to this cleaning!
