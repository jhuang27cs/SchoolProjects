Not a huge fan. They're new to Harvard Square and there was a lot of hype with their 1/2 off grand opening.  I got the large Chicken Parm sub meal . It was huge, but nothing special. The chicken wasn't breaded like a chicken parm should be - and the sauce was mediocre at best.  I wish them well, but won't be returning as their are far better options in the area.
