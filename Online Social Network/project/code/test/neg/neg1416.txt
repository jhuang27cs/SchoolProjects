Pros: The coffee's ok, I would rather spring for Starbucks though. I've never had the sandwiches, but my coworkers are a fan of their breakfast sandwiches. Thai Chicken curry soup is yummy. 

Cons: Some of the staff is friendly, but they are mostly the pretentious type that believe because they are working in an organic-vegan-like coffeehouse that they are much better than the folks that come in. They are annoyed if you ask a single question. 

Foods a plus, just remember if you want to know their soup or sandwich of the day, don't call because you'll just be yelled at for not checking their Twitter page first (The one they update once a week and doesn't usually contain that days specials anyway)
