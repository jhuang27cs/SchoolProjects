Denny's is open late, ok if you're cramming for finals and need a change of scenery.  I feel some can be passable, but at this particular one, for the love of god do NOT expect to get good food.  Stick to milkshakes.  Almost everything is fried, drowned in oil, heavily salted, and smothered with an unidentifiable butter- or cream-based sauce.
