growing up near the 626 area, I've been spoiled by cheap and dericious asian food. Noodle Planet just does not make the cut in my book :/. Everything I've had there has been mediocre at best, not at all authentic tasting, and though not super expensive, the price is not worth the quality of food there. The noodle soups here are just ok and i'm not used to the pad thai they serve here. The flavor is very different, the noodles are much narrower, and the noodles are too fried for my liking

I've also only received very poor or nonexistent service when dining there. I distinctly remember having to wait at least half an hour after asking for the check to actually get the check... and it wasn't even close to being busy in the restaurant.

The food isn't bad, but it's not a place I would drive out for. Now that I am no longer living in the westwood area, I doubt i'll be returning here again.
