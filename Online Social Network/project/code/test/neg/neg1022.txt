I wish I could give negative Stars! It was court ordered  that We began seeing Dr. Doyne in 2010. I was optomistic  thinking He would be a help for me and my two young boys.  Dr. Doyne has cost me in every possible way.  He has made every single part of the custody issues more difficult, Tens of thousands have been spent. I can say from my experience Dr. Doyne in no way wants to fix problems, He merely wants to keep bringing you in for those 90 minute sessions. he has created problems that never even existed in the past.   I would use ANY other mediator than Dr. Stephen Doyne,  If this post helps even one family avoid this man's unethical tactics it was worth writing it.
