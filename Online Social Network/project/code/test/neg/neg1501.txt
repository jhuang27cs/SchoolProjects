Hi!

I'm over 40 and not a size 4 anymore, so clearly I am invisible to anyone who works at H&M. Oh wait, never mind, even if you are 16 with daddy's charge card and you are the only one in the store the 18 sales assistants will totally ignore you, so don't lose sleep over it.

Cheap, cheerful and expect it to last one season. 

Once you have those lowered expectations you will be fine.
