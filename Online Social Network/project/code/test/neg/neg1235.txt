I truly don't understand the 4 star rating this place has. I don't rate on service because of how it can vary from employee to employee and day to day. My review is on the food alone. 

I am a pizza connoisseur and have tried pies all across the country with so many different toppings I have lost count. Emmas seemed poised to introduce some new combinations and inventive recipes but it ultimately fell flat. 

The first time I ordered from here I ordered the oft-mentioned sweet potato pizza. As cool and creative as it sounds.... the sweet potatos are just too mushy to make for a good topping. As another reviewer mentioned, the carmelized onions taste like pure sugar and really take over the flavor of this pie. The pizza tasted like a sugar pie with a mushy texture. Not impressive. 

Nevertheless, my faith in yelp forced me to give emmas another try. I was sure that maybe the sweet potato pizza just wasn't my style and this place had to be good. For my second go around I ordered the Italian sausage pizza. Again they piled it up with carmelized onions and I really lost all of the other flavors. The crust and sauce seemed to be good and the sausage was well seasoned and cut just right. I believe this pizza could have been decent without the onions but it would have only been good and nothing special..... Which is a problem because.... The price.

I am not sure why a pizza should cost nearly $20 when they only offer one size. The pies were way too expensive and it added to the poor arrangement of toppings.

I really wanted to like Emmas because it was close to my hotel and as I mentioned.... I love pizza. It fell flat in a couple of ways and I feel sorry for the reviewers who claim this is the best pizza they have ever had.
