I stopped in for a quick lunch and was disappointed by what I got for the price I paid.  I ordered a Tempeh Reuben for 11.75, and it was way too small with a meager house salad on the side.  Everything on the menu is over-priced.  A RFD Burger with the works is almost $15!  I expect a reuben to be huge if I'm paying more than $10.  This was my first time trying tempeh so I can't comment on the quality in comparison of what "good" tempeh is like, but it seemed on the bland side.  I liked the bread it was served on, which is baked in the restaurant's off-site bakery, I found out.  The service was friendly, but my sandwhich took about 15 minutes to arrive and the restaurant was not too busy.  I was thinking that this meal would have cost me $4 at the most to prepare myself at home.  I wanted to support a local vegan restaurant, but Real Food Daily does vegan culture a disservice by making their menu overpriced and not incredibly tasty.  I will seek out cheaper vegan cafes in the area rather than return to this restaurant.
