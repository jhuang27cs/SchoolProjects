One sentence wraps it up: You get what cheap stuff you paid for. 

Worst Dim Sum I've ever had. The har gow and sui mai was totally from one of those pre-prepared frozen boxes you get from Ranch 99 or something. Nothing tasted fresh. In fact, most things came out luke warm which means they didn't even re-heat it all the way. If you have a weak stomach and a love for dim sum, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! It's always really isolated and creepy. There was no one else eating there except me and my friend. It was very uncomfortable having the owners/waiters constantly staring at you. 

But it was super cheap. But I'd rather fork out an extra few bucks to get something much more worth my while.
