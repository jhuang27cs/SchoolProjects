SO. Before start rambling why I gave a 2-star review, I have to say that Elysee used to be my favorite bakery. I don't know what happened to this place--perhaps they changed the owner? But I really had this unpleasant experience today, and I made up my mind of not coming back, EVER.

I came in the morning, trying to catch a breath btw work and reading and errands. I had what I would order usually--omelete, espresso, and a cake. Well, to be honest, the cake was like before--not so good, not so bad. Omelete--worst time ever. Besides all that, I don't think people work here or run this place understand what "service" actually means. I had to repeat my order three times before I could finally sit down while holding my bag my laptop and a magazine; right after I sat down, well, I was called to pay--immediately as the cashier said--and she didn't even say "excuse me".

Anyway. Super f*king busy Friday morning with a lowsy brunch, well, I could live with it.
