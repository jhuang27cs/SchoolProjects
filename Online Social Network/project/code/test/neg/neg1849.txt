i first saw falafel's on the food network with guy fieri on diners, drive-ins and dives and thought it looked so good... i just had to try it. when i found out that westwood has a couple of places that serve them, i couldnt decide where i wanted to have my first falafel experience. luckily i have a friend who knows this Mediterranean place on sepulveda that made a mean fallafel. too bad i cant say the same for this place. the falafel patties were a bit dry and flavorless and the guy behind the register barely spoke english, so i found myself asking him the same question over and over again when finally i said, "just give me a falafel."

i do like that they have a condiments bar where youre free to put on your own toppings. the spicy sauce was really spicy which i loved. another plus was that they offer a "bruin special" to cater to us po' college students, but that doesnt make up for the dry falafels.
