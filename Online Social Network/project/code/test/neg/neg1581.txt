I go to Harvest because it's close by, and, well, I consider it an extension of my good neighbor program. It's for a good cause, I'm sure. The produce is an expensive, sad display which has me believing it's winter all year in New England. The staff look like they need some Prozac.

Tip: Clip coupons in their independent-grocer booklet, which they send monthly to members and distribute from a rack in the front of the store. It's the only way to make this place even remotely affordable.
