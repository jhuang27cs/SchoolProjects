This place has undergone a couple of changes in management over the years and unfortunately, the food has suffered.The garlic fries of yore are no longer. The sandwiches and entrees are $10+, which is hard to swallow for lunch (really wish they had a special). 

Overall, from the name of the place, you might assume it's Greek-- they have some food with Greek flavors (balsamic) but otherwise it's straight up American. They have some excellent patio seating though, and they have a nice location in the heart of westwood- hope they can capitalize.
