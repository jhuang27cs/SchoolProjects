Ok, this is kind of a mixed review. 

I have been here 3 times now. 

The first two times I had a great experience... Both times were quite a wait to get a table (it's a hugely popular place, so I understand), and if you're the type of person who goes to a restaurant to chat with the wait staff forever then you won't like this place... they are pleasant, but hurried... very to the point. I personally hate when wait staff is too into checking on my every 2 minutes, so I really like that they give you room to eat in peace.  

The food has always been exceptionally delicious whenever I have been here... portion sizes are kind of meager for what I would expect a 10-14 dollar burger to be, but it's good quality at least. 

Now for the ugly... the most recent time I went here (last Wednesday) I got EXTREMELY bad food poisoning from a burger being undercooked (I order medium-well, it didn't seem terrible far from there, maybe medium?). I was sick for 17 hours straight... as I said extremely bad. Needless to say it's really put me off eating here again.  

Overall I would tell anyone who goes here be careful how you order, but in general it's a good place.
