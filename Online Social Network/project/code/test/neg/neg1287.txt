Ayami h.!
You gave me the Phytomer gift basket that I won! And you were right, that product is much better than Dermalogica.

I have another review and this one is not so great. After I got undressed and into the towel, I sat on the table to cover up. The table wobbled and tipped toward the head of the table and I found myself looking at my bottom and noticing that I really should have booked a bikini wax, too!

I saw Julie for a facial and this time she seemed to be rushed, left the room for long periods of time, a half hearted effort to extract my skin and I  wasn't as refreshed as I was after my first visit. 

I told Julie that my back was sore because of the back flip and she apologized and shoo'ed me on my way. I knew that it would be fine...later, but that wasn't how I'd like to be treated. 

All this and no steam room?
Amadeus has seen the last of me!
