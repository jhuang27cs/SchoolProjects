This is what I wrote into Michaels.com so they know what is going on:

To Whom it may concern:

I wanted to write in and let you know that I have experienced really poor customer service at your store as well as on the phone.  The individual who answers the phone is very unfriendly and unwilling to help.  Additionally, she has left me on hold with no warning for 5 minutes.  Only then did I hang up and retry my call where I had to wait again several minutes to speak with someone.

Finally, when I spoke to someone they were completely unaware of what they had in stock (even though they were on the floor) and put me on hold again.  Literally, someone new kept answering the phone (4 people total which is ridiculus) as they did not have a clue what they were doing there.  I might suggest a more rigorous training and hiring process.  So whoever is doing the hiring for this store is not doing a good job at all.  Customer service would make up for the lack of product that you have in this smaller store.

I'm afraid that I feel that your staff is highly undertrained and unwilling to help someone both in store and on the phone.
