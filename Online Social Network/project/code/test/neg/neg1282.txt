I used to be a fan, but no longer.

Main issues?
1) they are overpriced.  Using mediocre bread, then charging as much as they do for sandwiches is criminal.  go to full of life, or heck, go to one of the many nice sit down places nearby, and pay only a little more. 

2) Sometimes really slow.  I recently picked up 4 sandwiches to go on a trip -- needed to get them fairly fast.  It took them THIRTY MINUTES, and the smoothies came out instantly, so they were water by the time I got the sandwiches.  Yikes.
