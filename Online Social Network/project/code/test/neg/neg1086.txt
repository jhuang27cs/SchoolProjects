Decided to try this place out during dine LA.  They had a 3 course prefix menu.  Started off with their corn chowder which was actually pretty good with a slight kick to it.  Each of us also received a piece of their zucchini bread which was also good.  After hearing good things about their Diane salad, we opted to order one of those and I ordered their smoke and fire quesadilla.  The Diane salad was eh....not very good.  I had high hopes for this salad but it was rather tasteless.  As for my quesadilla, I'd rather have one at taco bell.  The tortilla was not crispy, actually didn't even seem like it was warm.  We both opted to take home mini loaves of the zucchini bread as our desserts.  I'd go back just for their corn chowder and their zucchini bread, but nothing else.
