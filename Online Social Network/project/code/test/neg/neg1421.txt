Oh no...when this place first opened it was a godsend.  I ate there every day.  I got all my roommates/housemates and friends to eat there.

Recently, however, I got a wrap with my friend and both myself and my friend got food poisoning (he got meat, I got paneer).  

Since then I've felt the tug to eat there several times, but the memories of running to the toilet every three minutes for two days rush back before I get in the car.  It's about the least appetizing thing you can imagine.  It will be a long time before I eat there again.  I just want them to know this happened, so that they know the quality of the food they buy and cleanliness of the preparation is extremely important.  Hopefully this was just a one-time accident, otherwise they'll (sadly) be losing more customers in the future.

RIP Krazi Kebob...the love affair was good while it lasted...I feel bad giving it 1 star, but I think the sample phrase "Eek! Methinks not." describes how I feel about the place now best.  It's like I've been cheated on and now we're broken up - once you break up with someone, it takes a lot to go back to them...maybe one day...but for now...I'm moving on.
