I have been to Peet's for over years. Usually the staff are decent and friendly.

But when i went there at 5:00am on 2/23/10, a lady cashier with an unfamiliar face made me feel really unwelcomed there. I was the only customer ready to put an order at that time. When asking me what i wanted to order, she said it in an impatient tone and looked at the empty space next to her the whole time.  When asked for my name to be associated with the order, I was a bit puzzled by the contemptuous way she asked. After she swiped my credit card and handed back to me, she tore off and crumpled the receipt and walked away immediately to flirt with a young man nearby, without saying a single word. I was left standing in front of the counter wondering whether we were done with the transaction and if I had done anything wrong. I don't think that it is a good customer service to treat a customer with such discomtempt and arrogance, especially when he comes so early in the morning hoping to buy a warm coffee to get himself going for another busy day.

The coffee tasted cold that morning.
