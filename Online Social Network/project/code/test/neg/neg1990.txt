I went to this place twice while in West Lafayette for a week.  I really should have stopped after my first visit.  

The first visit was on a Saturday night.  There was a live Irish band and the place was packed.  It was very lively and our waitress was very sweet and helpful.  She made suggestions and was very prompt with our orders.  We had the goat cheese fritters, which were wonderful, the wings (average), and at the waitress's suggestion, we had the Irish Nachos.  "Irish Nachos?  WTF?" I thought to myself.  I'm from Austin, TX, where the Tex-Mex and Nachos are plentiful, and I thought that the sound of Irish food and Nachos was a recipe for disaster.  How wrong I was.  The chips are instead fried potato wedges and the combination of that with the lettuce, sour cream, and beef was delicioso!!  They also won some kind of award for the best pint of Guinness in the USA.  I don't know about that, but it was decent Guinness.

The second time I visited with a group of friends, and our new server was not friendly at all.  The place was totally dead and for us being his only customers, it says something that he wasn't very attentive.  I ordered the bread pudding, which was HORRIBLE- worst bread pudding I've ever had!  It tasted like pure rum and was disgusting.  I had two bites and left the rest, and the waiter still put it on my bill.  When I asked to speak with a manager, he removed it from the bill.  

You can get much better "craic" at another pub!
