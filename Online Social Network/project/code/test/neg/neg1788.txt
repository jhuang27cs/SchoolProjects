2 stars for the late hours and the friendly service.  Zero stars for the food.  This averages out to 1 star.

I ordered the personal, thin-crust pizza with sausage -- it was way too salty, had thick dough, and generally tasted like the stuff they serve from under a heat lamp -- maybe a little better.  I also asked for buffalo wings, and they said that they stopped making those, and offered me BBQ or teriyaki wings instead.  I decided to get the teriyaki wings, and the waiter asked me if I wanted ranch or blue cheese dressing with that.  I looked him in the eye and asked, "With teriyaki sauce?"  He got the picture and brought me those teriyaki wings without the sauce (although they still had celery on the side, which tasted weird with the teriyaki sauce).  Again, the wings were too salty -- more soy sauce, than teriyaki.

I really couldn't finish either the pizza or the wings.  Go here for the late night hours and the beer.  Don't eat the food.
