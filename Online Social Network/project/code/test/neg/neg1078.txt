I have to go with the review (Mireille M.) talking about the service.  

Don't get me wrong, the food is EXCELLENT.  And if the chef was cooking at my house, I would give him/her 4 stars.  I also think the atmosphere is cozy and enjoyable.  

But the path to being a great restaurant (and a great restauranteur) is hiring and training a smart and knowledgeable staff who can talk about the food without reading verbatim from their specials card AND know something (anything?) about the wine list.  They are the point of contact for the dining experience.  Our guy seemed nice but really couldn't answer any questions about the food, the wine, current events, basic math, anything.  

Because of the price-point relative to the service, I have to say I've experienced MUCH better in Pittsburgh.
