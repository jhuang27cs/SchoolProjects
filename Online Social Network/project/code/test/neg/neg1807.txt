2.5 smells like chai.  adulterated indian--everything all mixed in.  got the chicken tikka bowl.  yes, it's chipotle style.  the overwhelming flavor is tangy.  when everything is just poured over itself without thinking of ratios and what should mix, it doesn't work well.  at least what's nice about our country is that you can get authentic and fusion all over the bay.  variety is great, but when most people think indian, they don't want something too tomato-ey and tart.  medium was not spicy.  this sort of fusion is not as good as korean tacos.  only 3 choices: chicken, lamb, cheese.  probably shouldn't have asked for tomato and raita
