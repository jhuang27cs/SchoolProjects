I've heard SO much about Toy Joy. I was so excited to come here. Of course upon walking in you're a little overwhelmed. Not knowing where to start, I usually end up in the back and work my way to the front when in a new store. 

I was looking for something different...something peculiar, but nothing in particular! ...I was kind of disappointed. Everything was soo...cliche? Meh, it's a good spot to find your regular stuff like stuffed animals. Lots of little key chains/trinkets. Didn't leave me with the ''wow factor''. I shall keep searching for that odd/one of a kind toy store. :)
