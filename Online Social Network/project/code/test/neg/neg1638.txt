That's it; I'm done with Russell House. After two underwhelming dinners, I decided to give them one last chance, this time for brunch. Bad decision.

I ordered the American Egg Plate: 2 eggs (scrambled for me), bacon or sausage (bacon for me), home fries, and wheat toast. The home fries didn't have much flavor on their own. At least they came with ketchup on the side. A couple of the bacon strips had char marks on them. I HATE charred food. The toast was fine, except that it wasn't served with any jelly or jam. The eggs were also fine, but I like my eggs with salt and pepper, and there wasn't any on the table.

The food was served by someone other than the waiter (a runner?), who promptly left the table after serving the food, so I waited for the waiter to come by to check on us. After about 3 or 4 minutes (way too long of a wait), the waiter came by, and I asked for salt and pepper, and jam or jelly. He brought a small salt grinder, and they didn't have any small available pepper grinders, so he brought a big grinder that he took away after dispensing some pepper. That's fine, but, really??, you don't have a salt and pepper grinder for every table when you serve eggs for brunch?? Wow. And the jam that came for the toast was some kind of berry jam that had no flavor whatsoever.

The only positive thing I have to say is that the "2 eggs" looked more like 3 or 4, so you'll definitely get enough food if you order this dish. I don't think I'll be back to Russell House.
