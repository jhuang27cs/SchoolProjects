Sad. This used to be, hands down, the best Mexican fusion restaurant in the triangle. But since they fired the chef that brought them to greatness and then the owner got up and left in a flash, this place will never be the same.  I've visited once in the renovated space and new ownership, and I probably won't be back.  What was a unique chapel hill culinary landmark has been chopped up and put back together as an out of place Tex Mex sports bar.  The worst guacamole I've ever  had. Nuf said.
