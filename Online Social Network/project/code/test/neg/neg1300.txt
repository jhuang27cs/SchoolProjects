Go to this Radioshack only if you have no other choice. Find a different one if you can.

1. I was horrified at the way they treated one non-native English speaking customer who couldn't fully describe his problem quickly enough to an associate. 

2. If they do not fulfill a customer's request for service after a purchase is made, they will place the blame on another associate in the store to cover their tracks. As in "No, I think X helped you out with that last time" or "X was supposed to take care of that for you, not me." 

3. I question the ability of some (not all) of their associates to remember how to complete simple tasks. 

4. I bought a cell phone there, which was out of stock. I gave them two phone numbers to reach me at when the phone arrived, and they never called me so my new phone sat around in their store for a day. (They disabled my data access on the old phone I used until I activated the new one, so time was of the essence.) When I called them, they said that they couldn't find my phone number and that someone probably misplaced it. I saw the associate write both of them down on the receipt that they kept for the phone, which they needed to match to the device. (See #2.)

It's clear that this particular Radioshack serves not only the USC community but the local neighborhoods as well. They provide important service and products to everyone, yet the experiences I had with some (not all) associates there lead me to believe that they know they are needed in the community. Therefore, they don't feel compelled to treat everyone with the respect they deserve as paying customers.
