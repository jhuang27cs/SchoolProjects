I just left this bike store upset and offended. 

I asked the Asian man at the sales counter two questions. 1: Do you sell used bikes? He said "yes, outside." So far so good. 2: Do you take the Stanford Card Plan? "No, no funny money."

WTF? What did he mean by that? Because I'm a woman of color, I don't pay off my credit or my bills? Is he implying that Stanford deals in shady financial practices? SCP works the same as a credit card except the charges are put on your university bill. How is that so different from any other credit card which I'm sure the store accepts?

Not everyone at this school is rich or has parents who buy everything for them. Some students have to wait days for their financial aid refund to purchase necessities. Funny money? We use the card to buy textbooks! I know I don't look like the majority of students on campus. But, would he have said this to a parent or a white student? I don't think so. I was very polite when I approached him too.

It's not the first time I've experienced racism on campus, including being followed by two people at the bookstore while wearing a Stanford t-shirt.  But no matter how many times you deal with it, the hurt never goes away. I don't feel comfortable shopping here at all. I'd rather trek to SF and get better service and respect. 

I think I will inform a manager about this tomorrow when its less busy. At least I would be standing up for myself whether they take me seriously or not.
