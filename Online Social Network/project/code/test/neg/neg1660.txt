So where to begin...

I had dinner at this beautifully decorated establishment last night...well lets just say that I am on verge of calling the manager and asking for a refund as the food was atrocious!!

Great service and beautiful decor but I think they forgot to hire a chef...or anyone that knows anything about food.  

The best thing were the french fries...and yes they are french fries for which you charge $5 and cant even make the effort to perhaps serve it with an aoili sauce or something other than ketchup...and just because you call it it 'Basque Potatoes" doesn't change the fact that they are shitty french fries. 

The steak had a pattern on it which was from the pounding they gave the meat for tenderization.  Just thinking of it is grossing me out. 

Honesty I have no idea how this place is still open?!?

TO ANYONE WHO READS THIS...GO HAVE A GLASS OF WINE AT THE BAR AND ENJOY THE VIEW AND THEN GO NEXT DOOR TO ONE OF THE OTHER RESTAURANT'S OR MCDONALDS...
