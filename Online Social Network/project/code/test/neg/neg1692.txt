I'm from Chattanooga, home of the Krystal burger. These tiny grease bombs are mystery meat with grilled onions on a soft steamed bun served with pickle and mustard. 
When I received my cheesesteak from the cashier/waiter, it was missing something. I added salt...nope. Then pickle...better. Then this yummy mustard sauce...bingo. NOW it was an edible sandwich. And what did it remind me of?!? A Krystal burger...on a partially stale roll. It even gave me gas like a good ole' Krystal does!

P.S. What makes their curly fries "world famous"? They're the same damn frozen curly fries served in every other burger joint in the country. "Ore Ida don't think so!"
