Azuma to me is like a mid-scale (maybe) restaurant masquerading as something more.  I went there for HRWs, after having visited for lunch once, and felt like the food was not worth even $35 for 3 courses.  Admittedly, I did enjoy the rib dish, and the tiny, baby mouthful of bread pudding was okay.  But the chef's omakase . . . was just sashimi.  I guess I thought the chef might do something more inventive than just take fish, cut it up, put it on some ice and call it "omakase."  Maybe because I'm comparing Azuma to Uchi, but Azuma fell short, and it's why I'd rather just pick up sushi from the grocery store.

As for the waitstaff, I am so thankful that I asked the waitress to move us from behind the stairs, which is where she had originally placed us in the 1/4 full restaurant.  When I asked to move, she was not happy (she wasn't happy to start with, however), to the point that I asked her what was her problem.  (Reply: fake smile, drop the drink menu, rush off).  Thankfully, because we moved we got a nice young man who was actually happy to be there and wait on us.  If we had stayed behind the stairs with our original waitress, I'm not sure this review would have been as balanced.
