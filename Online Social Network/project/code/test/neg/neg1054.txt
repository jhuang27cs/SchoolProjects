I watched TRON here, but I did not have a good time.  I think the dilapadated seats plus the higher price, plus the acoustics made it a bad experience.  Given TRON is a loud movie b/c the soundtrack is Daft Punk, but I believe the placement of the speakers in the theater made the the sounds effects absolutely  excruciating to my ears.

I'll try to avoid this place next time I watch a movie
