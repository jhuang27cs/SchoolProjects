Maybe I went on a bad day...maybe they recycle food in the summer with less students...maybe my taste buds are off...

But the chicken was gross! Seriously... My four years here at Pitt I pass this place frequently. As a lover of Rotisserie Chicken, I figured maybe this is a mistake...how have I not made my way in here at least once???

-___- I guess I found out why. I dont know what it is about this seasoning, but its the least bit good in my opinion. It smelled good...the chicken looks semi appealing (mmmm moist..look at dat skinnn!) but in reality its just something off about it. Over-seasoned with non tasty seasonings..that sums it up.

I got the 1/4 chicken and rice and beans. Like another poster said, the beans saved it..but nothing to write home about. The rice is decent too. I actually ate all the rice and beans...nibbled on some chicken...might save it for Shuffles (jk..that would be an insult even for him!)

All in all, for 7-something this was not my "just got paid, let me eat out for a change" treat that I was looking for. Boston Market on Center would have given me Rotisserie and some healthy sides. Oh yeah...and the portions were small...and Im a small chick so.....that should say something.

Do yourself a favor...grab something off of Atwood or Oakland ave...
