I made an appointment on the website the day of my event.
They called me to CANCEL my appointment literally TWO HOURS before it was meant to happen... Apparently the stylist who was supposed to do my appointment was going home early that day.

They offered me no alternatives, vaguely suggesting I either "try again tomorrow" or "call the menlo park location"... because it makes sense for me to get my hair done THE DAY AFTER my event?

Thanks for nothing, Halo. 

Would never, ever recommend it to a friend.
