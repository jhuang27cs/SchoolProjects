The husband and I dashed in here one night because we didn't want to go to one of the chain places all over Westwood that cater to the college students.  The decor is amazing - it really is beautiful and romantic.  But the food and service is spotty.  I had the fish of the day, which was grilled nicely but the flavor was nothing special.  My husband had a steak that he ordered medium, and literally half the steak was medium and the other half was well done and dry.  The red wine we drank was warm and mediocre.  And it took quite a while before our waiter would come back and take our credit card so that we could pay the bill. This was actually funny considering how badly they wanted people out of there by ten.  There were a few other people in the restaurant we they pulled the tacky "let's turn up all the lights" number to rush everyone out.  I won't be back.
