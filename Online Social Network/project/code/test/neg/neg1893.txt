Here is my email I sent to the corporate office. I have had 3 bad experiences in the past few months at the Harvard sq location.

Dear Finagle,

I have been a loyal customer since you opened your first store.  After a 6 year stay on the west coast I have just moved back to Cambridge ma and I have been getting My bagels at your Harvard sq location on Mass Ave. 

Today was my 3rd and final trip to your stores as once again I was given a hard, at least 1 day probably more day old bagel & it had a bad Taste. This has happened two other times once an entire dozen were no good. 

I know you have become a large corporation now but you need to do something about this. In these tough economic times your really should try and please your customers and you should keep an eye on your franchise stores that are serving no good bagels to save a buck. What happen to the soft, fresh, still warm from the oven bagels you guys made multiple times a day? 

The bad news is I am a Yelper and I am going to post this on yelp. If you respond I will be more than happy to post that as well but you really need to get your act together with so many amazing locally owned bakeries in Cambridge I think you may have trouble competing with hard day old bagels.
