If it wasn't nearly across the street from campus and open late at night King Pin wouldn't be nearly as popular. Their doughnuts have always been mediocre at best, and mysteriously are never hot out of the oven at any time of day. 

You want a real doughnut served hot? Go to Rolling Pin in San Bruno around 10:45 p.m. or Donut Wheel in Cupertino (different varieties of hot doughnuts come out of the oven all night).
