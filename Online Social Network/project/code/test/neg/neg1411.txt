I ordered food from here today for dinner. I got two lamb gyro platters- one for me, one for my boyfriend. 

Allow me to add that I am not that difficult to please. I like to give raving reviews to restaurants that deserve it, especially small businesses.

The food showed up at my door after an hour and a half, with four slabs of cold meat. The salad was drenched in dressing. The hummus was as runny as an over easy egg and didn't taste like any variety of chickpeas I've ever had.

The pita was clearly bought at the acme down the street, not the least bit toasted or browned.

Do not order from here. Unless you like runny egg hummus.

I am hungry.
