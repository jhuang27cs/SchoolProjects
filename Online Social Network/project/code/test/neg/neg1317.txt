I ordered a vegetarian pizza and received one with pepperoni. I simply asked them to remake pizza. Instead Puccini's removed the pepperoni's and added new cheese and reheated the old pizza. So, I received a pizza that had burnt edges and undercooked cheese. The manager didn't even come by to apologize, terrible service.
