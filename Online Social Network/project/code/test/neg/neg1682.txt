I apologize in advance for offending anyone by not being wowed at Vortex.  I totally hoped to be.  We decided it was time for a good burger, so we ventured into town.  The nachos appetizer was good, but standard, nothing unusual.  The burger was big and not bad, but also, just a burger.  The fries were also standard.  My husband's wings - also (you guessed it) standard.  For dealing with the parking in town (street or pay lot) and the wait, I expected something awesome, and I got the same thing I could have had at Taco Mac or most other decent bars.  It wasn't bad by any means, and the setting is unique, but I don't see much reason for returning, unfortunately.
