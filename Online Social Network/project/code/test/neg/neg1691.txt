Uh. . .yeah. "Restaurant." Sure, if you want to relieve the worst American-Chinese of your youth (if you grew up in the U.S.), or someone else's youth (if you did not).

If they can't deep fry it, or cover it in soy sauce or the ever-mysterious "brown sauce" then it's not on the menu.

As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a place for kids to get hammered and get non-laid. That's it. But sometimes the comedy shows are o.k.
