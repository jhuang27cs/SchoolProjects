Do you like management that does not do anything? THEN YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE!

I was subletting from somebody for the summer as I had an internship in Hollywood. All of the utilities sounded nice, the original lease holder and I had cut a deal that sounded reasonable.

The first day I move in, they made me sign a lot of paperwork that they never mentioned needed to be filled out to me or the person I was leasing from. Thus, I had to wait several hours to get this paperwork faxed to the places it needed to. Frustrating and stupid.

My biggest grievance is how LITTLE they will actually do if you raise a complaint. Within several weeks of moving in to my apartment, I started to get small clustered bites: bed bugs.

I went down to ask them to spray and check for bed bugs. For two weeks, I heard nothing as the problem got worse and worse. I returned to them to which they said they had sent somebody and they had found nothing so they did not do anything about them.

At this point, I had already discovered that several apartments had had a bed bug infestation just a month or so before I moved in. Clearly these people had no idea what they were doing. I ended up having to take care of it myself and they would not reimburse me for my costs.

The amount of sleep they caused me and the pure sanitation nightmare that is Jefferson Court on Midvale is horrible. I 100% recommend finding any other place.
