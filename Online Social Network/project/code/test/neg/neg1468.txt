Unlike the previous reviewer we did get served - but maybe only cause I was pushy :)

I ordered lobster bisque and my husband had french onion and a chicken wrap.  My lobster bisque was yummy, had real lobster in it and was nice and hot.  That said it was probably a bit overpriced even for the real lobster.  My husband was not impressed with either of his options and when I tasted his soup it was not appealing at all :(

Overall, it was an okay lunch, but not one we need to repeat - I think I can get better prices and soup at Panera and it's right around the corner.
