The atmosphere was nice.... the location is great... the parking sucks (pay lot or metered parking).

The hookah is bland, the service was mediocre... Originally, I was going to give this place 3 stars, but things just got worse and worse.

2 hookahs and a water = $50!!!!! NO REFILLS 

For something so 'meh' that was irritating... what bothered me the most is THEY INCLUDE GRATUITY TO YOUR BILL EVEN IF YOU'RE IN A SMALL GROUP OF 3 PEOPLE AND THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT. I think that's just God awful because you shouldn't have to tip people for terrible service.

I don't appreciate shady people or shady business practices. 

NEVER again.
