"The little restaurant that couldn't" 

A bit disappointed after having a late lunch here. The food is above average, but not great. It seems this place aims high, but fails. Examples: The "Wolfgang pizza". The toppings are very good, but the dough is moist, soft, and not crispy. Too bad. The gnocchi do not look home-made, and the pumpkin sauce has an industrial feeling to it. Their famous "dragon" noodles: The noodles were overcooked, soft and mushy. 
Their espresso was, frankly, undrinkable. 

Service is very good, but being charged 20% for a party of 7 for lunch takes away one star.
