Wow.  These guys are still open?

I love cheesesteak sandwiches, and Texadelphia has, without a doubt, the worst I've ever had.  I've tried three locations, and they're uniformly dreadful.  The meat has little flavor, the bread is too soft and soggy.

If you like cheesesteaks, keep going.  Nothin' to see here, folks.
