I tried this little restaurant based on the reviews here at Yelp.  I was disappointed with the food and, with the current high rating, I feel obligated to voice my opinion.

As others mentioned, for $17, you get a plain (and mediocre) salad and pasta of the day with 4 different sauces.  I, along with 3 others in my group, tried all 4 sauces.  We feel that supermarket jars of sauce from Ragu taste better than these.  The sauces were bland.  Even the arrabiata ("angry") was mild.

The appetizer of the day, which was beans with mozarella cheese and tomatoes, was better but not excellent.  Likewise, the tiramisu and berry tart were pretty good, but not among the best we've tried.  The appetizer and dessert are extra cost, and inflated our bill to about $60 for two.

If you want good Italian food in Claremont, I suggest Tutti Mangia or Aruffo's, both of which have more flavorful sauces.  If you're on a strict bland diet, then La Picoletta might be for you.
