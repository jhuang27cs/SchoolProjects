This place is just overpriced. Annoying that they only take cash, too. I mean, if you're a cash only place, you'd better have an irresistible SOMETHING going on in there. Most places that have hookahs only charge about $10 for it. This place approaches $20. Lame. I'm not a shisha connoisseur by any means but I know it wasn't worth $18. Also, we kept having to ask them to fix the coals because they did not place them properly. Cool atmosphere, that's about it.
