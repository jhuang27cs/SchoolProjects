This place has a very cool atmosphere but I didn't think the burgers were that amazing.  I've definitely had better burgers (try in-n-out).  I came here the first time because of the beer and burger pairing.  Sad to say, I was kinda disappointed.  I didn't think the beers paired well with the burgers.  The burgers with goat cheese and blue cheese was extremely overwhelming.  It took over the entire burger.  I would rather get a burger from Father's Office of In-n-Out.
