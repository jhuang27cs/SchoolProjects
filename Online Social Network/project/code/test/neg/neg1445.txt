I freaking love stuffed things. All kinds of stuffed things: dumplings, ravioli, empanadas, pierogies, whatever. My ideal restaurant would be a veritable United Nations of stuffed things.

So I was excited to see a dumpling restaurant in my neighborhood. Unfortunately, though, the dumplings just aren't that great. Not terrible, but not great. 

I tried the chicken and green pepper dumplings (pan fried), the chicken, basil, and shiitake mushroom dumplings (steamed), the vegetable dumplings (pan fried), and the scallion and egg pancakes. 

Everything was really mediocre. The chicken inside the dumplings was too pastey and uniform for my taste, and the scallion pancakes were way, way too greasy. My favorite dumplings were the vegetable ones, which had identifiable veggies inside, and I was impressed that the fried food stayed fairly crispy despite the delivery process. Overall, though, I was really underwhelmed.

The total bill came out to $27, which I thought was crazily expensive for the quality of food we got.

Apparently a lot of people really like this place, so give it shot if you're in the area and craving dumplings. Personally, though, they just weren't my style. I doubt I'll order from here again anytime soon.

(By the way: if you're getting delivery, definitely ask them to include the spicy chili oil. It costs 50 cents extra, but it makes a world of difference.)
