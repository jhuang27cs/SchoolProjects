We were excited to try this place out, as we missed Korean food.  My stomach hurts now, not in a good way.

We were immediately seated, and they opened our bottle of wine (we should have brought beer or Soju).

I thought of ordering at least some white tuna (not on regular menu, but in specials), but then decided on a Korean-only spread.  Kimchee, pancakes, and bulgogi.

The kimchee was excellent, and we were sad when they took the sauce away, as it would have been nice with our next appetizer.

The pancakes (vegetable)--too doughy and greasy.  And likely the culprit for my tummy ache.  Nice sauce, although it was a little too sweet.

Bulgogi (beef)--a tad salty, but good flavour.  Came with more kimchee (yeah!). We asked for some lettuce, and then were told that this was NOT a Korean place.  Um, okay?  Then they left.  We would have paid for some extra lettuce, as it is traditional to roll the bulgogi in lettuce and dip it into a sweet and tangy fish sauce.  But this was not a Korean place, apparently.

The comment, and lack of lettuce, kind of put us off.  The food was good, and the rice cooked perfectly, but no lettuce to offset the sweetness and grease.  

$37 including tax and tip for 2 of us.  It might be a 3 because we loved the kimchee, and the flavours were good, but no lettuce was wierd.  They left before we could even ask for lettuce or a salad or something.  Even Taco Bell would give you lettuce if you asked for it.

We so miss the restaurant Kimchee in Bay Ridge/Brooklyn.  Now we have another reason to either visit our old 'hood or set up our new cast iron hibachi.
