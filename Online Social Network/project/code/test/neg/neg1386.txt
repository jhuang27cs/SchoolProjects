This is one of the worst sushi places I have ever been to, hands down.
The service is terrible (the waitstaff acts like you should be grateful they even remembered your table) and the food is basic and unmemorable. It's not very clean; I've been here a few times and the tables are always sticky or there is trash surreptitiously hidden next to the shoyu bottle. If you order any of the meat (like the bulgogi for example) expect the same as if you'd ordered at Gushi because they seem to share the same kitchen.
There are 3 other sushi places in Westwood I can think of off the top of my head and I would rather go to any of them than this place.
