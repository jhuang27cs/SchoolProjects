Alright, so I moved a bit up the street from this place a few years ago, and immediately was excited because it looked like one of those great, divey, Mexican restaurants. The first time I went there, I ordered something I hadn't tried before, because I wanted to be adventurous. I should say, at this point, that I grew up on the west coast, so I know what good Mexican should taste like, and I knew that a place like this would probably be my best bet. Well anyway, the food was not good. I still wanted to believe, though! I've been to this place probably 5-6 times over the years, every time thinking "this can't be as bad as I remembered it". It is. So this morning, I got a hankering for huevos rancheros, and since they are still the most authentic place that delivers to my house, I decided to go for it again. Big mistake. Over an hour later, I had a fairly soggy bunch of huevos. Clearly I should have gone with the egg and cheese bagel instead.

What's wrong? Well, nothing really has much flavor--it's all kind of bland. If you do feel like you need to go for one of their enormous burritos, you won't finish it and you'll feel horrible from eating all those carbs. There might be a little meat too, but you won't taste it. Even their guacamole doesn't taste good--I don't know how, but they've managed flavorless guacamole. Now I know that I probably had it coming with the breakfast I ordered today--not a big surprise that it would be a bit soggy after delivery. Still, it was pretty disappointing. I was also forced to get a carnitas taco to push it up to $10 (why are their tacos $3?) . Again, flavorless, and I didn't notice much of the green sauce I selected.

Do yourself a favor and look up La Aguila on either 103rd or 116th and Lexington. SO MUCH BETTER. Unfortunately I'm a bit out of their delivery range.
