The pizza is super greasy, but quite inexpensive.  I've grabbed a quick slice here while visiting the Cal campus on several occasions including this afternoon.  Take your pizza to go because the counters and tables (rarely available) are usually pretty filthy.  With the amount of foot traffic here it seems they've just given up on cleaning after patrons during daytime hours.  It's probably a lot cooler to stand outside and people-watch on Telegraph Avenue anyways.  I'd give them a solid 2.5 stars.
