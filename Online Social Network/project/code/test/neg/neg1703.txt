I was attracted by the menu.  

We had teryaki chicken and chicken lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were rediculously small...Im talking 3 very small slices of chicken on the plate with 2 spoonfuls of edamae/carrot slaw for $8.  The chicken was also seriously lacking in flavor, basically pan saute with some salt.  The teryaki chicken was tastey but again the portion was smaller than I was expecting for the price.

Over, Ive experienced better.  There wasnt anything memorable about the food and the prices were too high.
