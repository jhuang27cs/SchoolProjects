blech, i don't like bertucci's pizza at all.  they don't use enough cheese, the sauce is meagerly spread and too salty, and the crust is not at all stand-out.  however, the buns they serve are always hot (actually sometimes so hot you really have to be careful!), and if you're out with a group it's an easy place to settle on b/c it's not *bad* per se.
