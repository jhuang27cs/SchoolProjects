I went to go type this in to the Yelp search bar and "Cinder Blocks" appeared first. Which is what I'd rather be eating, and also what the delivery man should be hit in the head with..!
I ordered a salad and some steamed veggies. The salad is nothing but iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumbers. I wasn't expecting anything special (BECAUSE IT'S A SALAD) but maybe some romaine? No? 
Anyways...
The veggies. The smelled like a bag of asses and clearly were not fresh. Sadly, it would have been cheaper, YES CHEAPER to just get the stuff from Whole Foods GRGGGGGG! 
Lastly, with the most clear, concise, easy to follow directions that was sent along with the online order, the delivery driver called from inside his car, got the directions again although he was right in front of the building, went to the wrong building, and got angry at me. Unbelievable. I don't mind if you get lost, but don't take the 'tude.
