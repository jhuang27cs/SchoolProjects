Ew.

I was sitting there reading quietly downstairs towards the front of the cafe, when all of a sudden at the corner of my eye, I see something move. I thought maybe it was just me hallucinating but when I did a double-take, it was a MOUSE!

I immediately hopped out of my chair along with my belongings and left this place for good. This place is obviously a dirty shithole.

I'm sure they're not the only place around Berkeley infested with mice, but come on now, if you have mice lurking around there, imagine what lurks in your food! 

Gross.
