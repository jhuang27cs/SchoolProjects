I wish I had more to say about this place but beyond crappy service and crappier food, I can't say much. I had their Singapore Curry noodles and they hurt my stomach for the next 12 hours. The service was so bad - servers were very slow and rude when we asked for more water. 

Bottomline: given that this place is in NYC, I don't understand how they're still operating but save your $$ and spend them at any other restaurant.
