I was given a week-end get away from work because, of some of the long hours that I spent on a project. So we left early Friday am to drive to Atlanta had I known what was about to happen I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WEE-END AWAY. First we check in beside The Varsity a Landmark Drug dealers hangout. 
     We start putting clothes in the closet and I see a pair of dirty underwear YUK!!!!  I call the manager on duty he sends a house keeper and her supervisor and she proceeds to  scream at her for 15 minutes in front of us till she started crying. I called down and told them I WANT AWAY FROM THIS LUNATIC .Then they moved us to another room  everything seemed ok we went to dinner and drinks downstairs .
      While we where down there they asked if we wanted to charge the room I said sure it would be easier that way. We got back at the room I guess about midnight we where tired so we pulled back the blankets and I saw BOOGERS on the HEAD BOARD UNBELIEVABLE . .I CALLED AGAIN AND TOLD THEM I WANTED ANOTHER ROOM AND I WANTED IT CHECKED BEFORE WE WALKED IN. SO we got dressed its about 2am 2 bellman came up they checked the room and helped us pack and unpack AGAIN. OK SO NOW ITS ABOUT 3  . The phone rings its the restaurant first then  the bar . They said because, I moved I would have to come down and sign the ticket that charges another room. I told them they where out of their mind to call the front desk so now at almost 4am the front desk calls and says that I would have to come down so they could close out the 2 places I TOLD THEM THEY ARE F.... CRAZY .I took the phone off the hook At about noon of that day we packed up and left. I told them to take the money that my company had already paid for another night and pay the bills ..
           THE NIGHT FROM HELL!!!!!!!!!
