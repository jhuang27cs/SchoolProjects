I was here representing a client for an award show gifting suite. One would think that the hotel would be more accommodating because of the free PR it would be getting, with the celebs that would be attending-think again.

The hotel staff was most unaccommodating when asked for a dolly which we could use to transport products to the gifting suite. I was told numerous times by many staff that they did not have such a thing for us to use, when I saw plenty lying around.

After the event, a couple of friends and I went to The Backyard to have some drinks. Service was slow. After we were given our menus, the server disappeared for 20 minutes before returning to take our order. After our order, there was another 10-15 minutes of waiting before we got our drinks. Drink prices here are not out of the ordinary of what you would expect from a place like this in LA.

Valet here is expensive. Probably one of the most expensive I have paid for in LA. Not to mention it's also very slow. I had to wait for 30 minutes before I got to the window to pay. It's $10 for the first hour and then $7 (or something ridiculous like that) for every hour there after. I would suggest just metering it.
