I had the Groupon mani pedi here. Never had a haircut.

Ron, who is an owner, is socially awkward, and my pedicure experience was strange. There are no spa chairs. He bought out a footbath like the kind you would buy at Bed Bath Beyond, and I sat in a regular chair with my feet soaking. Imagine you wanted to do a pedicure at your house - you'd buy one of these foot-soakers. Only, wait, you've paid for a pedicure at a salon - so you expect something with more ambiance, something more professional... Well, this was more of a DIY experience. The pedicure itself was sub-standard. Nail polish was was sloppy, no cuticles were removed, etc. 

The female co-owner does the manicure. It was what you would call an express mani, I believe. She didn't even soak my hands - just filed my nails and painted them. It felt incomplete, weird. Again, not professional, and not worth even the Groupon price.

I wouldn't go back at any price, not even for free. It was a waste of time, and I had another mani pedi done a week later at another salon.
