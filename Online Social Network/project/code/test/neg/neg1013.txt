Meh....I've had better.

Chicky Pub is where it's at.  This seems to be a the more expensive, more greasy, less chicken, less yummy....you get my point.  I miss the Ave..there used to be a lot of good food memories along the ave.  Wingdome for one is something I miss.  The cheap wing days were drunken nights of gluttony and regret that was never to be repeated only to be reborn again like the phoenix from the ashes the very next week.

This place is more like the legion of pigeons that roam the streets (aka chicky pub competitors) that pale in comparison to the golden fried goodness that is true KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).

Oh well...I had hoped...now if only there was a chicky pub closer...or even a wing dome.....
