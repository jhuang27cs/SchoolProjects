I'm gonna have to go ahead and say this place made me feel like i was in middle school.  I thought about doing the all you can eat sushi with some friends but for the price they had it for, it didn't seem worth it.

Also there's like a million rules and regulations for the all you can eat.  Once we decided that it wasn't worth it for the all you can eat we ordered our rolls. Once they came i was kinda surprised, the size of the roll was pretty small.  

Then when we started eating the rolls the rice tasted kinda off and the rolls actually started to fall apart.  I came here out of a recommendation by my gf saying that she had lunch here and it was pretty good.

I'm not sure if it was just and off day but it made me not want to come back here. The rolls themselves were ok when they didn't fall apart but there was no stand out part of the meal.  

I also don't like it when there's a million rules to ordering a certain meal i mean really? Do i need to sign a waiver too in case you kill me?
