I was super excited when I heard about this place from my baking friend.  So I thought, "Hey, if she's excited, it must be a good cupcake".  So as we line up for a tasty creation, I expected sweet baked air wafting my way, but I didn't.  I expected the wait to be long because of the hype.  I actually think it's cool that they have a cult following and that they give out free cupcakes during a random hour everyday with a secret password.  However, I didn't think the price or the hype is justified after eating their cupcakes.  

I ordered the infamous red velvet cupcake and the milk chocolate cupcake.  The red velvet was dry and was over-frosted (I like cupcakes to taste like cake, not frosting).  I was mega disappointed because I expected a rich and moist cake, not a cake that is masked by the taste of frosting.  Later that day, I took a bite out of the milk chocolate one (which was still dry) and was still disappointed.  I just gave it to my brother since I couldn't stand to throw away such an expensive cupcake.  

Sorry to all the fans.  Maybe I'm just too picky.  I'll bake my own cupcakes next time.  Kudos to sprinkles for using biodegradable forks and knives.
