This place could be so much better with so little effort...  Like all Mongolian BBQs this place has fresh meat and veggies and sauce that you apply on your own.  The ingredients generally are full and fresh...  My only complaints about the ingredients are that the meat is often frozen together and cilantro only makes an appearance about 50% of the time.

In large part, my gripe with this place is with the cooks...they have NO pride in their work, I think they enjoy cleaning off the grill far more than actually cooking.  That's a good thing because they clean the grill after just about every customer.  The reason they clean the grill after every customer is that their typical method of cooking is just flattening out the veggies and noodles into a pancake and letting it sit for a few minutes.  Yes, this does cook the food, but it also burns the crap out of it on side, leaving a big pile of burnt on noodles they need to clean off.  If they turned the grillables just a few times they would be evenly cooked and taste oh so much better.   Also if things were in more of a pile, then maybe the sauces I just painstakingly applied to my food would actually adhere to the food instead of evaporating off instantly.

All that said...I still come here every few weeks...Papa loves Mongolian barbecue and this place is walking distance from the office.
