Normally, I wouldn't waste a keystroke or a sentence on a place like Z Square, but I happened to be browsing restaurant listings in the Cambridge area, and noticed that Z Square received not one but several five star ratings, apparently posted by relatives of its owners /  people who have never been to a restaurant / or (at the least) people who did not go to Z Star for lunch.  

Like Jenny N., Z Square made me "feel like I am in NYC," which is normally a plus, but the warm feeling faded as soon as they gave me one of those electronic buzzer things to inform me when my food was ready.  This was lunch, mind you.  You can stow the buzzer and just holler across the counter--I will keep my ears open. 

Then the food came.  Our meal was, to put it charitably, disappointing.  I had the egg salad, which involved some hard boiled eggs that had been casually stirred with a hint of mayo and NO SALT. Screwing up egg salad requires talent.

My coworker had some nouveau take on a grilled cheese which was neither grilled nor particularly cheesy, and looked pitiful.  Again, to state the obvious, messing up a grilled cheese is a culinary anti-feat. 

Finally, they served some kind of apple slaw along with the sandwiches.  OK, I thought, I dig on apples, I dig on slaw.  But instead of putting it in a little ramekin (aka, a side dish, which even KFC would do) they just plopped it on the plate, where its apple slaw juices soggified my already lame-o egg salad sandwich, taking it into the realm of the inedible.

Suffice it to say, I have not returned.   Z Square needs to learn its food ABCs before it tries to bring that highfalutin E. Village stees up into Cambridge.
