Horrible Customer service.
Yeah..I know it's a college campus but who keeps students waiting for 20-25 min for a single garlic naan. yeah..I know it's fresh but when you see all the other normal naan come out 15 min before...you know something is wrong.

My garlic naan has nasty canned garlic and was completely forgettable.

I asked for one of those little containery things she was serving the naan in because the foil was too hot and she said said "no, you asked to go." Um...I wasn't aware that disposable french fries containers were so expensive that you couldn't afford to give me one after waiting 20 min...

Their tikka marsala is really just watered down sauce and little tiny shreds of chicken. Gross. You gonna pay $7 bucks for it? That's fine by me. I'd much rather head over to santorini's, tap ex or even burger king and get a better bang for my buck.

So during my 20 min wait I was snacking on the salad, which is eh..ok. I get tired of eating out of their little itsy bitsy condiment containers and just grab a water cub. At the end, she tells me that next time she'll charge me. Fat chance fat lady. 

I'm not coming back.
