Pappy's clean up Blake's real nicely, but both are the one and the same to me still. This meaning, overpriced food and drinks in a large decent space. This is one of those places that would only be enjoyable if there was a crowd and if you're into hanging out with undergrad college students. Come here for all your major sporting events. The food is good, but on the pricey side for what it is. The burgers can be ordered with a soda or beer combo deal. The fries are thickly cut and the condiments are infinite. The burger was delicious, though skimpy on the pickle slices. Beers are $5/pint and $15/pitcher as long as it's not Bud Light. That said, the selection is mediocre. Of the usual, the notables being the usual Sierra Nevada IPA, Racer 5 IPA, Widmer Hef, Shocktop White. The service is pretty good, definitely well-staffed with people with good attitudes. The downstairs area has lots of room, dart board, and pool tables. There's also a patio. There's a cool digital jukebox there, but I can't say the same about the tunes.
