I first ate here when it was in the smaller location across the street.  At the time I thought the sandwiches were good - as were the crepes - the menu list of which was painted on the wall in the original location.  Since Sava's moved I have eaten there 3 additional times and unfortunately every time have had extremely poor service - requests made repeatedly for refills or a condiment and never done, messed up orders, flustered and stressed out behavior.  Each time I have visited I have asked for a list of the crepes and have always been met by confusion at this request - I'm assured they have "many kinds" but no one can produce a list.  Sadly my book group tried the place during restaurant week (without me) and reported they had "astonishingly bad service" -- I'm not sure if it's a couple rotten servers or what but clearly there's an issue.
