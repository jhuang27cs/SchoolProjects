The wings were avg to slightly above avg.  The blue cheese was pretty good.  

Good selection of beer for a dive bar.

I did notice a reasonable trickle of desperate looking average girls walking into this bar.   If you haven't showered and wearing old clothes that day and still want to get lucky with an average girl, this is the place for you.  You'd probably do better randomly hitting on girls on the street though.

If you never go to The Ruck, you aren't missing much.
