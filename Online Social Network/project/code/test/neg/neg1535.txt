I tried to make a reservation 4 days ago and was never contacted. The email address provided on the website was undeliverable. I tried again today and left a message and still no return call.  Technically, I wouldn't even rate this place because I didn't get to go there.  Not sure if this place is even open and if it is, how it stays in business if it doesn't answer or return calls.  I have a friend visiting this weekend, and our tradition is going to tea.  I'm annoyed because it's a little late to get a reservation at another place.
