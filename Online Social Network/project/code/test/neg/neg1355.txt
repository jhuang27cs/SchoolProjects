Disappoting to say the least.. "nice italian dinner" its not. The pasta dish was tasteless and rich. That's not a good combination.. and the salad at quiznos is better. Since the price is in between an olive garden and fancy place like la bruscetha or tanino, you might as well pay up for something nicer, or be content w/ olive garden.

Two stars for friendly service and nice atmosphere.
