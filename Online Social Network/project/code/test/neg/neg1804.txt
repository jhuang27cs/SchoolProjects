great idea. poor execution.

think chipotle + pizzeria mozza. sounds like it could be awesome. waiting in line for 40 minutes was fine. seeing all the ingredients and the magic of the pizza being hand made in front of me was awesome. the end product?

NOT better than Pizzeria Mozza. Seriously? how are you going to compare?!? The ingredients here are good, but the pizzas don't come together nicely. Too watery, dough is burnt and not evenly cooked 

ORDERED: burrata (cherry tomatoes, pesto, and arugula), Tartufo AND Pizza Margherita with ricotta (they only roll it into one side),

I was a little hungry so I ordered two of these bad boys. I got the Pizza Margherita with the ricotta rolled in. But otherwise I wanted it plain. When you have a pizza plain is when you can taste the real flavors. ESPECIALLY with Neapolitan pizza. When you  use that word "Neapolitan" you are saying this pizza goes back to its Italian roots. Needless to say, I was excited. I've had Pizza in Naples (birthplace of the Italian pizza).

GOOD: The burrata (alas I'm a burrata fiend), the ingredients (very very fresh)
BAD: The dough (good flavor, bad execution), how it is cooked, and outcome.
TIPS: don't get too much on your pizza. It will make it more soggy.

I really hope they fix this. My friend Jerry said "burrata was the best thing tonight" Mina "not sure if I can come back when I lift my pizza and everything literally falls off".

Their pizzas has way more toppings than mine, so their experience may have been worse.
