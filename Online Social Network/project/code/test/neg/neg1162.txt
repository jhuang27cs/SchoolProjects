Despite the really strange decor and uptight asian waitresses, this place isn't too bad for their happy hour. I was happy with the White Dragon Roll, the fish was fresh and not chewy. Try their Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice too, it's a new and interesting dish, I like the contrast of textures on this one.
