The storefront window makes you think it's a lousy lingerie/porn shop. Inside it's floor-to-ceiling overcrowded and smells like old clothes. It seems like the owner scavenges estate sales and thus all the clothes once belonged to old ladies (and worn when they were old ladies). Maybe she's just selling off her mother/grandmother's clothes, I dunno. Also, any decent pair of shoes cost at least $40 which seemed very overpriced for what you get (but maybe I'm not in-the-know about the high end labels from eras gone by).

I think the stairs had leopard print carpet. Just FYI.

Another issue - she has a big dog. Now, I love stores with nice dogs or cats in them! But this place was too crowded and this gigantic puppy (yes, she said again and again "he's just a puppy!") was too much. So, she hit my pet peeve about bad dog owners and the whole place was cluttered and tacky!

I agree with the other reviewer on the bag sign and video cameras. Honestly, I just don't think her inventory is worth stealing from!
