Awful.  I visited this location the day before Thanksgiving.  It was not pretty.  The chicken is dry, the service is terrible, and... worst of all, I found out that they donated $2M to Anti-Gay Groups in 2009 like the AFA.  They have also have given money to groups that think you can "pray away the gay". Do you really want to support that kind of crap?

For me, it's not just about the food, it's about the morals of a business.  And the morals of Chik-fil-A suck!  

The service was slow as well.  Since the food is yucky, it won't be hard for me to stay away.
