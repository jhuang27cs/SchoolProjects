Are you kidding me? Their food is so over-commercialized (for a one-shop type of restaurant).  It's like someone walked in to restaurant depot, picked up hot dogs/sausages, hawaiian bread buns, and said...this costs me a buck twenty-five each (cost), let me quintuple the price, and sell it to PCC students who think they're getting quality food (vs. jack in the box, carl's, mcdonald's, burger king).  For a dollar-fifty you can get a an all beef hot dog, delicious bun, and toppings at Costco (oh! and that includes a drink!).  Sure, that is commercialized also, but it's only a buck-fifty!

The food is good.  But it's certainly NOT special.  It doesn't justify the decor OR the hype.  If you are in the neighborhood and want a bite, I suggest you go to Lee's Hoagies.  Have the chicken hoagie.  It's healthier, tastes far more fresh, and less commercialized and processed...despite the similarity in price or speed.
