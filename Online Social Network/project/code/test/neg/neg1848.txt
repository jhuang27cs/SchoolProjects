The coffee I've had here is decent. Four stars.

Seating is impossible here as others have said. Even the outdoor patio seating is at capacity early on Sunday mornings. Docked 1 star, it is something that is under their control.

EXCESSIVE WAIT TIMES for the iced beverages. Apparently only one person is qualified to make these drinks and just toddles from the back room now and then to make the drinks. It took them a full 15 minutes to make an iced coffee with whip cream for me last Sunday and that is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Docked 1 star.

That leaves us with 2 stars. If it wasn't so close to UCSD I probably wouldn't be coming back any time soon.
