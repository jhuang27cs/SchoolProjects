I stayed at the Hyatt Place about 2 weeks ago.  It was a BAD check-in experience.

We arrived at the hotel about 10:30pm on a weekend.  There was a clerk at the front desk, but he could not check us in.  Only the "check in" person can do that.  We asked where the check-in person was.  He was giving a tour of the hotel.  We waited.  We waited.  We waited.  About 20 minutes later, he finally returned to the front desk.  He offered a reluctant apology that quickly turned to attitude when we complained and asked his opinion of whether this customer service comported with Hyatt.  He had nothing to say.

I've stayed at numerous Hyatt hotels across the United States and have never experienced service like this.  Never.

Rude.  Unhelpful.  Nasty.

SUMMARY:  There are more welcoming hotels nearby.
