I had a similar experience. API purchased my building from my landlord a couple of months into my lease. The squirrels in the walls and closets were a major issue which took months for API to correct. Initial calls elicited almost zero action from API. Eventually, numerous letters prompted some action, albeit insufficient, from them but the squirrels continued to co-inhabit our residence. The rodents managed to enter my closet and damage my personal property. API eventually paid for the destruction of property and eradicated the squirrels but it took legal action on my part to get API to take the required strides to make the residence tolerable and eliminate the problem. 

Anyway, even for smaller issues such as a door coming off it's hinges API takes quite a while to respond to maintenance requests and does not really seem to care about the problems their tenants encounter in their properties. I would avoid this company at all costs. They try to present themselves as a reputable property management and apartment rental company but they seemed grossly incompetent and ill-equipped in all my dealings with them. 

Good luck if you do happen to end up renting from them. This should be easy to avoid as there are plenty other properties in University City.
