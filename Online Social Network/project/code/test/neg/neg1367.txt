Irish pubs such as the Asgard don't really do it for me, probably because I have spent so much time in Ireland and prefer the real deal when it comes to the pub scene. And Asgard is not the real deal. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the servers are mostly ok, but the food seems rather average and the place just feels a bit too generic to me. For a fun night at an authentic Irish pub, I guess I'd rather hit a place such as James's Gate in Jamaica Plain, The Druid in Inman Square, or O'leary's in Brookline.
