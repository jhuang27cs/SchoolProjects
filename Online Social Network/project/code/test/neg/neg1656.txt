I have to agreed with Kristine D. about the sing-along program at this particular Pottery Barn Kids.  I went a few weeks ago and it was also Andy Z performing.  The place was just way too crowded.  The store did not seem to really set up very well for this kind of event.  It was so crowded that it was too hard to concentrate and enjoy his program.  The store clerk told me that it's only this crowded for Andy Z.  They should anticipate this and somehow set up the store differently maybe.
