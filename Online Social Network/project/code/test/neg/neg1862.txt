I wandered in here by chance one night.

I sit down and they give me a menu.  No water.  No bread.  I look around for a waiter so I can see what reds they have by the glass.  And I look.  And I look.  The place was pretty much empty, so it wasn't that people were busy.  I spot a busboy or someone, who brings me water, and ask what wines they have by the glass - he goes to get a waiter.  More waiting.

Finally a waiter.  I get a glass of Chianti.  Not bad.

I had the fried calamari and spaghetti carbonara (I was hungry!).  The calamari was decent, but not as crispy as it should be, nor as hot.  It had probably sat for a bit.   The pasta was better - if I had only had that, and the service had been better, then this would be 3 stars
