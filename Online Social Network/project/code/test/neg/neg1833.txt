burke williams is my LA spot but i tried out bliss since i had a gilt city discount.  i've NEVER had a bad reaction to a facial, but after my triple oxygen facial at bliss my face got puffy and had little bumps everywhere.  i called the spa the next day about my reaction and the woman who answered the phone said someone would call me back the same day.  that was two weeks ago and still no call.  

besides my bad reaction i didn't find the esthetician to be all that friendly.  she scolded me for not knowing the name of my skin prescription and during the facial did not explain what she was doing.  at burke, they always give some little description of what they are about to put on your face and what it is made of.  the first thing at the bliss spa made me feel like my face was burning off.  it was hard to relax after that.  can't go back!  i'm forever loyal to burke williams.
