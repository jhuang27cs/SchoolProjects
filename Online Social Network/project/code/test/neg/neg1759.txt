I cannot recommend Dr. Adams. My children loved seeing Dr. Liu, which is why I continued seeing him in spite of several problems with his back office. I am so glad that Dr. Liu has opened his own practice not far away on Yale Street. 

Now my children can continue seeing Dr. Liu, but without all the problems that Dr. Adam's office had.
