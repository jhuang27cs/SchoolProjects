Really greedy provider that depends on people not looking at their bill. While natural gas prices have plummeted the past few years, they kept me on a variable rate that is nearly twice the going rate now without one phone call, email or mailer about how I could be a profitable customer to them even at a much lower rate. 

But miss a payment (which happened to us only when the post office or GNG lost a check) and they cut you off pronto and will treat you like you insulted their mom.
