I was NOT impressed with this place! I ordered the kimchi chigae, and what I got tasted like watered down kimchi, which was then heated up. Not good AT ALL. From what I ordered, the food didn't seem to be KOREAN so it was kind of weird. However, the place has great location in the Asian Ghetto, and if you're not looking for Korean, but you're looking for FOOD, then it's AAIIIGHHT.
