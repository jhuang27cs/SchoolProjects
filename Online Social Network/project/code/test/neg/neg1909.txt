Oh my, it seems like this place is not very ... well loved. 

And for good reason. 

You'll walk in and I swear - it smells delicious. The food is okay, not too good and not too bad. The only problem I've ever consistently had is that the portions always seem to be in flux. Some days they are decent sized, other days they are far less than what I paid for (taking into account this is the Ave). Also, I wouldn't trust their star system too much - on days the five star tastes like a two star and other days the five star is crazy spicy. 

What this place lacks is consistency. Except for their service which has always remained consistently....bad. They have always refilled my water, but they pretty much take your order, swipe your menus, drop your food and receipt off and thats it. Granted, the other places on the Ave aren't that much better. 

They seem to change their menus every two or three months and although the prices stay the same the portions keep getting smaller and smaller. 

Boooooo!!!!
