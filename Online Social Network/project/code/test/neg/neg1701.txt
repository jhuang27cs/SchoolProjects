What ya'll have, sweetheart?  Well, I was looking for at least a McDonald's experience, but I got more of a Checkers experience.  
Chili cheese dog - I can handle mushy white hot dog buns, but the naked dog was more like a skinny, salty turky dog.  The cheese is a piece of American and the chili is a bean-free, yucky brown meat variety.
Most diners were eating onion rings and ice cream, so I "might could" try some next time.
