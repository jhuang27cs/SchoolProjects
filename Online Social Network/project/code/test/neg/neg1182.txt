This is not a place for older folks. Its more for students and younger people. A lot of UCSD students live here and they park there cars in the middle of the roads while going back to school after lunch. The HOA sucks they do nothing.. The security guards do nothing but secure that your car gets towed. Even if you live here and have a wrong colored pass by mistake when you first move in,.. NO WARNING!!!!! I SWEAR the guards and Western Towing work together and they pay the security guards because they hunt like dogs to get cars towed. Beware of Western Towing cost is 300+ for having a wrong color pass. 

The good thing is the location is close to the stores and mall down the road. The pools and spas are nice as well as the BBQ's which you can use between 10am and 10pm.
