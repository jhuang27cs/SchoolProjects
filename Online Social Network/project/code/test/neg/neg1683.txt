My date and I were unfortunately unimpressed.

We started with the Tenderloin Flatbread Pizza.  An interesting experience - small chunks of steak, red onion, asiago cheese on a "sauce" of mashed potato on a flatbread.  It was a decent size for an appetizer, something like six slices, possibly worth the $12.

She got a flight of white wines which were all fairly good (though she disliked the earth toned one).

Then our dishes came out.  We opted for three half-portions.  The salmon was pretty good!  The gnocchi were so so, and the fettuccine was not really what I was expecting, which might account for my disappointment.

For a pretty expensive place (even by Ann Arbor standards), I was not as impressed as I perhaps should've been.
