RATING: 2.5 stars, rounded down (for inconsistency with food and management)
FOOD: 
Sin Waffle (Bananas, nutella)
ZInneken's Waffle (Whipped cream, Belgian chocolate, peanut butter like-spread)

QUICK SUMMARY:
Waffle = Good when its cooked well, not so good the second time when its slightly undercooked (noticeably chewy inside).
Toppings = Fresh, a big plus for the food.
Service = Erratic; first time it went relatively smooth. The second time the management was noticeably frustrated and made for an awkward eat-in.
Notables = First trip, they were out of waffles mid-day (thankfully I got my order in before). Second visit, issues with the credit card machine caused some management frustration, and they could only take cash. I noticed a few customers simply walk away during the incident.

SENTENCE SUMMARY:
"Calmer management and better consistency with the waffles would easily turn this place around; lets see if it happens."
