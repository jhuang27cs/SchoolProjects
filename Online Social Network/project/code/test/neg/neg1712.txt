I hate to give this place a bad review, since it's new and doesn't seem to be doing well--I'd guess about four of the twenty or so tables were taken tonight at 7. Still, if you're going to charge $15 an entree in downtown Berkeley, you'd better be offering some kickin' food and memorable atmosphere. Neither to be found here, I'm afraid.

The good:
The entrees were generally tasty. The chicken kebob was well cooked, and my giant lamb meatball with eggs and plums was a good blend of sweet and savory.
The entrees were generally generous. I was stuffed and had plenty to take home.
Lots of fresh herbs.

The bad:
Pretty boring menu. Yes, there are some distinctive dishes I'd never heard of before, but the large menu would look a lot smaller if you consolidated the 10 or so nearly identical kebob items and the not-so-Azeri pizzas.
So-so service. Despite the place being nearly empty, it took a little while to take our orders.
Lacking in veggies. A lot of the entrees are just meat and rice. The kebobs would be much better if they came with roasted peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc. And my friend got the "vegetarian option" of a lamb-and-eggplant dish, which just meant that they took out the lamb, replaced it with nothing, and charged the same price. Cute.
Pointless appetizers. In particular, the olives were bland and probably came out of a can.
Truly crappy bread. Lukewarm and day-old, I'd say.
