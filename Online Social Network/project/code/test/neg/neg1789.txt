Because it's cupcakes I can't give it one star. I mean I didn't have to spit them out, so it's not terrrrrible. But c'mon. $3.50 for one cupcake? In Harvard Square? Absurd. But because I love cupcakes more than pretty much anything else, I knew that I had to give it a try. 

As I stepped into Sweet I had high hopes. Super cute, like an old soda shop. The cupcakes were adorable, with high swirly frosting tops and an interesting array of flavors. We decided to try four regulars and two minis (note this was over $20). 

Meh. They were okay. They weren't particularly dry, nor were they moist. The frosting was not overly sweet but nor was it that ever-so-slight sugar cling that I look for in a cupcake. 

And they were about twice as much as they should have been.  For $3.50 in NYC I can get the jumbo S'mores cupcake from Crumbs and feed a small army.
