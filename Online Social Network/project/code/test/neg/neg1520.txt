Horrible customer service - food is fine based on prior experiences, but when I tried to make a reservation to use a LivingSocial voucher that was expiring in 2 days they would not accommodate, wouldn't let me use it on a Tuesday because of Tuesday $12.95 specials. No mention of this anywhere on LivingSocial or Acme website, nothing in the fine print. When I tried to offer alternatives, to pay normal menu prices if they would just let me eat there on Tuesday instead of Wednesday because I was going out town, I was quickly shut down and told they couldn't do anything. I will not go here again after dealing with unaccommodating and rude staff.
