Went in today for a mani/pedi with a voucher that was given to me for Mother's day..  This is the worst place I have been to (and I have been to a lot of salons).  The staff seemed rushed and uninterested in doing their job.  They failed to scrub my feet during the pedi (never had that happen before) , didn'T get any lotion on my hands during the mani and when she put the oil on it was massaged for about a whole minute.  Very disappointed!!
