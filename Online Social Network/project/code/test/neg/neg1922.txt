I ate there last night with a friend after he kept telling me how it was. We both got the beef bowl and after eating it we both got sick and threw up the entire night from their old meat. Right when the food came I told my friend that it looked like really cheap meat and that it didn't even look like beef. After eating it we both told ourselves that we will NEVER go there EVER again
