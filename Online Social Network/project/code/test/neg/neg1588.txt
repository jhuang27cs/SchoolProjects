It's a Bertucci's with the world's most brain-dead waitstaff.  What is it with this place?  Read the reviews, and you can see it's not only me.  Every single waiter we've had here (and it's been a different person each time) either takes FOREVER to take your order, deliver your order, bring you your check, or give you change or your credit card receipt or all combinations of those.  Who trains these people - how can every single one turn out to be so friggin pokey??  For an area that's dying for more lunch time options, they seem to operate on a model to discourage as many patrons who actually need to return to work at a reasonable hour.

If you have a serious craving for their roles or for their specialty pizzas, do yourself a favor and visit one of their other stores.   Other than that, plan to spend 2 hours here for chain food.
