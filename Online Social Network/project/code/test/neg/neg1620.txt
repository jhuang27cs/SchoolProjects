Apparently Google had a bunch of these cupcakes catered for an event, so my boyfriend brought a bunch of the leftovers home.  There was an assortment, coconut, chai, some kind of chocolate, cinnamon, red velvet, a few others... unfortunately, the weren't good or bad enough to be memorable.   

We cut up all the cupcakes to share and I didn't have a desire to finish any of them. To their credit, the coconut one and the cinnamon one were pretty tasty.  The cake was moister than the red velvet, but I still couldn't do the frosting on the coconut one because it was sickeningly sweet.  The cinnamon one didn't have frosting... and it was pretty good, compared to the others.  It just wasn't good cake, to me.  Maybe it was because the cupcakes were made that morning (or the night before?).  Or maybe something about their frosting is just too rich for me?

I still stand by my original review.  I guess I'm not a Sprinkles person.
