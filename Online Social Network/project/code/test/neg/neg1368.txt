The only thing this place really has going for them is the location - right in the heart of downtown.The food, on the other hand, can't quite live up to the location's charm.  

I've been here a few times and have to say I am less than impressed.  The prices for one thing are a bit ridiculous for sandwiches.  I was hoping at least the taste would make up for the price, but it didn't.  The bread was stale, and obviously cooked long before I arrived.  The chicken pieces were also unmistakably of the pre-package-defrosted-from-the-freezer variety, giving them that rubbery feel.  The sauce also had the distinct taste of coming from a can.

While overall the taste was far from horrible, the sandwich hardly deserved the price paid.  If you're looking for fresh, this is not the place.
