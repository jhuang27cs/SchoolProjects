I'm pretty much going to echo everyone else's review: meh.  There's no surprises here.  It's a college sports bar.  Lot's of TV's, decent specials, predictable menu/food.  The service I experienced during my visit seemed to be much better than other reviewers.  Also, free mini pizzas with any beer tower order.

Is a product of its location in University City, I would never go out of my way to visit this place.
