This place gets an O for Outstanding... if the characteristic in question is mediocrity.  

It just puts me to sleep.  What else can I say?  The fish in the fish & chips is tasteless.  The nachos are ok.  Calamari's fine, but it's pretty hard to screw that up, don't you think?

Nothing compelling about John Harvard's, but it will surely always rake in the cash b/c of the location & the blandness of the offerings.  As for me, I'll take my booty elsewhere.
