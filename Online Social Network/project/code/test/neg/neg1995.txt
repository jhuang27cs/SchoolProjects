Nice Sneakers, shitty service. I just went here on my lunch break..only 1 guy was working the store. I asked to see a shoe that was under the glass in the middle of the store and he helped me get the shoe out. I wanted to try on the other one so i went up to the register to find him...he disappeared. Meanwhile, 3 other dudes came out from the back room while i was just chilling at the register. Nobody offered to help. I even had my credit card out...but nothing. So fuck that..i bounced.
