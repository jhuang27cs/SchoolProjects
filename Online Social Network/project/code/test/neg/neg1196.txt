Really, I was not impressed by the gyro plate that I had.  The waiter was pleasant and so was the outdoor seating (though the seats are a bit uncomfortable out there).  You can purchase alcohol with your dinner - I'm a fan of enjoying a meal with a drink.

The food was just unspectacular and tasted a little weird.  You assemble your gyro out of the various pieces (pita, onion, tomato, rice, meat).  Frankly, if I'm going to pay as much as I did for it, it should already be built for me.  I think the meat needed some seasoning, or something.  It couldn't hold its own.  And yes, that's what she said.

If I ever find a reason to return to Parthenon, I would try the Pastitsio, which sounded great on paper.

For a good gyro, though, I recommend Alpha's Koney Island.  They've never let me down!
