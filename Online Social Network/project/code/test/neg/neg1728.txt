So I'm hungover, watching Sleeping with the Enemy and working on a Saturday.  Of course I'm getting delivery. 

I ordered the hanger steak and a shrimp and avocado roll.  

They did a good job being speedy - my hangover hunger wasn't making me particularly patient. They did a good job substituting vegetables for mashed potatoes - some restaurants don't even look at the delivery notes.  And the vegetables themselves were quite nice.  

But, good sides with a crappy entree? Not good. The steak smelled great - the begging dog to my left agreed. It was a perfectly cooked steak; unfortunately it was also the *saltiest*  "sauteed" steak I've ever had. It was Poodle the Bulldog's lucky day as she got nearly all of my steak, and I... well, I grabbed a beer to wash it all down, and went back to my pile of work and my Julia Roberts movie, no more satisfied than I was before the food arrived.
