I've lived here for 2 years as a 3rd-4th year UCSD student, and had great time here. But that was ONLY because my roommates were awesome and because we were able to make the best of our situation.

The apartment itself, along with its service, leasing administration, parking, and prices were horrible.

PROs:
- Great location - close to UCSD, close to the shuttle route, close to VONS. In fact, this is the main reason La Regencia is so popular. Come for the location, because everything else is shitty.

- Easy access: The gates/entrances are usually broken, so friend can easily walk in and visit. Friends can usually park in the VONs parking lot during the day. Towing is rare if they leave before 12am.

- Fewer parties/noise ... than say, Costa Verde. At times, you will need to sleep before 12am, and you'll appreciate having quiet neighbors. It still gets pretty noisy before 12am, but there are definitely fewer parties here.

CONs:
- Parking - You get 2 parking spots, usually 1 behind the other. There are no exceptions, and you can't purchase any new parking stops. Finding parking on the street after 11pm is harder than finding a needle in a haystack. At you know the needle exists. We had 6 cars to deal with, so you can imagine how difficult it was with us.

- La Regencia Maintenance - This place is beyond ghetto for repairs. Their elevators are broken every week. The day I moved in, I got stuck in an elevator with my parents for 5 minutes. The gates and doors are often broken (which actually is a good thing ... but GHETTO).

- Individual Apartment Maintenance - Maintenance is surprisingly fast at repairing anything that needs fixing in the apartment, usually within 2 days. However, they're ignore most of your requests. In addition, they'll never call you to notify when they're dropping by EVEN IF YOU'VE SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED FOR THEM TO CONTACT YOU. As a result, only 1/3 of your maintenance requests are answered and fixed.

- Service/administration - Simply stated: The staff at the leasing office are mean as hell and some of the coldest people I've talked to. I can always find something nice to say about everyone, but nothing comes to mind. The apartment is run like a strict, cold bureaucracy. They're only interested in getting your signatures on contracts. They will also periodically contact you to notify you that your rent has gone up.

- Fire alarms: There are 2-4 every year. They are loud, annoying, and installed in every bedroom. They also occur only at night around 3am before your 8am midterm. 9/10 times, it's a false alarm.

- Prices: Pricing is all right, at least when you first sign the leasing form. And then every year, the rent increases by $100 until you're paying $1900 for a 2-room or $2400 for a 3-room apartment. With those prices, it's better to find a nicer place.
