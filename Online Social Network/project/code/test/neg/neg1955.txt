I used to come here and used to enjoy the food...... what happened? 

In the past 2 months I came with my friends and the first time, it stunk like fish as soon as we stepped in the door... a good sushi place is not supposed to smell. It didn't sit well in my stomach....

2nd time I took my sister, we ordered sushi and this time it did not smell so I took the risk. We asked for some extra sauce and she wanted to charge extra... we said wow never mind. The service was ok and so was the food so my sister didn't tip well. As we were walking out, the asian woman came behind us to tell us we made a mistake on the tip. That is soooo tacky... as a business that was very unprofessional and would not be going there again..... by the way, we didn't change the tip amount.
