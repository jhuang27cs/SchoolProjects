This may be the worst Thai food I've ever had.

The noodles I ordered were very very saucy/watery. Same went for my friend. It's disappointing when somebody messes up something as simple as a stir fry. Plus, the restaurant is a bit dark and depressing.

Though there aren't that many places in Princeton to eat at, this is one to definitely avoid.
