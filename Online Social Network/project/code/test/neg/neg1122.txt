From my last review, I have confirmed that this place is definitely going down a slippery slope. It used to be the best deal in Westwood because of the food quality and the price, but both has gone down dramatically in the past 4 years. First of all, they raised the price of each plate about 1-2$, which is acceptable if the quality did not go down. 

Quality: The meat is getting drier and drier with each visit. I fear that I will be ordering beef jerky with my next visit. I just ordered a combination plate today, when I opened it, I found that they filled half the plate with chicken, and the other half with cardboard textured beef, and no bolgogi at all (which stated that there was bolgogi in the menu)! Furthermore, the sauce packages that they give are decreasing in amount with every visit, this time all the teriyaki and siracha to go packets were half filled.  Next time it will probably just be the container.

This place is going down hill. I would love to give the owners a piece of mine about how bad their restaurant is running.
