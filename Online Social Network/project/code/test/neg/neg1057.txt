What is up with the sizes?! There was barely any rice on the rolls. Each piece was about the size of a quarter. Serious. I get the happy hour thing... but really? Just put it at normal price if you're going to cheap out like that. We got about six rolls. Every roll had about half an inch of filling (fish, cucumber, avocado, etc). I think you would be better off getting your sushi elsewhere. If you want sushi, or even decent sushi, I suggest you spend a few more dollars somewhere else. You literally get your money's worth. The atmosphere isn't that great either. Its like the malls about to be shut down or something. Weird. That being said, I'm quite surprised by the high marks on Yelp!
