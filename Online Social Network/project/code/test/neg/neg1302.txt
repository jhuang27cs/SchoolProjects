Worst brunch experience ever. The service is non-existent. Slow and careless. The staff actually avoids eye contact to prevent you from asking something. The waitress didn't even let me finish my order before walking away. After that I had to serve myself from the counter for basically everything, except that soon cups, water and spoons were gone, so I basically had to pick up dirty ones and rinse them myself.

The coffee is bad and carelessly prepared. Towards the end of the meal I was briefly blessed with the attention of the owner, who got the girl to remake my cappuccino. She took three attempts and still couldn't make me one that wasn't a bathtub full of milk with one espresso shot.

The food is ok, but definitely not worth waiting an hour for in those conditions. Unless you take the situation in stride and laugh off the ridiculous service as a comic skit.
