One star for the Club Mex, One for having Mr. Pibb.

The best chick sandwich is at Einstein Bagels. The restaurant is a craphole but the Club Mex sandwich is divine. You just have to make sure they use the ancho-lime-mayo, leave out the purple onions, put it on challah bread, and don't forget the jack cheese or bacon. It takes a lot of bird-dogging, but it's worth it!

Other than that, the coffee is bleh, pastries are so-so, fruit is almost too ripe to eat. Bagel dogs are good though and keep all day so you can buy them at lunchtime and eat them for dinner.
