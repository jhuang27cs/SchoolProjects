I came here about two weeks ago, and it was my first time ever at a tanning salon. The girl that was working was not very helpful when I was asking her questions about which lotions to use. It seemed like she just wanted to try to sell a whole bunch of products and memberships instead of trying to provide real customer service. When I asked her what I should do if I didn't want to tan my face, she looked at me as if I was dumb, and said, " You just put a towel on your face." Okay...if I were an experienced tanner, then maybe I'd know that, but I don't know jack balls when it comes to tanning salons. When I went to the tanning bed, she just said very quickly how to use the bed and abruptly left. If it wasn't easy to figure out how to use the beds I would have been like WTF. I think I'm going to stick to attempting to tan my pale skin out in the sun instead of coming back here. Also good thing I had a free session when I went because this girl did not provide the right customer service to make me want to get a membership or to even come back.
