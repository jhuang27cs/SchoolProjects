I'll make this review short, as this place is not even worth the time.  I completely agree with Mando M. below.  This place is straight out of a nightmare.  

I was a bridesmaid for my cousins wedding, and we purchased our dresses from this vendor.  Laurie, the owner, is super rude and so unprofessional.  She was like this from the very start, until the very end of the whole process.  Granted, she gave my cousin a great deal on the bridesmaids dresses, but man did we get what we paid for!  First off, the dresses came MUCH later than what was promised to us.  Then, when the dresses did come, they were a completely different shade of the color that my cousin ordered!  All Laurie could say was too bad but it's too late!  Geesh!  And then get this, when we all picked up our dresses, she straight dropped it in a bag and said here you go!  This chick did not even bother to hang it! Haha **I'm laughing my butt off right now because it is pretty funny** .  I mean WOW, talk about unprofessional.  It's almost unethical to treat your customers like that who just paid a great deal of money for a dress.

It's funny because there was a really beautiful lace bridal gown that we were trying to convince my cousin to buy from this place when we first ordered our dresses.  Oh thank goodness she didn't buy her gown from this place! Imagine!!!!  

Okay, this review is longer than promised hehe.  But yeah, do yourselves and your wedding a favor, STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AS POSSIBLE!!!
