The birthplace of the caffe latte, Caffe Med is a good place to frequent if you want some good, relatively cheap caffeine while soaking in the Berkeley atmosphere. Their lattes aren't the best I've ever had, but they're pretty good. I wouldn't recommend their iced teas, though; I've tried them twice, and once it was just ice water (almost tasteless) and the next time it was super sweet. It's nice to just get a pot of tea here (works out cheap) and sit and get my reading done.  

I like going here because it's near my apartment. However, the service is frustratingly slow and their internet isn't always reliable. The place has a definite Berkeley vibe to it, and is rich with history and culture, but I've grown tired of the eccentric people who frequent this cafe. It's good, cheap, and has convenient timings, but it's not my favorite Berkeley cafe.
