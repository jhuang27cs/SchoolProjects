This place was crap. I made the mistake of ordering a shrimp pasta with alfredo. Shrimp were tiny, few in number, and managed to have some strange aftertaste, possibly due to the alfredo sauce, which tasted more like the stuff you would get from a powder mix then the decadent cream and cheese mix it's supposed to be.

Awesome Blossom onion was way too salty, coming from someone who enjoys food on the salty side.

Dessert was pretty much something I'd imagine buying from Ralph's in terms of texture and quality.

Service was OK. Oh, right, and the parking situation deserves some mention, seeing as it's Westwood. Good luck finding it.
