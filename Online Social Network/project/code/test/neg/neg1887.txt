I pretty much second everyone's reviews on how great the pizza is. However, the service at this place SUCKS. The girls at the front counter are so rude. After they hung up on me once while I was trying to order, they kept putting me off for "10 minutes", even after I had spoken with the owner or manager about us ordering from there in the future. Giuseppe was extremely rude on the phone, to the point where I ended up just cancelling my order. The pizza is phenomenal, but there are many days where it's just not worth dealing with uppity pizza nazi's to eat it.
