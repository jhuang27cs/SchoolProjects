Yes, I've been to Mongols plenty of times, even though I went to school on the other side of town.  And looking back, I think it was just the draw... nay, the challenge... of creating a tower of food.  I even had a friend who got yelled at for being creative with use usage of the one allotted bowl. The food was better quality back then.  Now... not so much.  

But now I've seen the light... there are so many better Mongolian options with much better ingredients AND all you can eat.  Also better flavors, easier to get to, cleaner, yadda yadda...

Really, I think this should be a one star place, but the 2nd star is for sentimental value.
