Was visiting from out of state so stopped by to purchase some Cal gear for my kids.  Later in the week, I realized that they forgot to take the sensor tag off one of the shirts. Since we were staying in SF, I called to find out how to get the sensor tag off and the clerk who answered said that I could take it to a certain clothing store (a national store but not easily found outside of California).  I found one close to where we were staying in SF, but when I brought it there, they didn't use the same type sensor tag, so they couldn't remove it.  Called the store back and the clerk said I could bring it back to Berkeley with my receipt and they could remove it.  When I explained that I was staying in SF and would be leaving the next day, he recommended Rasputins Record Store because they are part of the same network, but he didn't know where the store was located in SF.  I asked if he knew of any other store in case they couldn't do it or I couldn't find it, and he suggested that I "would have to do some research by calling other stores on my own" but he couldn't help.   Fortunately, I was able to find Rasputins and they were very nice about it.  Still, I think from now on I will purchase my Bear gear from a nationwide chain with better service - ex. Costco or Target.  Not worth it to support a local business unless you actually live locally in this case.
