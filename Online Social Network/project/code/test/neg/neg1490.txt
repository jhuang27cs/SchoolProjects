So, can we say poor service? Can we say poor service? The food was ok-nothing to write home about- but the service- horrible .

There was a group of 8 of us, and the waiter could not come by to refill water, when we had empty plates, nobody would pick them up, and if we waved them down there was no response.

The place wasn't too busy and I guess I can see why.

SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE.
