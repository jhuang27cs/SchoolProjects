There is only one word that describes Tealuxe - YUCK.  From the very, VERY disgusting bathroom that looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months to the table tops full of crumbs to the watery pumpkin chai latte that made me feel sick to my stomach with the first sip I took, my opinion of Tealuxe is that it's gross and was a complete waste of money and time.  My husband and I like our chai lattes, and were pretty excited to come across a place that specialized in tea and advertised pumpkin chai lattes as well as other tempting drinks on the window.  Well... we should have thought twice.  Compounding the grossness of Tealuxe was the service... two very gossipy high school girls who took their sweet time making our drinks and acting annoyed at the sight of us.  I was about to ask to have my chai redone because it was gross and cost $5.00, but then a bunch of folks came in who were apparently friends of the girls at the counter and it turned into a gab fest.  So, my husband and I said forget it, left, and threw our full drinks away in a garbage can outside.  Waste of money.  Tealuxe will definitely not get my business again.  I really hope the store manager reads this, tells the baristas here to get their acts together, and cleans that darn bathroom.
