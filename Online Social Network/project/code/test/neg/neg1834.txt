I ordered a breakfast sandwich here -- menu listed a price of $3.25 and they tried to charge me $5.75... what the hell? I find it kind of hard to believe that was a mistake. If you get overcharged here, definitely speak up. That's not ok.

Reading the reviews and seeing how completely empty this place was, I feel a little bad for the couple running Cafe Rio. They probably aren't making enough money, but it's still not ok to overcharge! If you want it to cost $5.75 fair enough, but put that price on the menu and don't try to tell me the difference is "tax."

The sandwich itself was fine. Pretty standard cheap breakfast fare.
