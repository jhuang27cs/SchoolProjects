Simply put I'm writin my review to further degrade this businesses star rating. I really can't say anything new. I came in, gave the blank look of "help...please...anyone," finally caught the attention of an employee who found it much to difficult to walk from behind the counter to show me where the fax machines or single envelopes were. A vague general pointing motion was all she could muster. 

The fax machine worked fine. It showed awesome enthusiasm and answered all my questions in a concise way that left me feeling ok about spending $6 to send 2 faxes.

But then it was back to the shipping center where it tool 20 minutes to get through 2 people in line. Then to top it off the vague pointing that I had encountered earlier had apparently encompassed showing me the shipping forms and explaining that it was common practice to fill a form out before approaching the shipping center... My bad... this 

All in all I spent nearly an hour to send 2 letters and 2 faxes. Never again.
