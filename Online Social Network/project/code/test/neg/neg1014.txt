After years of ignoring my knee issue the pain got to be too much and I had to have it looked at. Dr King came highly recommended. At first he seemed nice and friendly, knowledgeable. I was taken aback when he said that I needed BOTH knees done at once but only my left knee was bothering me. I had no issues with my right one. He told me I would. I trusted him and went ahead with a double knee surgery. Luckily it was just for a tear. When I awoke my knee felt no better. He told me to take a vicodin every 4 hrs even knowing I was home with a 3 yr old alone. I had little help at home. He told me to just stop if it hurt....well how was I to feel anything on that much pain meds? He sent me to PT and within a week my knee swelled up and hurt. It was red & painful. I couldnt reach him or Laurel in any way. My PT took one look and handed me the phone and said call your Dr now, your knee is infected. I finally got into see him and he was less than pleased, like I was bothering him. He said that it was just a sucher or something and went ahead to dig around in my knee after only a spray of something to numb it , which didnt work. I was in tears on the table with my little girl watching the whole thing. He dug around and then finally said, oh I think you have an infection. Well DUH. His bedside manner changed as soon as I had my surgery. I dont know what he actually did to my knee if anything because it was a mess and no better. I was messed up for a year and had to get another dr, to have another surgery to fix the mess and with that surgery it was instant the moment I got up. He had fixed my knee issues and its been great since. King is all image and arrogant, attitude and might be great if youre a Raider but for the average Joe, hes the worst. My story is nothing, I have heard far worse. He has had many complaints and lawsuits even I believe for surgeries gone wrong. I will NEVER see him again. Stay away.
