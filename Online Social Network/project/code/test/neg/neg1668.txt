I love the pink/brown duo and I will admit that this is what drew me in, even though in my experience, these 'trend' pastry shops are all appearance. 

These were positively the worst cupcakes I've ever had. These make box mixes taste like they are homemade from scratch. I've had cupcakes from various other chains like Sprinkles or the famous Georgetown Cupcake (neither of which are my favorite either, but still considerably better than Sweet) and this one tops The Worst List. 

The cupcake was dry, flavorless and the icing was too sweet. They were extremely overpriced. At Sprinkles they are expensive as well, but at least those are moist and edible. Additionally, Sprinkles' (the original 'cupcake' chain) cupcakes are at least huge, worth the fare comparatively speaking. 

My advice if you're reading this? You are in Cambridge (or Boston, because Sweet has unfortunately spread) and there are TONS of delicious pastry shops and cupcakes abound far better. 

Barnes and Nobles Cafe Chocolate or Red Velvet
Mike's Pastry (always a hit for a sweet tooth, albeit not cupcakes)
Au Bon Pain introduced some delicious cupcakes
I know Brighton has an international bakery somewhere close to the Whole Foods, which has gotten praise from many friends and family

and tons of other choices well worth the $4+ you drop here for a piece of colored chalk and a milk.
