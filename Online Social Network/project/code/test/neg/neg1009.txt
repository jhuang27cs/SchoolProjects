I used to go to Bellanina religiously for the Cosmaseutical Facial. Since I had found a great esthetician, I stuck with the pain of the front desk staff who were nearly always rude. When my esthetician left, I continued to see others for the facial, however was eventually turned off completely by the shortness of the front desk staff. Sorry, folks, it's important that the first people that customers see and are greeted by are smiling.
