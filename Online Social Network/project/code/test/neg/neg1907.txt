Cafe only two blocks from my apartment with a tasty and expansive menu including any flavor of fro yo you can image? One would think I would be there on a weekly basis.  Instead, I have had to make a pact with my husband never to return there.  Why? THE STAFF ARE MISERABLE. Or, I should clarify, the manager is miserable.  I have been there only a handful of times, and each time he found some way to ruin the visit.  He has yelled at other staff in front of me, made snarky comments as I am trying to order, and on one occasion got into a straight up argument with my husband about why he felt it was totally normal for him to have pictures of sandwiches on his menu that he does not actually sell.... My advice is skip the experience altogether, but if you desperately need some fro yo on a Sunday afternoon, make sure you have your shields up.
