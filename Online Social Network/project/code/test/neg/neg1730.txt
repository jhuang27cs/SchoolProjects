I don't know why, but I went in again with a friend. The girl at the counter turned to smile and say hello, but for some reason when she saw us, quickly turned away, the smile turning into a scowl. I *swear* I'm not overly-sensitive, or a trouble maker. I don't gallivant around yarn stores singing at the top of my lungs or strip dance on the tables: I go in, I check out the selection and see if anything suits my current projects, and I leave. I was the one looking for yarn, and my friend was obviously accompanying me- she sat herself down at the big table in the store with a book to wait, and was immediately offered assistance while I was duly ignored. I hate playing the racism card, but dudes. This is unacceptable. I don't know wtf is up with this place, but I am NOT coming back EVER.
