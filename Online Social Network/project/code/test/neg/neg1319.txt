We usually go here for a late dinner. Always receive pretty okay service, until last night, it was just horrible. 

It was fairly busy. We weren't seated by the usual friendly hostess, we were seated by some other woman who didn't even ask if anyone in the party was vegetarian. I asked for one vegetarian menu and she literally throws it in my direction as if i'm supposed to catch it.

We sit there for about 20 minutes while waiters and other staff continually pass us. A waitress stops (one of the many who passed our table dozens of times) and asked if we had been helped. I told her we hadn't, she takes our drink order and disappears for another few minutes. 

She eventually takes our order and never comes back until it's time to deliver the check. In the meantime, all her other tables in our area are getting a lot more attention than us. We never got refills, had to flag her down for plates, napkins, condiments, etc. I barely ate my food, just packed it up and left.

Overall, not a great experience and I probably won't dine in again. May consider take out since the food is decent and cheap.
