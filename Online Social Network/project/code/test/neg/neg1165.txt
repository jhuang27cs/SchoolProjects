I used to think this place was awesome. That was before I knew what hooka was. Now that I've had a little more experience I know that the hooka here is way over priced. Not to mention the food is expensive and sucky.

Oh yeah and they have specials so you gotta be careful. Like one night i went with my friend and it was like a 15 dollar minimum per person or something and we just wanted hooka. THey didn't tell us this till after we sat down so we had to order food and lets just say it didn't take long for us to rack up 15 bucks a person. 

Wouldn't recommend it unless you like loud music, crowded places, and mediocre hooka. 

However it has bright lights and cool decor so maybe you should try it at least once just to say you have.
