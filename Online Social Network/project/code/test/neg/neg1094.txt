Be Careful!  

My therapist here was good, but the people who work in reception & billing really messed things up for me.  They canceled my first appointment 30 mins.  before I was meant to arrive, then when I was 10 mins late to the second appointment, they refused to see me.  They don't know what they are doing with insurance.  They ordered too many appointments, appointments I did not need and the had obviously NOT consulted my therapist about.  This messed up my insurance & will end up costing me a lot of money.

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!  go somewhere with professionals who will deal with your personal information with respect.
