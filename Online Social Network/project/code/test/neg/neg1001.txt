Not the best Chipotle, actually probably the worse I've been, the service is minimal, but most importantly the portions are small, wayyyy too male centric, where are the girls????  Also just go to La Burrita is you want to go to Mexican.  Two stars because I do still go there, but probably less than once every 6 months.
