What snots they are in this store! I went in to get my vintage engagement ring fixed up (the day after I got it). The extremely fake blond Reaganite  behind the counter was sooooo condescending, asking me questions about its provenance and workmanship in a tone of voice clearly designed to plant doubt in my mind. They told me fixing it would take $100 and I'd have to give it up for a week. They told me it was worth it because their jeweler is German, and "you know how Germans are about workmanship!" (Whew -- ethnic stereotypes are so reassuring!) 

When I said I'd have to think about it, she warned me in a fake-caring voice, "Well, I'd be very careful about moving your hands around while you're wearing it, you don't know what could happen at any time!"

I decided to get the work done in Pasadena instead. They did it while I waited (not a week). No attitude, MUCH cheaper, and It's gorgeous and perfect. Oh, and I wore the ring all week and nothing bad happened at all. Take that, fake blond lady!
