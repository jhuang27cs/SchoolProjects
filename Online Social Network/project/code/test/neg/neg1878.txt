Crocodile Cafe is one of those places you want to like, the area, the food, but the 3 out of 4 times I've been there has been consistent..  

Consistently bad.  Each time we get shown a table it's right in the middle of the traffic area, waitresses and customers walking by, we felt like we were in the middle of the la freeway eating dinner.   Service was subpar.  The food looked good, but was average at best.   I mention 3 out of 4 because the 4th time, the waitress tried to put us in the traffic area again and looking at my wife's disappointment, I told them no thank you, and we left to go to a restaurant we knew would seat us appropriately.
