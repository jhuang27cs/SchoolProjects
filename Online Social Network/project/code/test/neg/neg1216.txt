Another place that is close by and I really want to like, but just cant convince myself I enjoy their food. Most everything on their menu is fried save for the raw bar (which I'm leery ordering off of after getting insanely sick last year after eating peel and eat shrimp). They do have a good beer selection and a very nice rooftop deck (though they could use a bathroom up there!). But if you like fried food and have a big bladder, than this could be the place for you!

FYI - during football season, they usually have half priced appetizers (including crab legs) on Sundays!
