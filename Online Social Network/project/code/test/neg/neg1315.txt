Mediocre chinese food for absurdly cheap prices.  Absolutely the only reason to go here is if you are working on the North side of campus and are hungry for lunch - the place is full of engineering students with no gastronomical inclinations and even less money.  

I have noticed that if you order in Chinese your food comes out noticeably different and slightly tastier.  I now only go here with my Chinese coworker, and he orders for me.
