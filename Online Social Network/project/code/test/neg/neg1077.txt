got some deal with chicken, rice, salad and a bubble tea. chicken was okay..only average and the bubble tea was way too sweet. one great thing was that you got to choose jelly instead of tapioca..and i haven't had jelly in a long time..so i had to get some.

for the price, i don't think it's too bad.  however, it's not something that is out of the ordinary. something just to quench your thirst and fill your stomach.
