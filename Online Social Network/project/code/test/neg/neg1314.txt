Ah yes... Seven THIEVES Market. When I lived in the Foothill dorms without a car 14 years ago this was my go-to place for soft drinks. I would have bought more but their prices were ridiculously high, and I found Berkeley Market on Telegraph to do the rest of my shopping. Many a time I lugged a six pack on each arm up the Hearst St.reet hill.
