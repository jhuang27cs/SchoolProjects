Village Copier used to be a reliable source for printing services -- need a poster? Done. School report need binding? Taken care of.

What's disappointing, though, is their customer service! Unfortunately, I called in to get a printout of a design I created. I thought it would be simple and convenient, since the lady I spoke to on the phone indicated that I could e-mail them my design. She gave me a final price, but failed to inform me of a "digital surcharge" of $3, which was three times as much as the cost of the work itself. Why it costs $3 to open up a PDF file (umm...21st century?) is beyond me, but at the very least, they should inform their customers of this charge!

Next time, I'll take a hike down to Global Copy.
