Once is enough and now it is off my bucket list. Pastry (Cherry Strudel) was mediocre, iced tea was average, service was bad as the server seemed annoyed to be serving and on top it was crowded and hard to find a table even though it is August - can't imagine what it would be like during the school year. Go to Max Cafe instead much better
