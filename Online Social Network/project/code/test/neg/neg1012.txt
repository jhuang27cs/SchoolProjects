I dont know what the rave reviews are about on this place.

I thought the atmosphere was cool enough, it has that run down greasy burger joint look to it. Though t I would order the classic Burger and Onion Rings. Food took forever to arrive at the pickup window. When the food finally arrived my burgrer was a soggy mess that looked like something run over by a truck. The onion rings were previously frozen and tasted just herendous.

Althoe it beats McDonalds Ive had a better experiance at Whataburger.

Might stop in again for a beer sometime again after work, but never to eat.
