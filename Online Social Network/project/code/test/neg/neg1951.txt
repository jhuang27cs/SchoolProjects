The 2-star rating is because the food was not awful this time.  I got three tacos, all of which were pretty good, and it was cool that they were each $2 since I went on a Tuesday.  At least the food wasn't as bad as the last time I went there and got bland fajitas and lumpy cold queso with greasy chips.

3 stars are missing because the experience was overall bad.  It took them over 30 minutes to bring out our tacos from the time we ordered.  This was after we sat there for about 5 minutes waiting on someone to take our order.  We actually sat there and watched two other couples, who were seated after us, get their food before us.  The first couple actually finished their meals, paid, and left before our food came, while the other couple got both an appetizer and their meals before we got ours.  We actually had to ask our waitress to check on our food, and she told us "I'm sorry, but we have a lot of people here today."  Yeah, a lot of people that came in after us that needed to be served first, apparently.

They also tried to seat us at a "booth" that is made out of 2 rows of 3 old seats from an airplane.  While that looks cool from a distance and seems charming, the airline seats were disgustingly filthy and sat too low.  I'm all for innovative decor and charm, but only if it's done right and if you're not lazy about it.  Do yourself a favor and don't let them seat you there.

The best part is their health inspection score, which we noticed as we were getting ready to leave.  It's a 29, with a grade of "U."  That's right, the other reviewers are not exaggerating.  Their last one from April was a 52.  How do you go from a 52 to a 29?!  They obviously just don't care.  Bad service, mediocre food, and a 29???  I really don't know how this place is still open.  Not acceptable.  Don't go.  Even with a $25 coupon that costs $5-$10 on Half-Off Depot, it's still not really worth the health risk or time to go there.
