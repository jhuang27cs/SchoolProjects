We had a terrible experience at the cafe on Saturday. We entered and stood at the register for about 5 minutes and the cashier came and logged the register on but would not speak to me. There were two staff in the cafe but neither would acknowledge  us in any way, would  not speak, would not wait on us it was very rude. I will not be going back anytime soon. The Manager, well I assume she was was yelling and being grumpy to the other staff person. I have never been treated this rudely in a restaurant and think something should be done about the staff before this cafe is ruined!!
