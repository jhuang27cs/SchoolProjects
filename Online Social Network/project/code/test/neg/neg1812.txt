Not thrilled with the beef phad see yew or the Thai iced tea. The latter was way too sweet and had too little of the iced-tea taste. I suppose that means too much of the condensed milk and sugar. As for the main dish, everything just seemed overdone (with the exception of the broccoli). The rice noodles were clumpy in the extreme (probably the most disappointing part). The beef was pretty flavorless. And the sauce was thick.

It's possible some of their other dishes are better, but I think phad see yew is pretty standard and should come out pretty well no matter where you go. So I'm rather disappointed.

I was also surprised the server didn't even offer to box up my leftovers for me -- she just handed me a box with a plastic bag inside. I actually do like boxing up my own stuff, but do expect the server to at least offer first.
