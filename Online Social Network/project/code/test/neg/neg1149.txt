Man this place has really regressed since it first opened a few years ago. I came here at prime dinner time and there was only one person eating. Since it's so empty, I guess it's pretty good for large parties - not too expensive, semi-decent food. 

They charge an extra 35 cents if you use a credit card without a $12 minimum. I got some chicken pasta for take-out, and it totaled about ~$9. Taste was mediocre. As I took bites I kept wishing I had just walked the extra few blocks to Gypsy's. lol. 

Sorry Milanese Caffe!
