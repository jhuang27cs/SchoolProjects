I ordered my wedding cake from here. I had to do it over the phone which I regret now. I would advise to go in for a tasting. It was the only place in town that does wedding cakes. Well I was not impressed by the look of it. It was rather sloppy. I expected a little more for the price I paid. When it came time to cut into it, the buttercream crumpled off the cake and it was so dry. It was really sad to see everyone pretending they enjoyed it. We even bought a small chocolate mouse cake for those who would not like the mango flavor we choose and that was dry too. So disappointing.
