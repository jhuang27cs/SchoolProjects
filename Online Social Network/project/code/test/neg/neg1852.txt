I have been going to some of the best spa's my whole life around the country. When I wanted to do a couples massage for my boyfriend and I, I decided to try out Amadeus on Green St. The ambiance is horrible, slightly felt like a doctors office with more relaxing music. The locker rooms were small, the waiting room was tiny and exposed to everyone when it should be more of a relaxing area. Then on top of it, the massage therapists were barely OK to say the least. I really was not impressed. I did 90 min massages for us, and cost me WAY too much money for the type of service and ambiance. I really was disappointed, and will never return.
