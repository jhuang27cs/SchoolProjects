As this is an Asian restaurant, i expected what i normally receive at an Asian restaurant -- tasty flavorful food.  I was dismayed and disappointed that i did not receive that here.  I have had samosas b4 and the ones here were surprisingy bland.  The entree was terrible.  My companion and i both ordered the same one and agreed on our negative opinion of it.  I have never had basil chicken that was creamy in like a curry sauce.  But i could deal with that, but the bad part was that the chicken was ALL dark meat and of poor quality.  We expected that with the elevated price and the ambiance that food would be of a higher quality than what you can get from the neighborhood take-out Chinese joint.  Sadly the (very slightly) chicken-flavored rice, was the best item we had.  And to add insult to injury, i had an OpenTable.com reservation there (1,000 points) and the hostess accidentally canceled it instead of accepting it.  It took 2 weeks for me to get the points.  Technically i don't know if it took that long b/c of the restaurant or opentable.com, but either way, the restaurant shouldn't have screwed up the reservation and my points.  My companion and i vowed to never return.  I'll end on a positive note tho.  The waiter and the hostess were both very courteous, so the service wasn't lacking.
