Lucy's is grounds... [fill-in]. I will expound. This will be fun. Get ready for some wild rabbit trails.

Lucy's is grounds... found on Holy Grounds. It is located at the Hillel building. Being set in the courtyard, it has really found a cool location. Plus, could they sell things that WEREN'T kosher? Probably not. Food trucks for those of Jewish decent! Talk about a synergistic  integration of Austin and culture and religion.

Lucy's is grounds... offering Coffee Grounds, in ground form, brewed, and then moved onto the liquid form. That was a stretch.

Lucy's is grounds... Grounds for true ethnic grubbage. With a menu boasting homemade hummus (Tom's and Out To Lunch, though local and awesome, are monopolizing the "housemade" hummus market!--have you viewed this trend?), falafel, and even apple strudel.

Alas, what did I think? Quite mediocre. The veggie stew was certainly heavy on the veggies, but it was a touch bland, one-noted, and it honestly was just too oily. I don't mind heavy soups, but unless it is well homogenized, I find that oily film that collects at the top and creeps on the sides of the container unappealing and distasteful. This one is chock full of peas and green beans. It also possessed an off-putting smell.

The apple strudel was soggy--pretty sure these things are supposed to hold the utmost crispness and flaky character. The filling was OK, at best.

Would I return? Maybe. Anticlimactic conclusion following such an insightful post? Yes. I worked you up with my awesome rhetoric. Lucy's Fried Chicken, Lucy's European Cuisine, Lucy's Retired Surfer Bar. I get the point; Lucy's is a fun name to use in this day and age. But... the grub NEVER holds up to the iconic American diner proclamation, this aspect being found in the name Lucy's.
