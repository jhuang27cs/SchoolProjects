DH dropped off some pants for dry cleaning.  When we got them back one pant wasn't even cleaned.  For the price this isn't something you can overlook.  When we brought it to their attention they fixed it promptly, but were unapologetic about it.  Plus we had to wait another 4-5 days.  I won't be back
