The cakes are gorgeous and absolutely delicious.  As a bride-to-be I have taste tested more cake than I care to admit, and theirs are among the best.

However, I had a wedding cake consultation there and they never followed up.  With the other vendors I have visited, I have been e-mailed a proposal of sorts afterwards, so I've come to think that's pretty standard.  After not hearing anything, I shot them a quick e-mail and got no response.  Granted, I could have tried harder to contact them, but when other perfectly good bakers are taking the initiative to earn my business (and face it, weddings are big business) I'm not going to exert much effort on my end.  A shame, considering their cakes are 5 stars.
