The employees here are somewhat unwelcoming. Put on a smile once in a while, yeah? I've gotten better service from a Chinese restaurant waitress in the SGValley than what this waitress did. At least the busboy(the guy that cleaned tables and brought us our water) was happy to get us an extra set of utensils. This guy should replace the waitress.

3 item bento box: spicy chicken, sesame chicken, and bulgogi. Spicy chicken was alright. Sesame chicken was tasteless; ask for spicy mayo and drench those suckers. Bulgogi had a weird taste to it, but gradually got less weird as you ate it.

Some of the sushi rolls are plain; I tried a piece and I couldn't tell what it was.

Pricing is pretty expensive for what you get. Anyway, I suppose this place is alright if you live near the UCLA campus, but there are tons of better places in LA. No real reason to come here, in my opinion.
