I usually love this place, their food is always excellent.  Before the last time i went i would give it 5 stars for the food.  

Unfortunately a few days ago my GF and I are both got food poisoning and have been sick for days.  There is no doubt it was from this meal.  I am guessing the al pastor bc it didnt taste like it usually does.  

Also the place is dirty, which disturbed me before, but i thought nothing of it till now.
