Imagine going to Dennys and paying $37 for a meal for you and your SO. When someone said "pricey for diner food," they weren't joking! My SO got a steak sandwich because the cheapest, plainest burger on the menu was just under $9, so he figured that if was going to spend some change, he might as well get something decent. I ordered a half-sandwich (BLT) and cup of soup (Chili). We each got drinks (nothing special like a milkshake, just a soda and juice). The service was mediocre, the place was a little dirty, and the ambiance just wasn't anything to write home about. At these prices, I really expected better quality food and better service. The food wasn't terrible, but really... the dollar to experience ratio is probably the lowest I've experienced in a long time. I don't mind spending more for something special, but this is far from it and nothing like the original Peninsula Creamery.
