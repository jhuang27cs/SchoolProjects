Terrible, terrible service.  We had an early dinner with my father-in-law and got to the place at 5:30.  Seated immediately and then waited over 10 minutes for the waiter just to grace us with her presence.  had to go over to the hostess table to ask why our waiter hadn't come by yet when the other two tables at the place had been served (and there were only two other tables).
finally our waiter came.  FYI, her name is Amanda and she doesn't know how to smile.
food was mediocre.  the michigan salad was over-dressed and nothing special.  the trout was bland and the sauces too creamy.  the braised short ribs were okay, but the vegetables weren't seasoned well.  
the atmosphere, menu and food were all trying too hard  and came off as pretentious.  so many more genuine places to eat at in AA, don't bother at this one.
