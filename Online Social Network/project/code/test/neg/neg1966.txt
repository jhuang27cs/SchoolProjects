I had great hopes for this place and my husband and I were excited for a new place to go for happy hour in Westwood.  The decor and overall vibe of the place (minus the attitude of the staff) are totally up our alley.  Unfortunately, each time we have gone to The Glendon we have left feeling frustrated and disappointed.  They have regularly been understaffed and we have had to sit for over half an hour without being able to get the attention of any waitstaff (just to order our drinks!).  

The food has been ok, but often comes out cold.  Initial happy hour was decent but now they have cut the wines that are on happy hour and only have a couple mixed drinks on special.  We were actually told by one of the bartenders that they cut out all the good items on happy hour because they were "losing money" with people buying the better wines on happy hour prices.  

The owner has moments of seeming to be concerned that his customers are dissastified, but more often he is busy flirting with the young co-eds at the bar.  This is particularly unfortunate because while we were looking forward to making the Glendon one of our regular go-to spots in Westwood, but we will be more likely to frequent any of the other restaurants in the area given the awful way we have been treated on numerous occasions.
