Allow me to preface this. I have been around in the service industry in every possible job, bus boy, dishwasher, server, line cook, bartender, delivery driver, expo, FOH / BOH management. My lady and I decided to hit the Crown and Anchor on a Sunday for happy hour beers after we finished with our respective establishments. The entire staff was wasted. We sat at the bar and I could have easily had 3 or 4 more beers but it was like talking to a wall the get the wasted bartender to pay attention. Unprofessional and immature. Sunday Funday is for after work, hope your college crowd tips well because I will never be back.
