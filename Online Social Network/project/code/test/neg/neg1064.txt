I've never been to a show at the middle east, maybe thats why people gave it great reviews. As a place to get a drink before/during/after work, I'd rather find somewhere else. Kinda dirty atmosphere, don't look up, the exposed pipes look like they are gonna fall on you. The middle east is the kind of place where you can spend your hard earned money every day, and still not get recognized when you walk in the door. I've always been fairly anti-middle east, maybe it's because of the rising gas prices? kidding! I just don't find it a good place to hang out, and I don't think the owners are particularly friendly.
