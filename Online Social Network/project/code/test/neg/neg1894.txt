What kind of burrito place sells their chips in bags that look like they would come from a vending machine?

The burrito itself was edible, but slightly below average.

If it were not for the fact that their smoothies and shakes are good, this would have gotten one star from me. Oh, they also take crimson cash, which is nice if you are a student. But smoothies and burritos? What kind of combination is that? Its not really what comes to mind when I think about good fusion in food.
