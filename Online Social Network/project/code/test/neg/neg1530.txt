walters has really bad service. i live in claremont and gave it a chance half dozen times. wont go there anymore. food just okay and they charge alot for little extra things like adding mushrooms or whatever. stopped going due to their attitude about not caring about the customer. so many great restaurants in claremont dont need to go here!
