it's really over-hyped. the food isn't that flavorful.... almost bordering on left-over quality. either oily or dry in all the wrong parts.

their fried chicken is so greasy that it'll hurt your stomach. waffles looked amateur at best and were quite dough-ey. seafood chowder is watery and tasteless. had to add a lot of s&p.... and there are really a ton of places that do better mac n' cheese and ribs in nyc. 

fast food quality at restaurant prices.
