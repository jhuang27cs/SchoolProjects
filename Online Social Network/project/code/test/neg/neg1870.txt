I went in to grab a quick sandwich and salad to go and share with my husband. The panini arrived basically cold and the fresh mixed green salad has saut√©ed vegetables in it--it was also really small for a $7+ salad. To top it off there were no utensils and I didn't realize it until I had left. 
The pastries looked nice so I imagine the number of positive reviews are about the pastries and coffee--skip the cafe menu.
