I have awful problems with my eyes, so going to the eye doctor gives me the nerves that most people get when going to the dentist. I started going to the Harvard location, but switched to Porter when it opened because it's so close to my house. The Harvard location wasn't bad, but Porter is terrible. 

I had to wait an HOUR the time to get seen, and the doctor didn't apologize or even mention the delay. Instead, she rushed through my exam and wouldn't take time to answer my questions fully. She also decided that I should have my eyes dilated, which was frustrating because I could have been doing that for the HOUR I was waiting to be seen. So, I had to come back a week later and the experience was exactly the same. 

I'm changing eye doctors now because eyes are too serious to be left in the hands of an inept doctor.
