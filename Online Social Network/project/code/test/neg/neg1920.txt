Went there on Saturday night. Not sure if that's the best night to go or if some nights are better than others. First, let me just say that for those of you who've heard Dan Cook's opinion of clubs, this applies: Don't go through that door! That's not a bathroom, that's a woofer!"

A little on the crowded side, and the bartenders were not very helpful (they also didn't make good drinks.) I've been a bartender, so I can say this with authority.

The reason this gets two stars instead of one is that I came from the Enormous Room, and anything is better than that.
