Any place that isn't open 24 hours simply cannot be considered a REAL diner. That said, Zoe's is about as close as you can get around Harvard Square (without going to that weird place on JFK). The service is always slow and the bathrooms are filthy, but the food isn't bad. The turkey ruben is tasty and you can't go wrong with eggs, potatoes and toast. Zoe's is an excellent hangover cure.
