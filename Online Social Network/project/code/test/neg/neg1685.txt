This is like an expensive Urban Outfitters meets Pac Sun - wait, those two are already expensive...so think, over priced, way over priced.

Everything is jam packed in the store - it is hard to look through racks, items seem completely out of place and mismatched, there is very little flow in the store, and worst of all...the staff is trying too hard to be edgy and emo that they roll their eyes when you ask for help.

The crappy part is - they have some cute, hard to track down items and they want way to much $ for them and make is difficult to get to them.

I had really hoped for more from this place.  It is capable of being pretty awesome, but as of right now...big disappointment.
