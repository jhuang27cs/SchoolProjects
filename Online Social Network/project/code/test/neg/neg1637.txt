My search for a decent and affordable barber shop in Princeton will go on.  This place is overpriced ($29 for a 10 minute haircut!), the guy has no concept of customer service, and the haircut was pretty mediocre.  No styling at the end, no straight razor on the neck, in fact nothing out of the ordinary.  For 29 bucks, I expect a few extras.  All in all, a ripoff.  Avoid at all costs.
