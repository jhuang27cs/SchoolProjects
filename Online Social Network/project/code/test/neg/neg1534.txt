Hands down one of the worst bars in Boston.  I've been several times for various fundraisers and shows.  Although the shows and fundraisers have been cool, this bar freaking sucks.  I really don't like being pressured into buying a drink at 2 pm on a Sunday at a fundraising event (especially since there was minimal table service).  So I ended up paying 3 bucks for a Diet Coke that I didn't even drink.

The food is mediocre, the bartender is often smarmy and the service is horrible.  I would never go here unless I was attending a performance for one of my friends.  Avoid this place at all costs.
