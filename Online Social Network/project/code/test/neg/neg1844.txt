What a disappointment!  After reading those other reviews, although
rather outdated, we were excited to try this neighborhood Italian for its
pizza and salad.  The waiter didn't know much of anything about the
menu or ingredients, and was annoyed by the prospect of having to
ask the manager-- even though the place was almost empty.  He was 
down right rude, but the manager is lovely.  The salad was not fresh,
and had no flavor, and the dressing too much vinegar.  The real problem was the burned crust pizza.  It may have tasted better had it
not been blackened pizza, but we will never know.  I will say the sausage was quite good.  We  showed  three waiters and the 
manager  that the pizza was inedible due to its burnt  state.  They
shrugged and walked away.  As did we, never to return; we suggest 
you do the same.
