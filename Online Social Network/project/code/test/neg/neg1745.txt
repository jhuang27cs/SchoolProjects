Not that this place needs another review, but here it goes. 

UGH!!! I paid $16 for a SMALL!!! pepperoni pizza. There alone I was a little edgy, but I thought man this is going to be damn good for that price. Well, it was good don't get me wrong, but definitely not worth that price. And the specials they have on their website are not up to date! WACK!
