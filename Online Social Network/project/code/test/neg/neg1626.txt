A slice of pizza that is larger than your head - no joke! My friend took me here before we retired for the night and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the ginormous slices!

We got a slice each and I happily ate it, though it took me a while to finish as I got pretty full near the end. 

This pizza is okay - certainly not a place I'd go out of my way for and definitely not the best, but it will satisfy your hunger.
