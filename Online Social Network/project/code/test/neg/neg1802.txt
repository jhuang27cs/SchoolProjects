Bland sushi and our tuna tasted too fishy/old. The drink prices are good and portions alright but there is better out there and this place has some pretty high price for the mote specialty sushi. Feels authentic but without much craftiness. I like the people, the vibe and the music. The first time I came here I thought the sushi was a lot more tasty but I had also finished with a long job so I could probably pick up more on the flavor since my body was a little dehydrated.

There is a lot on the menu but a lot of the prices are a little higher for the specialty rolls and that's usually what people are going to want to eat. It seems like a place where college kids go to eat because they either don't have a car or are to lazy to take a trip to somewhere farther downtown.

*Dropped this place down to a 2-star after recently discovering actual good sushi elsewhere around town*
