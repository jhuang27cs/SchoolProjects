I'm not a fan of American Apparel.  I think its great that their clothes are American made, but the quality is really poor.  The items that I bought here have NOT held up well at all.  When I tried to return a defective item that I ordered online, the online manager was rude and difficult about it, (and you can't return online stuff to the store!).  Clothing is poor quality and kind of pricey for what it is, returns are difficult, I wouldn't shop here if you can avoid it.  Also, AA should re- think their ads.  I really wanted to like this store, but it just wasn't happening.
