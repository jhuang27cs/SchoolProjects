If you enjoy a little spice in your life, don't go here!  All of the food tasted so bland (comparable to what I would imagine pureed toilet paper's flavor to be) that I had to stop eating my meal even though my stomach was still growling.  There was absolutely no taste in anything on my plate, and I felt as though I was eating merely for survival purposes (surely wasn't eating for enjoyment).  About ten minutes after my order came, the waiter brought my check and asked if I wanted a box...while I was still trying to consume the tasteless mess Bandito's called a "burrito".  Never have I been rushed out of a restaurant like this.  The most shocking part was that nobody else came in to the restaurant the entire time we were there, and the table that was already eating when we arrived was rushed out shortly after we showed up by the wait staff.  Weird, strange, blah.  Don't waste your money.
