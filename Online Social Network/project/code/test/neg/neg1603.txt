I don't understand how this place was ever in the running for "Best Pool Hall in Boston." It either doesn't speak well for Boston or the editors Boston Magazine. I suspect the later.

There are many full-sized tables and the felt and cues are in decent condition. I've noticed warping on several visits though. Not too bad, but noticeable at times. I wouldn't nitpick something like that except for a place being sold as "the Best."

Johnny's is often crowded with their many themed nights and after work parties, which is good in my book, but it can take a bit to get a table. Unfortunately, the food and the bartenders don't do much to mitigate. 

The chicken tenders (my go-to bar food) were inedibley gross. Nachos were a little better. The salsa is from a can, and so is the guacamole, if that's your thing. It got me through the night, but I was not enticed to explore further.

The beer and booze selection is typical. Nothing special. Mixed drinks are fine, but don't dare ask for a double twice. They'll kick you out. Happened to a friend of mine who'd been going for a while. I guess there's rules to dis sh*t. 

By far the worst aspect of this place is the staff. They seem more interested in surliness than service. Waitresses come around ever so often. I've definitely gone 45 mins without seeing mine. The bar is much worse. They will straight up ignore you, given any pretense. 

I've been to much bigger and much better places than this. Flat Top Johnny's, why the attitude? You're a small fish in a big pond. I recommend King's for bowling and pool in the Back Bay. Still MIT adjacent, and a much much cooler atmosphere.

I'll still shoot pool here, but it's not the best.
