It's too expensive.  I'm usually willing to pay more for quality, but only if there's also an option to pay less for lower quality, and here everything's top dollar.  There's no reason to pay that much more for seed beads that you can get online way cheaper.  Plus, while they have nice shiny distracting beads, they lack some essentials, like spools of silk for stringing- they only sell by the yard or on cards, which is much more expensive unless you're only doing a project or two.  They don't seem to cater to people who do a high volume of beading.
