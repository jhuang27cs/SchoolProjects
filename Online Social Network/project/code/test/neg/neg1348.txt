The sushi is pretty horrible, unless you get something like completely deep-fried so you can't taste the quality of fish. I like the al-bap here, but it is an acquired taste. It is a bowl of rice with different types of fish eggs piled on top with a bit of salad, and its served with gochu jang, korean pepper paste. Theirs is pretty good and its reasonably priced, about 10 bucks, so if I am craving for al-bap but don't feel like making the drive all the way to Koreatown, For Tuna it is. Their yook gae jang is ok, its spicy, but not enough to qualify as true yook gae jang to me, so I tell them to make it extra spicy. Its not the best, but when you have a hangover, any port in a storm right? Basically, the food isn't great, they get two stars for helping me save gas instead of treking out to Koreatown.
