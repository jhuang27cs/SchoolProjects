TERRIBLE!!!!  Caused me to my flight!

I was on hold forever then told a cab would pick me up in ten minutes to take me to airport.  

After half hour, I called back and waited on hold again only to be told the cab picked someone else up by accident (which seems unrealistic on my quiet neighborhood street).  

Then they said another cab would come right away and it never showed up so I finally dragged my bags to Harvard square to hail a cab in person, but it was too late.  The HOUR wasted waiting for a cab that never showed cause me to miss my flight back to California.

 Don't waste your time  - call anyone else!
