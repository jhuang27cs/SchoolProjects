Let me start off with a joke. Why did the chicken cross the road? To run into traffic and end his life by getting ran over by a Claremont College hipster's Volvo 240 because a night at Flapper's drove him to commit suicide. I should of known this place is a stinky turd by visiting their website first. My God it looks like it was made in 1998 when you had to manually enter everything in HTML code. It took like 20 minutes for the girl in the front to process a credit card purchase for the tickets then half way through processing she said the machine was broken and pointed us out to an ATM. We finally get in and there's like 6 other people in there. I felt like I was going to watch my six year old sing Yankee Doodle Dandy at her elementary school cafeteria. I think the MC of the show was drunk.. he was holding a beer and sort of slurring his words. The comedy blew. I wonder where they find these comics? Do they ask the guys working the window at Del Taco drive-thru if they want to do stand up? I asked to speak to the manager whom I think was named Dick or Mick. I couldn't really understand him. He was a total anus. I wanted to see if I could get a refund or at least free tickets. He told us to pretty much kick rocks. I will never be back here unless I get totally smashed at the Back Abbey and stumble over here so I can heckle the "comedians".
