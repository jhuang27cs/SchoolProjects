I went in for a simple crew cut. Somehow, they messed it up. The cut was uneven and looked asymmetrical. I'm not very picky, but this is the worst haircut I have ever received. Then, $15! I didn't tip and I got yelled at for my troubles. I have heard similar horror stories from others. You really don't want to go here.
