I have been here hundreds of times, it is literally across the street from my office and over the past 3 years I have dined here more than I count, most often for lunch.

Now, being an ex-bartender, I know that lunch is the time to hustle and it seems that the bartender at Marlow's doesn't get that notion. I guess my complaints are mostly about service. The food is good for the price (and the guy who said he would pay the same at Steel next door is DREAMING!). But since Lauren the bartender left, it has been awful at the bar. 

Last week my salad sat in the expo window for 30 minutes, it had a medium steak on it that is supposed to be served warm, but it was ice cold. I sent it back and thankfully the female manager remedied it quickly. This week, I came in and was the first/only bar guest. I ask to change one of the channels from golf (since both were on golf, and I was the only one sitting there) yet the manager essentially told me no "Guys will be coming in to watch golf". I could not believe he would say NO to a) a customer, and b) considering I was the only person at the bar and 6 other TV's in the rest. had golf on. 

Either way, when I paid the bill, the bartender spilled my water all over me. Thankfully he did apologize. The younger male manager came over with a towel, handed it to me and walked away, while the bartender cleaned the bar and went about his business. Meanwhile I stand there soaked and with a puddle of water below the bar stools. I WAS THE ONE who put the towels on the floor in hopes that the next customer wouldn't bust their ass. 

I adore Antoine as my bartender, and from now on will only sit at the bar if he is there... otherise I will probably go somewhere else..... Being an ex-bartender, I am very understanding, but certainly expect better service....
