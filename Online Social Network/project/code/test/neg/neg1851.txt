Two and a half stars overall.  Host=negative one star. Outright rude.  Service=3 stars.  Friendly but slow.  Food=3 stars.  Straight ahead sports bar food.  Atmosphere=2 stars.  Standard sports bars, TVs well-placed, but very very noisy.  Location is great if you live in Southern Village because you can walk.  Otherwise better options in downtown Carrboro (Tylers, Southern Rail, Milltown) or Chapel Hill.
