Came in here late one evening, mainly because I was near by and hungry. I'd heard good things about this place from some people I know, so I figured it was worth a shot. It looks like your typical strip mall Chinese joint, a little dingy with next to no dining area. It was pretty busy, and probably a little dirtier than normal because of that. After getting the food, I was not impressed. The food tasted a little freezer burnt and the imitation crab had a very odd taste. With so many better options in the area I won't be going there again.
