The worst jamba juice I've ever tasted... Had a First Aid Certification in Ackerman. Stopped by to get Banana Berry and Acai smoothie. Both tasted super bland. There was no flavor. It tasted like water slushie literally....

I'm not sure if all Jamba Juices taste like this now since I haven't been to one in a year but I would not come back here...
