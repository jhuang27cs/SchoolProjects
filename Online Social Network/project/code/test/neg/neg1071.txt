If you're a guy then I recommend going the extra distance to the Neiman Marcus store in San Francisco. This one at the Stanford mall is primarily aimed towards female customers. The women's collection takes up the entire 2nd floor and more than half of the 1st. They crammed the men's section into a little corner on the 1st floor where you'll be lucky to find what you're looking for. What's worse is that this store doesn't even stock most of the product line that's on the Neiman Marcus website. Shopping here felt like I was in an outlet store.
