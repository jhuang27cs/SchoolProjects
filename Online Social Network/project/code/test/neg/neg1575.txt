If you want decent food and good service then don't come here!!  Food was awful.  Got a little burger with "soft chips" which is basically undercooked sliced potatoes...gross & greasy and they charge you an extra 1.95 to undercook them, but advertise them as something special.  They had ran out of practically half the items on the menu and had none of the beers on hand that we wanted to order...and this was at 5:30 pm on a Sat....not like we showed up at 10 pm.  Seems like the owner is setting this place up to fail and squeeze every last dime out of customers.  Will NOT be returning!!!!
