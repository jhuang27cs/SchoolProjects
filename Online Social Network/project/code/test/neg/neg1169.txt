Extremely bland food, high prices even for PA, and very small portions - overall just terrible!  We came for lunch today.    I had the burrito special with pollo asado, spanish rice, refried beans, and cheese ($7).   This also includes chips, salsa and a drink and is by far the best deal in the restaurant.  I wanted to add guac to it but it is pre-made and they cant add to it.   They offered to sell me a tiny container of guac for $4...um, no thanks.   The chips were a microscopic portion (less than 10 small chips) and were hard and dry.   Burrito was edible but nothing to write home about.   Almost no cheese, rice was bland, refried beans were bland and tasted frozen/reheated, chicken was bland and had no seasoning...do you detect a theme?    The burrito was also on the small side.   My fiance had the chimichangas, which he paid around $9 for, and they were the size of eggrolls.   I have no idea how 2 eggrolls are supposed to constitute a lunch.   He had to eat a second lunch elsewhere.   I "had to" (wink, wink) go next door and eat a Kara's cupcake.  

This is probably the worst Mexican food I've had so far in California, or for that matter ever.   I am ok with inauthentic Mexican, but this was ridiculous - I can make much better Mexican food at home and I am far from an expert on this kind of cooking. On top of that, prices are very high and portions are microscopic, especially the chimichangas.   (I am genuinely confused as to why so many people on Yelp say the portions are large - I am that person that normally brings half my food home and I could not believe how small the portions were here.  Maybe they've changed?)   There is also nowhere to sit in the restaurant, so its take-out only, which is normally not a big deal but it means their prices should be lower.   On top of everything else, my stomach did not feel well for the rest of the afternoon after eating here. I will not come back.
