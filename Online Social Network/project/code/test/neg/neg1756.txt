This is not a diner. This is a family restaurant that you just don't want to bring your family.

I have never, nor will I ever  go to the new location. I don't frequent ex-Chinese buffets, even if they're in their afterlife. I used to go to the old Philly Diner because the coffee was decent and the wall of windows was good. It was bright, the music was terrible, and they made an okay burger.

Over the years I learned that the food is pretty bad. All the meat comes pre-stamped, as in freezer-block city. The french fries are terrible (the onion rings are okay). The food here was just pretty comparable to Denny's. I did always like the service, which never lasted long. Still... as this are continues to get more franchised, even my independent-business-loving self sees little purpose in accepting mediocrity.
