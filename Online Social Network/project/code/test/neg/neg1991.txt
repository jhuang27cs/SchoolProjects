I was curious about buying a Fiat and contacted this dealership in January. Since then, I have been repeatedly called and emailed by this dealership.

I responded to their latest email this morning to demand permanent removal from their contact list. Here is the response I received from Ron P:

"Please reference the opt-out link at the bottom of this email, sorry if offering my services hurt your feelings."

Really says it all, doesn't it?
