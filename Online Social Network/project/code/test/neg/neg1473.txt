The prices are low, but it's not worth it.  This place constantly spews a cloud of greasy smoke over the Ave and if that's not a fair warning, let this be. 

The service and burgers are mediocre. The atmosphere is non-existent.   The seating seems cramped.  No reason to go here when you can go to A Burger Place for a dollar more.
