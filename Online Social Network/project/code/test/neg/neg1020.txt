bread and olive oil was decent. food was average but the worst is the service.

The server served our starters but forgot to give us our cutlery. We spent the next ten minutes trying to get her attention. And when we did (when she was finally serving our mains), she just went "oh" and sauntered away slowly. Then we found out she got our mains mixed up, sauce or shrimp, and she went,"can u eat it like this?" we were so mad.

oh, and when we asked another server to fill our glasses because we could never get our server's attention, the other server told us, we have to ask our server to get it.

Bertucci's has confirmed to me my fear of chain restaurants. This was such a horrible experience.
