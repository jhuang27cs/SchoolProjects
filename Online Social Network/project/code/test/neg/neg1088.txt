We had the:
1. full rack of ribs.  Not very soft. The ends were especially dry and tough.
2. lamb burger.  Don't order it.  It's a mistake to order lamb burger at this place.  It was dry and tasted gamey.
3. trio mushroom pasta.   Maybe one of the better things we ordered but still, it's not good for pasta standard.  No, this place is not for pasta.
4. french onion soup.  Just ok.  Nothing special.
5. chocolate mocha mousse cake.  It looks better than it tastes. 
Disappointing.

*Oh, the fries were overcooked and dry.  So try to sub it with baked potatoes.  They did not give us such an option but you should ask anyway.

We decided to come to this place because it has been a long time since we went to the one in the city.  So decided to give this place a try and see how things are.  But how disappointing!!  It got crowded after we got seated at 6:45pm on Saturday.  The interior decor is nice but the place is kind of loud and noisy.  The food is under par for me.  Only one waitress sang the whole time we were there.  The rest of the time, the singing was performed by the pianist which could hardly be heard.  The portion of the food is big but kind of pointless if it's not good.  :-(  

No plan to go back and that's just too sad as it used to be a fun place to go.
