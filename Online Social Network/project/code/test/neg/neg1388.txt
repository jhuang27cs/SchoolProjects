It's okay... I had a really bad impression last time with their lunch special--basically leftovers from the night before. Pad Thai noodles were all soggy, the chicken was dry, grease started coagulating at the bottom of the container... gross stuff...

This time, they improved a little. At least the green curry and cashew chicken was pre-made on the same day, yet I don't understand why that lady at the cashier had to be so mean.. raised her voice and yelled at me with saliva shooting at my face: "so you want num-ba won and two no fore YES? NUM-BA WAT? OK! two and fore! Now pay."
