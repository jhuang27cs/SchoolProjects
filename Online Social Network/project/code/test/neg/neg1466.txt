I honestly think there is only room for one Vortex in Atlanta and it's not this one. 

This location has the same great food as the location in L5P but everything else is sub-par.  I took some visiting family into this location for a lunch after exploring midtown and was not impressed with the service.  There where five tables seated in the entire place and three servers on, it was far from busy but it took forever to place our orders, nearly forty minutes to get our food, in fact one of my guests managed to start snoozing at the table it was taking so long. 

Our particular server was so poor that I had to get up and find silverware because he neglected to bring it to the table and none of the other servers could be found on the floor. 

Piss poor service, none of the fun atmosphere of the L5P location just wasn't thrilled. 

I'll stick to the L5P location from now on.
