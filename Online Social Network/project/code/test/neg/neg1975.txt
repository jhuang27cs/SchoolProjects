I'm writing a two-star review of a Harvard grad school - that's right, you heard me, two stars!  Not five, or even four!  T-w-o.

A place with this many egos and agendas in one place is a hotbed for Good People Behaving Badly.  What I mean by that is that these people who can't see past the tip of their own nose and are, collectively, quite entitled and snobby, really aren't baadd people.  In one-on-one settings, I might even like them.  I might applaud their intelligence, or their drive, or whatever else they have.  But as a group?  Forget it.
