Apparently this is a bar that does NOT like to get people drunk. I've been there twice for the mini pool table and both times got "cut off" with a couple of my buddies after only 2 rounds of shots. Everyone that works there looks at you like they don't want you to be there and they just want to go home for the night. DON"T GO HERE! Save yourself the shitty time and go across the street to Blakes.
