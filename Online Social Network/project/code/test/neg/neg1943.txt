The Asgard does seem out of place for being fake-Irish/fake-Nordic next to all the original bars in Central Square.  

Like:
Trivia night on Tuesdays with Jill
Turkey burger with avocado and gouda
Lots of capacity (except it's hard to get a table during trivia night)

Neutral Opinion:
Beer list--you can't go wrong with Harpoon IPA or Guinness, but the rest are so-so.

Dislike:
Boring atmosphere.  I had enough of this in D.C. and Virginia (Molly Malone's [now O'Sullivan's], Ri Ra, Kitty O'Shea's, Four Courts, Four P's...)
