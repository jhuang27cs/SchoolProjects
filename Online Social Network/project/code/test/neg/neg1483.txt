This place is okay for game day but they were Ã¼ber rude last time we're here.  They have a weird system when they are busy (which I am not convinced happens often) and the manager basically told us we were to wait on the street.   Lots of people left in disgust.  Once we were finally seated (30 plus minutes later)  We noticed there were tons of spaces available, that tables jus weren't being bussed quickly.  Really really irritating.  They have great appetizers here but I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble.
