Please do not waste your time at this ridiculous place that should be ashamed to call themselves chocolate lovers. I bought a groupon for a four course tasting dinner that was valued at $98....i payed $48 for it, and still overpayed aout $40 for what we actually got.  The groupon indicated we would receive a 4- course meal for two with 2 "virgin chocktails", 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts, as well as a chocolate tasting and a cooking demonstration. When my sister and i arrived we walked into a tiny room with small metal tables and metal chairs. No one offered us water or drinks. It was byob, but we sat for 20 minutes before realizing if we wanted to actually drink the wine we brought, we had to get up and get our own tiny plastic cups. They were actually out next to a disgusting drink made of tomato juice and carrot juice mixed together. Then a woman came out and bored us to death with a "lesson" on chocolate. Then, she reviewed the menu...and im starving by this point, so im excited! Fail. She tells us about soup and salad, and then a shrimp dish and a chicken and rice dish. Cool, but why is she holding out on telling us about the appys? Maybe someone will come out with a nice tray withy three appys on it.  Wait, what? I have to walk up to the counter for my salad? Appetizers come before salad! Needless to say, there was no appys. And the salas was on paper plates, as was the rest of the food, and it was literally three leaves of lettuce and half a grape tomato.  Soup wss watery, and could have fit in a dixie cup. The chocolate tasting was three discs of chocolate the size of a nickel, and dessert was oranges, pineapple, and a teaspoon of ganache. We then had to go around the room and introduce ourselves and tell our favorite travel story. My favorite travel story was the time i left the chocolate lovers club in princeton and drove to taco bell...because i was still starving.
