I'm sorry guys, really, I understand every place has to have something they can boast and call their own, but with all of the hype, I was beyond greatly disappointed in the food. Soggy as a rain drenched rat and as tasteless as one of the Kardashians. I am all for a good corned beef sandwich, when I find one, but not here. Seriously, save you time and energy fighting with a crowd and go to Sammy's instead. At least you can taste the meat on their sandwiches. The single star isn't to be spiteful, but for the shattered expectations.
