Gringo mex. Bland and expensive for what it is. Burritos I've had there have been not only cold (the torilla not warmed enough and cold beans/rice in the middle) but wet from lettuce and tomatoes. Flavorless beans. Poor service, untrained cooks who do not give a damn. Good margaritas at happy hour, i'll give it that. Do not bother. Ithaca awaits an authentic taqueria or taco truck.
