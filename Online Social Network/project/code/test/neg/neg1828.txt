I feel like I'm missing something because clearly Sweet is doing well enough to open up a few more stores.  I had a cupcake from their first store on Mass Ave not too long after they opened.  And it was a seriously dry, stale cupcake.  I gave up on them after that, but new stores kept popping up all over Boston.  I don't get it.  Come on, people of Boston.  I know we always get the food trends like 5 years after New York and LA, but we don't have to settle for dry cupcakes!
