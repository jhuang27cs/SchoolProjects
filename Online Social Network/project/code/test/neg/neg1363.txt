I was expecting much more from this place. Sure the decor was cool and trendy, but the experience overall was a bust. The waitstaff was very inattentive and our meals took a long time to get to the table. Neither my boyfriend or I really liked our meals. Paying $10 for a bowl of flavorless broth and essentially Maruchan noodles with fatty pork? Not my idea of a good meal. Not going back.
