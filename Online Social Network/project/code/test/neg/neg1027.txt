Do NOT sit outside in the late afternoon. We were seated at 6:30pm (in May), and the sun was directly in my eyes. They will not let you move your chair because then the servers don't have room to walk within the boundaries of the restaurant. I thought it especially odd that they wouldn't let us move tables--we were told we could go up to the hostess and put our names at the bottom of the list if we wanted to be reseated. We had already waited an hour for our table.

The food was fine, the service was a little surly and slow, but the patio was awful. I don't mind waiting a long time for a great experience, but the time we waited was completely not proportional to what we got.
