Nice ambiance, nice presentation but that's about it. 

I came here for my birthday dinner on recommendations from a friend and was pretty disappointed. We started off with the combo appetizer plate it came with potato spinach fried turn over thing, a meat empanada type dish, dolmas and hummus & a spin off of babaganoush (sp?). Everything was extremely greasy and the meat tasted dirty.. The hummus also had a weird flavor, kind of like the skin of a jalape√±o.  My dad ordered a steak "extra rare" and it came out extra well done. They sent it back and it came out rare but it was about half the size of the original steak, which says a lot when you know steak REALLY shrinks when you cook it that much. My mom ordered the tandoori chicken breast pizza. It comes and it's mostly dark meat. She asks the waiter and he asks the cook who comes out to talk to us and explain it's a typo on the menu and it means they "skinned the meat off the bone," not that it was boneless skinless breast as it says on the menu! As for me, I ordered the shrimp tandoori. It claimed it came with shrimp, grilled peppers and mushrooms and a bed of rice. The presentation was pretty, but there was a grand total of three 1 inch square pieces of bell pepper. The mushrooms and rice were good as was the grilled tomato, but the shrimp, which should have been the star of the show, was WAY over cooked and was tough and rubbery. The lack of vegetables was also a bummer. Overall, when every dish costs $24 it should be a he'll of a lot better than it came out. 

In the end they comped us for dessert and were polite about everything, hence the two stars, but the quality of the food was trash and the numerous screw ups in the kitchen is sad. I definitely wouldn't recommend Walter's and I don't plan to return.
