We went in for soft serve.  Saw a huge sign inside that said "24 flavors of soft serve."  We figured we'd get soft serve.  

We were wrong.

We were told soft serve would not be available for two more weeks.  Fine, but take the sign down until that time.  Don't care for false advertising.

Will re-review upon return.
