I'm over Judie's. It's an upscale version of Applebee's with galumphingly large portions and awful prices for the quality of food one receives. It's as overstimulating as a Chuck E. Cheese and about as appealing as eating at one. The menu is downright Tolstoyesque, roughly eighty pages of the same rehashed food. Even the popovers seem mass-produced at this rate. If you must go, go to get drunk. At least their sangria is fairly decent.
