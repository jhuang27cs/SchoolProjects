Acapulco's has decent food, can accommadate large parties but i have one major recurring problem with this venue: they cannot ever get the bill correct! 

Granted, both times i went I went with a party of 20 and 40,  Always had problems with the bill--charges for items we didnt receive (perhaps ordered but didnt receive) and charges for misc drinks.. whats going on!? both times i had to get my bill ammended for 50 dollar over charges. The manager usually brought them down 30 dollars and we paid it.. Annoying. I mean i know its a large party but they should be able to handle it--duh, use seperate bills or something? 

Anyway i think  there food is a bit overpriced for being standard mexican food, but okay for groups.
