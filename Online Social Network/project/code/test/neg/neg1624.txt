If this were the only Greek restaurant in the city, I'd probably feel differently about the meal I had here.

However, a quick Yelp for "greek food" proves that this is not the case. Wish I'd done one before picking this place.

Highly mediocre. "Mostly okay" and "meh" come to mind. The thing is, food that is just "not terrible," does not make this a place to go, ever. In fact, food this "okay," food that gives the impression that nobody ever cared much about it, equals disappointment. 

The gyros meat was the same industrial frozen stuff you'd get at a Cash N Carry. That's fine at a food court, where you're getting change from a $10 for your meal. Munching the floppy little strips, I was acutely aware that I was seated within pitching distance of incredible (though admittedly not Greek) gyros on the Ave.

I will say that the avgolemono was tasty, rich and thick. 

The roast lamb was not very tender, mostly bland. Served with blah potatoes and whatever vegetables. The most I could say for this, is that there was a decent amount of meat on the plate, and a salt shaker handy.

There are too many other options for this kind of underachieving to work. 

In this price range, you can easily get a great sit-down meal in Seattle. Eating here left me with the feeling that I missed an opportunity to eat somewhere else.
