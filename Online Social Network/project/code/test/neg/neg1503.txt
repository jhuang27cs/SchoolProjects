What a sack of crap bar. If you want to ruin a good night. GO HERE. 

The first time I went to this bar, I had a reasonable time. I mean, there was music and a lot of people. So, it was alright for being unbearably loud and far too crowded. But... this last time, will definitely be my last time. 

First off. This happened the first time I went here, but kind of brushed it off that time. The bouncers are douche bags. Straight up thinking they are the gate keepers of heaven. Three bouncers were talking, off on the side in a circle. So, we went next to them to the other bouncers (to be polite) and they were like "Hey hey hey, I'm going to need to see some ID." Besides being ass bags about it, I didn't mind to much... I'm pretty easy going. 

Now, for what really got me pissed. We sat around for some time deciding what we should drink. Then we ordered. However, there was four of us and three chairs. My friend, knowing that we were going to be there a while now went to go get a chair. Five minutes later, he came back. Only to tell us, he had a hard time about it. He saw a group of four with six other empty chairs around their table. He asked if he could have one. They said "they are going to be used fairly soon." There was an extra one in the corner by itself and my friend grabbed that one. 

Then, maybe ten minutes later a waitress comes over with a bouncer. And she says to my friend how he took this chair from a group on the other side of the bar. He explained how the chair was by itself and our table only had three chairs. And I could not believe what she said next. She says "Well, this is not my section." And the bouncer comes closer. So yeah, he gave it up and we left after we finished our drinks.

Bottom line: costumer service sucks. And to top it off. There is a ton of 40 year old dudes just there to hit on college chicks. 

Thank god I didn't go here for New Years.
