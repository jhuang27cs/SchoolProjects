I was seriously disappointed here.  I tried 6 cupcakes today from Sweet.  The Boston Cream cupcake - just don't even try it, the consistency is weird, the filling is lumpy and the chocolate top layer was weird in a way I couldn't explain...   The vanilla and cappuccino were dry.  The carrot cake was good, the chocolate ok, the red velvet was very moist, but the flavor was lacking and overpowered by the overly sweet frosting.  The best part of this shop is probably the location and carrot cupcake, I won't be back based on 5 out of 6 cupcakes I have sampled.
