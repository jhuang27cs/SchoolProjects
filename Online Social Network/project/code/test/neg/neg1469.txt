Cheapo Discs in Central Square has a lot going against it.  For one thing, it's the most expensive place in town.  Discs average $12-13 each, noticeably more than they do in every other place in Cambridge.  For another, I can't figure out if they merged with Skippy White's or what, but I had this terrible experience with Skippy White's once where they sold me an empty CD case and then I had to argue with some dude for like ten minutes to get my money back.  Seriously.  Skippy White's sign is now outside Cheapo's, along with Cheapo's sign, and I don't know what that's supposed to mean but I feel conflicted.

Anyway, the selection turns out to be pretty good, although the hip-hop area is negligible.  But the dudes behind the counter are still kinda dicks.  And my wife - you know how cats can sense ghosts?  My wife is like that.  Including the part where cats can't actually sense ghosts, they're just crazy sometimes.  My wife felt so crazy about Cheapo that she just took off after a few minutes.  Met me outside.  And this is a woman who's usually cool with me spending 45 minutes going through the quarter bin at some dude's yard sale.  I don't care whether it's ghosts or the greasy guys behind the counter: if my wife gets skeeved that fast at any place, I'm either gonna take off or tell your mom to put her pants back on.

I BOUGHT: The D.O.C., "No One Does it Better" ($13).  The D.O.C. was a member of the NWA family who released one album and then got into a car accident that severed his vocal cords.  To Death Row's credit, the dude is still hanging around in like every video those guys make.  They took care of him.  And this album's pretty good.  I was psyched to find it.
