When I first found Lee Lin i thought their food was amazing, but I think it was really was just because it wasn't as horrible as most other chinese places. After having some real chinese food, I still think the food is ok, (for delivery at least). I like the sesame chicken has a real sesame taste to it, and that you can order mild, medium, hot, etc. 

The problem I have and was reminded of it tonight is the insanely inconsistent delivery. At first there would be times they would come in 15 minutes and I didn't even know how they could have cooked the food that fast. I would give solid tips, i am always a real solid tipper, i would tip 10 bucks on a 30 dollar bill if it came in 15 minutes.

The last 2 times i have ordered the food has taken 1.5 hours to 2 hours to arrive and i have had to call both times. Today I called 1.5 hours after ordering and was told the driver had just left. After I had given specific directions for the driver he still had to call. 

I feel bad for the driver, I know it probably wasnt his fault. But I want to send a message so I tipped nothing, and told him, "I had a better tip for you 2 hours ago sorry".

So if you guys ever do happen to read this, if your driver is coming back pissed off that he got no tip, or  you consistently are getting so busy that you cant deliver food within 2 hours, then it is time for you to shell out some cash and get an extra driver.  

Or at least have the experience to tell us it is going to be a while, or call us back. Don't tell me it is going to be a half hour and set my expectations high by being good some times and then be the complete opposite the next time.
