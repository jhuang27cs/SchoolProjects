The highlights are awful, the worst I've ever gotten. I specifically asked for natural looking highlights and ones that wouldn't look weird growing out. Well, they look too light for my brown hair, streaky, not natural at all. I can already tell you what they will look like growing out because the stylist didn't even go to my roots - yes, it looks like I got this done months ago and need a touch up already. ALSO there is a spot on the top of my head that has a vertical stripe running across it, where is it even lighter than the rest of the highlights! It looks like an amateur did it, except the cost was not amateur cost. What really gets me is when I called back to talk about it with the salon, they were completely unapologetic and said I could come in and pay for more services to be done to try to fix the problem. No way. I will never return. I've gotten highlights done so many times and this is hands down my worst experience. I HATE MY HAIR NOW. Thanks, Sybil Salon for the shittiest hair experience of my life.
