Stella's is like that guy you half-heartedly dated for a while in college...the best thing you can say about him is that he's just a nice guy. Some redeeming qualities, yes, but in the end, you wish you hadn't wasted your time and would have called up someone a little better. Stella's is like that--great for drinks and atmosphere, but not worth the full commitment of dinner. It's grossly overpriced for what reminds me of the food in the Wegmans cafe area. 

If you are just going there for drinks during the week, make sure you go during happy hour, when every second drink is half-priced. They also usually have a nightly drink special for maybe a smidge less than what the other specialty cocktails cost. And they have an extensive wine and whiskey menu, which are two of my greatest weaknesses in life.

But please. Unless you are stuck in Collegetown, there are so many other places in Ithaca that are better than Stella's for drinks and/or dinner.
