Went here fiending for a cheeseburger...should have known, based on the mediterranean food options, that ground beef would not be ZuZu's specialty.

Our burgers were BJ's style revived-from-frozen patties sans melted cheese. The fries, to their credit, weren't bad.

The beer selection was interesting, and I was able to score a Brooklyn lager, making the this venture not a complete loss. The total cost of $25.00 for two beers and two entrees helped with this feeling as well.

The belly dancer and live music were kind of loud for my taste, but, meh. 
They do mix strong drinks and provide a good landing spot before heading to a show at the Middle East.
