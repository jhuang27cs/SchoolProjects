Two Lunches

1) Chicken salad sandwich: 30% chicken, 70% bread. Bland. Thin mayonnaise (?) dripping out. Nice chewy french bread though.

2) Another day, "Smoked Turkey" sandwich. Obvious "lunch meat," not real turkey: no flavor, no texture, thinly sliced, mildly revolting. Included red onion slices that had been sitting too long, and were promptly removed by me, but had a lingering presence. A LOT  of pretty good whole wheat bread surrounding a very sad interior. VERY sad. With iced tea, $12 something. Waste.

Two experiences after years of an occasional cookie or baguette. This really makes me want to avoid the highly-touted new dinners they're having!
