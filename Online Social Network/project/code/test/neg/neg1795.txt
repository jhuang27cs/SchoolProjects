We have been customers for many years and ever since Scott took over, I think being a sharehold went to his head. He is a horrible manager in every since! He is cheap on his supplies (napkins, to-go boxes, etc.), rude to his customers, and Hitler to his staff! After over 10 years of doing business with them he will no longer have mine. I am spreading the word to all my old work places (UCSD La Jolla Playhouse, places in UTC, etc) there that use to use them as a food option. Brittney and some of your other talented staff are the only ones keeping Scott's customer's happy. Trust me, my complant is not done here. My review will be heard... even by the chain's corporate...oh and the other shareholders...oh the possiblities... It's all about the customer experience that makes or breaks a business... hopefully you'll pull your head out of you-know-where and actually be a servant leader to your staff and customers. I would hate to see where you got your business management degree (if you did) and didn't retain that!
