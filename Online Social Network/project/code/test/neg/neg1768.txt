Sak's is mediocre Japanese comfort food.  

The teriyaki sauce is great.... but it's charred a lot of the time.  This might be why I used to smell smoke coming from it from across the street where I used to work.

The fried rice that comes with the dishes is great.... but the veggies are rock hard.  Clearly they're from supermarket bags of frozen vegatables.

It's good for a quick bite, but VERY hit and miss.  I hit Gushi far more often than Sak's when I wanted something quick and Asian, and that was at the expense of walking a few extra blocks each way.
