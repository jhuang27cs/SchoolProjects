Ugh... okay.. so -- a year ago they shrink my coat.  Then I write a review.. the owner gets back with me - apologize, apologize, explain, explain. I've been back a couple of other times and they have been rude.  Oh - wait.. no.. not everyone, the young girls have been very nice.  But I've been stuck with an older lady at the counter (I think the manager) who has never been nice.   

Frankly I'm lazy and live close.  So I decide to give them another try this week.  UGH!! UGH ~ Did you get that?  "She" is at the counter, so I hold my breath anyway.. and maybe some of this is my preconceptions, but I needed some cleaning and she says that they are 'swamped' and starts talking to herself out of thin air.. just having a conversation one slow word at a time and completely ignores me.  Right in front of my face.  

She turns around and I notice that shes on an ear-piece phone (I don't even walk up to counters as a customer while I'm on the phone).  No 'excuse me' or 'let me finish' Nada.  So I ask "when" can I have my items cleaned and she says "I told you we're swamped and I don't know" and with a snippy, leave-me-alone "Dorothy" from the Golden Girls attitude.  WTF! So I take my clothes with me out the door with no notice from her, as she remains on the phone.  

Really?  Really?  I would rather jump in a tub of toxic chemicals than walk back through that door.  I'm done trying - don't bother to write me owner.
