I personally don't think Lamonica's has any business calling its pizza "New York style." It's a bit on the bland side and the slices are definitely smaller than you would expect from a real New York joint.

I've always commented that you can tell it's not real New York pizza because the New Yorkers in the subway mural are all smiling...inaccurate!
