This place is a joke! It seems like most people have had similar experiences at Dental Plus. The first time I went in they said I had 2 cavities and advanced stage gum disease, which I obviously did not less than a year back. They offered a slew of treatments with my portion being $5000 after insurance!!! I agreed to a deep clean which cost more than I had ever paid because I figured that I at least needed that. After the clean, they schedule an appointment one month later with a periodontist who determines that I need $18,000 worth of treatment!!! They even have an African American dentist come in to explain the treatment thinking that I would be more trusting of my own race!!! This guys should be ashamed of themselves. I tell the treatment counselor that they've got to be kidding and we part ways.
