ok so i love chipotle.  if i'm ever hungry, and i see one, it's high on my consideration list.  it's a great value, the ingredients are good, for the most part they're all pretty consistent, and the decorum always feels familiar.  i just like it.  and you know what, up to this point, i haven't really written any reviews for chipotle at all, so it's kind of sad for me to be writing my first one with such a negative review.

i feel that the staff does not do a very good job building burritos.  they are often in a rush (or so they seem) and don't seem interested in building a good burrito at all.  only once did i feel like they adequately filled my burrito to what i have come to expect as standard.  usually they skim on the ingredients and one can only remind them to fill it so many times.  call me a snob, i don't care, but i have contributed so much $$$ to the chipotle franchise that i feel like i have the right to bitch about this one.  =)
