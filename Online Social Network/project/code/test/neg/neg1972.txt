No wonder I blacked this place out even though I've gone so many moons ago with some Penn acquaintances. Those Big Azz Margaritas really can freeze up a memory. But unfortunately they weren't capable of blacking out the horrid experiences that were already documented in Emily's update, and that my review is about to reveal.

After Popped I went down with Emily and the Girls About Town and our hunger level was cranked to 11. Unfortunately we were nowhere near prepared for the clusterfuck that we were about to enter! to vouch for Emily's update we definitely waited close to 2 hours for our food, and some of the orders were properly mixed up. things that were supposed to be plain were seasoned, and things that were supposed to be seasoned and saucy were pretty regular. My quesildilas were pretty good, but cooking shrimp, mushrooms, and spinach isn't rocket science. I definitely recommend keeping your orders kind of simple when going here.

To their credit our server was pretty sympathetic when he had to be the purveyor of bad news (although he could have let us know the short staffed kitchen situation beforehand). And the manager was more than accommodating by giving us half off our entire order and not charging us for the food that was wrong. and they had a cumbersome night that involved short staffed kitchens, overflowing bathrooms, and people coming in from Popped Fest. I'll probably be back because those Margarita's sure are addicting, and as far as I know it's the only spot to get decent ones in West Philly. But It's definitely going to take awhile for me to try dining there again.
