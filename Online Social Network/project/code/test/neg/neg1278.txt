My trip to Tiffin was a real disappointment. I had read many glowing reviews, both here and on Chowhounds, but the actual meals my date and I received made me wonder if everyone else is reviewing a different place entirely. It may be that the reviewers here don't have much experience with Indian food, or perhaps I just caught Tiffin on a really bad night. Regardless, it was a huge letdown. The appetizers we're incredibly dry and tasteless, and the malai kofta tasted nothing like it should. The chicken dishes were OK, but both were more bland than they should have been. The garlic naan was the only standout -- if that's all you're eating, it would be worth the trip. The decor also leaves a lot to be desired. Picture a slighly dressed-up college cafeteria and you're not far off. 

The lunch buffet may be better, but I would not return for dinner. You can definitely find much better North Indian food in the area for the same price or less.
