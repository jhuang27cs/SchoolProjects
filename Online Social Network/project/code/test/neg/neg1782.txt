The decision of Carrie's owner, to encourage the painting of degrading racial caricatures of African-Americans on her store walls this past week has only reaffirmed my feeling that this place is both unwelcoming and attempts to dialog are in bad faith.  While the protests did surrounding the mural did lead to the owner ordering it repainted, I am still deeply hurt and upset that such imagery was even considered allowable, particularly when combined with the store's willingness to sell racist memorabilia, like the Mammy Doll.

I am greatly angered by and disappointed in this place.
