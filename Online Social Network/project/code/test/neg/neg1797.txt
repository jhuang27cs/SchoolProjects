We just stopped in for drinks on a Friday night.  Being from out of town, it wasn't obvious there were two entrances - one for the show, one for the restaurant/bar.  If you're just having drinks/food - make sure you go into the right entrance ;-)

I have to say, I didn't love it - though the waitstaff was friendly, and efficient (even though they once brought me vodka/soda, instead of vodka/tonic - but who complains about that really?). 

I recommend sitting in the back if you'd like to hear the show, but don't want to pay the cover.  You'll hear the music, and still be able to get a little food.  

Bathrooms are downstairs (where the show is), which I thought a bit weird since they want a cover for the show.  Then I realized there's a bathroom-bouncer that won't let you do anything but hit the can and walk back upstairs.

Overall, not bad - I'm sure the music scene/nightclub is probably fun though - it was packed.
