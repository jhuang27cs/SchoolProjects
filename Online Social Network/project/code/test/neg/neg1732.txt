Cover Charge FAIL.

I have gone to this place a few times before and it was an OK bar...nothing really that special about it other than being yet another bar in the Rice Village and the only reason why I was there this weekend was because it was on our "list" for the themed night out we had planned.  Still, I was pretty shocked that they had a $2 cover charge.


I know what you're thinking: "$2 is nothing you cheap bastard", but this time it's really more the principle than anything.   A cover charge was something I paid when I was 19 and would go to a "real club" because the club knew that I couldn't make money off me for drinks so they had to recoup the money for the DJ, lights, rent etc.  

Brian O'Neill's however is just a freaking bar - one of many.  They're already charging $8 drinks and it just shows a lack of class to try to nickle and dime the customers when they offer nothing more in return.   Baker Streets, Ginger Man's, Little Woodrows, Bronx Bar, or hell - any of the places on Washington or Mid-Town or Downtown (not unless there is a feature show) don't charge a cover so to me that either says that Brian O'Neill's either has no class and not respect for their customers, or their target cliente are a bunch of dead-beats.  

Either way - Sorry guys.  That was the last time I will go to your place by my own will at least.

Our waitress WAS cool but as mentioned I'm not a fan of the establishment.  

pfft. cover charge.
