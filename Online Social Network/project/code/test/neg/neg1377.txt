I went here because of the solid reviews on Yelp. I left feeling... chipped.

I was meeting a friend in the U-District for dinner, so I decided to treat myself to a pedi first. Reading the reviews on here, I called ahead to make sure it was quiet, and bounced right in. 

There are a few things I look for a nail salon. Number one: cleanliness. Before I sat down to my pedi, I asked to use the bathroom. The sink had mold surrounding the edges, and the overall bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the days of Salon Selectives (hello 80's). I shrugged it off and sat down to be treated, also noticing that the little sanitizing microwave-thing (to get the bacteria off the nail tools) was tucked away in a corner and blocked by stuff, signaling it probably never gets used. Sigh.

My nail tech was super nice and really attentive (hence, two stars). Beyond that, though, I left disappointed. When she was finished, she asked me to follow her to the drying station - across the room - but didn't offer up slipper, sandals, or even pieces of paper! Um, lady... I just paid you ~$20 to clean my feet, and now you want me to walk across your entire salon - barefoot?! I was... mortified.

The finishing touch was waiting for my nails to dry. There's really only room for two people at their drying station. After sitting there for 15 minutes, one of the women said I'd be safe to leave (it's winter, and I had closed-toe shoes to wear). She sprayed some quick drying stuff on my toes, and off I went. Walked two blocks, ate dinner, walked to my car later that night. No surprises there, but there's a huge smudge on my big toe.

Ladies: the $19 price tag for the pedi is the only thing good about this place. Beyond that, I'd suggest trusting someone else with your little piggies.
