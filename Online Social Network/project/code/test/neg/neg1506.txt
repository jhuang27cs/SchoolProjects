Mediocre food, mediocre coffee.  I've tried their baked goods (nothing to write home about) and the coffee is alright when they get the order right.
Free wi-fi is a big plus, and the atmosphere is pretty good for studying-- it's more interesting to study here than a library.
I only really come in here because there's guaranteed table space-- that is until I was informed by staff member that I need to order something or get out.  I'm not a freeloader, if I'm by myself or thirsty/tired, I'll order a drink.  But when I'm meeting someone who has bought a drink, and the place is dead as a doornail, why would you give the guest of a paying customer 15-minute countdown to get a drink or leave?  A third of the tables are empty!  I know I can get a tea for a buck-- but it's the principle of the thing.  Very stupid policy, and I will not be returning.
