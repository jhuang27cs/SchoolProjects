I went to Upstairs on the Square with my boyfriend and his family when they were in town visiting.  He had selected the restaurant hoping it to be nice but not outrageously priced, and conveniently near their hotel.  The whole experience was just 'eh' and left us shrugging as we left.

The decor is trying to be over-the-top, girly/glamorous, in a kind of tonque in cheek way with a wink in a smile.  It falls just a bit short of achieving this and the result is a little to gaudy, overwhelming, and contrived, (though it did look better as the restaurant became darker).

The staff seemed a bit too pretentious for my tastes.

We ordered cocktails, but after my bf ordered one of their specials, the waiter returned to tell us that the bartender didn't know how to make it and he had to order something else.  What?  We were there on a Friday evening-- maybe their bartender called in sick at the last minute or something, but they should have someone on backup that can follow a recipe to mix a drink.  Also, they put a lime wedge in my Hendrick's G&T.  No.  It should be a cucumber slice.  That's just standard.

The food was not at all memorable.  Nothing was bad, it was just not especially good.  We got some kind of pizza for an appetizer that tasted bought in (it might not have been, but the quality was as such).  I had swordfish that I suspected was frozen do to a somewhat off texture.  The portions are on the small size, especially the sides.

Dessert was slightly more interesting, but nothing you couldn't find better versions of elsewhere.

To summarize: skip it.  There are so many better options than this location and looks-centric letdown.
