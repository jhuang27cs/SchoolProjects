I was very excited to come to this place because it seems to have a cool cult following because of Seinfeld. Boy, was I disappointed. The service was pretty horrible and the food was not good at all. Essentially it's stuff that was stocked in a freezer then deep fried and served with a heaping side of resentment.

I ordered a milkshake and my waiter brought me an empty cup. It was never filled with a shake. 

If you are excited to visit this place just visit, don't eat there. Take a picture of the outside and go somewhere else.
