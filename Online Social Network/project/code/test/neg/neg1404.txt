Just returned from dinner and had to tell everyone this is one big Miss!!!  Went because of the Yelp reviews, but anything but 5star.  Service was just terrible.  Don't mind waiting a few minutes between courses, but I think 20 minutes is too long.  Outdoor courtyard has potential, but the glaring light bulbs need to be turned down, walls should have some faux painting, windows need shutters, and more plants on walls and in and around fountain.  Planters are void of plants!!!  Cleared entree dishes and never returned to ask about dessert or coffee.  After another 15 minute wait, we decided just to flag down the next employee and request our cheque.  Saw an upcharge for a sauce that we didn't order, but the waitress tried to convince us that was the sause ordered.  It was removed from the cheque but thought the charge for the glass of wine was also incorrect.  Upon leaving I looked at the wine list and indeed the charge was more that listed on the wine menu.  Questioning it, I was told to contact the manager - better to warn potential guests through Yelp.
