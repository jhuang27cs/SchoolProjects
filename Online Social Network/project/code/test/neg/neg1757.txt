This Subway is in the middle of Westwood Village, close to Wilshire.  So needless to say, it smells a little strange and feels grungy throughout.  Customer service is lacking, maybe because the location is 24hours and I've only really been here at night.  Workers are robotic to say the least.  The food is average.  I know they microwave the soups, but I've never had my soup really taste microwaved...  This place is alright if I really need some food, but I actually really enjoy Subway and have definitely experienced better locations.
