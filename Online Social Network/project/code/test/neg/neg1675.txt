Replacing Lee's Sandwich Shop is the new Harvard Cafe, a simple counter-service sandwich shop doling out subs, hot and cold sandwiches, burgers and salads. 

The decor hasn't changed much. And we're not just talking since the shop changed hands...we're talking since the seventies most likely. But hole-in-the-wall quick and cheap lunch spots usually aren't known for atmosphere...they're known for their good, inexpensive food.

Well inexpensive and good Harvard Cafe is not. Today I wondered in ready to try Lee's for the first time, only to find out they changed the name (and ownership) to Harvard Cafe. For $9.19, I got a roast beef and cheese sandwich, on whole wheat bread, with lettuce and tomato, and a bottle water. The bread was nearly flat, the roast beef (what little there was) had a greasy, almost phosphorescent coloring and the cheese seemed like it'd been sitting out. Kind of warm, kind of mushy.

For the price and the size of the sandwich you get, you can easily go to the grocery store, buy a loaf of bread, some good Boar's Head meat and cheese, and some fresh lettuce and tomato, and make your own sandwiches at home for next to nothing. Or, you can go over to Market in The Square and pay about the same price for a manmouth sandwich of far superior quality.

Sorry Harvard Cafe, but I just don't see this going any where.
