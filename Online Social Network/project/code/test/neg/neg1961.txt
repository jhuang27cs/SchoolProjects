Ok, so I'm not thrilled about giving Milltown just 2 stars.  I've been there several times and mostly it is a positive experience.  Great beer selection, tasty veggie sliders and a great outdoor patio where we are allowed to have our dog--bonus!  There has been one pretty consistent thing that has been sour about this place, though, and that is the service.  I usually let it slide, because most of the time I sit on the patio enjoying the weather and gabbing away.  I notice, but I'm not too bothered.  This most recent time, though, my friend and I met there and specifically picked a booth inside thinking we'd get better service, 'cause I was hungry and not to mention parched.  I just needed water.  We did tell them we were waiting on possibly two more people, but  come on, a server could still bring out waters and ask if we wanted anything else while we waited, but no.  Also, there were just about a small gaggle of people "working" that could have popped over and there were not a whole lot of customers, so, no excuses.  One server lady was walking towards us and I was all like, yes, finally!  She stopped at the table next to us, though, and did not even acknowledge us.  Wow! Really, people?  This is your business.  Service.  Anyhow, we left when it seemed sure no one was going to help us and the situation just left me perplexed.
