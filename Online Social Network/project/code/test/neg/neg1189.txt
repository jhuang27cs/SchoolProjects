This place is decent compared to the other places on campus but honestly it's totally hyped. It's not even close to a good pot of french press brewed at home -- I find their coffee weak and watery. Often times I can taste their flavored coffees in their normal coffee carafes ... GROSS! What kind of self-respecting coffee place serves flavored coffee anyway? Usually crappy ones ... that's who!
