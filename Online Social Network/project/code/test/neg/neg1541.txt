Can't say that this was the best Italian food I've had, even in Westwood.  The food was okay as far as Italian goes. I had the gnocchi with bolognes sauce.   I found  it a bit dry as if it was sitting the pot too long.  The gnocchi wasn't as firm as I usually like it.  . For $15 I found the lunchtime meal a bit expensive.  As mentioned by others the service was very polite and welcoming.   Overall, the experience was nice but I've had much better.
