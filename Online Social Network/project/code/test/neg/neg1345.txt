One star simply for the horrible customer service. I've never encountered such rude staff. I'm convinced the only reason they're in business is because many Harvard students are forced to buy coursepacks there. The work they do is reasonable, but just having to go in there and talk to the employees is an enormous task. Plus there's usually not room to move, it's so crowded.
