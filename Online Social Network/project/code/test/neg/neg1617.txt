I'm gonna have to agree with most of the previous reviews and say that this place definitely has a lot to learn about customer service and making pho. Being a new business, I hope they improve down the road, but for now it's just not that great.

I came in with two of my roommates to see if what everyone's been writing is really true. Since Pho K&K is practically down the road from us, it was worth trying it. Their decor and friendliness is surprisingly exemplary for a pho establishment. Everything else, however, is just not up to par. 

It was just the three of us in the whole establishment, yet they somehow managed to screw up orders. We all got the #8 combination (one with everything, one with no flank and no meatballs, and one with no meatballs and steak on the side). Somehow, they only managed to get the one with everything right, and screwed up the other two orders. It's really not that hard considering there was no one else there. 

Once I got my $8 bowl, I stared at it for a while and thought "where's my meat?" I think they try to pass it off as a large bowl, allowing them to charge so much. However, I only saw one small piece of each kind of meat in my bowl. ONE PIECE!!! I'm sorry but I need more meat to fill me up (that's what she said?). If that wasn't enough, it didn't even taste that great. The broth was pretty good, and plenty of noodles, but just not enough meat for the price. 

Let's hope the owners read these reviews and implement some changes, or else I won't be back. Surprisingly, I saw a "People love us on Yelp" sticker on the window. Suspicious much?
