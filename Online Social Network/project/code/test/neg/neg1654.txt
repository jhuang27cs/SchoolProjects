La Burrita is possibly some of the worst Mexican food(if you could even call it that) i've ever had. I used to say that it was a late night bastion of cheese covered mediocrity, but that--i've come to realize-- is giving it way to much credit. In the case of La Burrita, in fact, it's almost an award. "Oh, but the nachos are so good" fans of this place will say when you cite the incontrovertible fact that their meat is reheated in microwaves and that the burritos are  nightmarish, tortilla encased slumber parties of guacamole and sour cream colored goop. I can't believe that the place is run Mexicans/Central Americans too. I would love to ask these guys if this is what they cook at home...if this is how Mom used to make it. I doubt it. It's a good thing that Berkeley has a constant supply of visitors and students who don't know a lick about good Mexican food, because this place would be out of business. You should only be so luck to be blacked out when your night of drinking Winner's Cup Vodka lands you at this haunt.
