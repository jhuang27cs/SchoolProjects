First and foremost i would like to say that I LOVE greek food. However, this restaurant was beyond disappointing. I have had better Gyros at those generic burger joints that have gyros and mexican food on their extensive menus.  Everything had wayyyy too much oil and some kind of powder on it. They couldnt even get a salad right. The food was not fresh. I would not return.
