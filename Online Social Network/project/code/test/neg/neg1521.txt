I hate to give this restaurant a "Meh." review, but after going here several times, I can't justify giving it any higher than two stars. 

Let me first say that the people in the restaurant are very nice. They have been accommodating of my requests and they prepare food quickly. 

However, I've never been satisfied with the food I've received. The first time I went, the pad thai I ordered was dry and sticky. Last time I went, I ordered curry chicken. The chicken was rubbery and the sauce was excessively oily.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. If you're hungry and walking around Shadyside, there are a lot of other restaurants to try.
