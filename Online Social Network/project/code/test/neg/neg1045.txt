I was STARVING one might and my friend wanted to get red mango so I decided to give Flame Broiler a try. I was enticed by the "healthy!" sign, since I had been eating so unhealthy for the past few days.
I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies, and I watched the guy make my order. I think he had premade chicken that he cut up into pieces and put on top of brown rice. Then, he heated up some pre cooked veggies by placing them in boiling water and then putting them on top. Finally, he put teriyaki sauce over the whole thing.
The final product was big, and filling, but wasn't too good. It kind of reminded me of something from panda express or something... just asian fast food.
I won't come back here in the near future, but I guess I would come back if i was in the area and was really craving some cheap asian food.
