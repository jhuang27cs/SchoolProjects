The first, only and last time I've been here I was hit on by an excruciatingly boring man.  He proceded to describe to me in detail a comic strip his brother had written, which I think is rediculous.  Visual art is visual for a reason.  Then he questioned whether his brother still loved him.  I contemplated killing myself. I wonder if he would have noticed.  All there really is to do is watch people play pool, try to ignore the horrible loud music, and balance over the dirty toilet seat in the bathroom.  I don't like this place.  They won't even let you in if you don't have ID. I don't think people are exactly beating down the door, they could use those underage customers.
