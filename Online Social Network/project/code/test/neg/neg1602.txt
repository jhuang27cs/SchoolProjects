Went to buy a new iPhone. I was 20th in line. They were out of 16g black phones. They didn't bother to tell anyone like me waiting in line that. They tried to sell me a 32g phone instead or pay money now for a phone delivered sometime a few weeks from now. Very cheesy attempt to upsell phones and waste people's time. I told the line they were out of phones and the manager chased me out. Hilarious!

Went to Radio Shack on Pearl Street. Those guys hooked me up in no time. Go to Radio Shack!
