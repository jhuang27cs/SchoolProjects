My extended family and I went here after my sister's college graduation.  I had read the reviews prior to eating here (thanks yelp) so I was prepared for the bad out of date decor. The menu for lunch was lack luster.  The salad bar didn't seem to look appealing.  I settled on a bbq chicken sandwich with fries.  My food came out last and some how ended up with bacon on it.  No complaints.  But the sandwich was dry with very little bbq sauce and nothing else besides lettuces tomato and onion.  The rest of my family seemed to feel the same way.  A grilled chicken breast with a side? Meh  And the service wasn't all that good.  Our waiter kept disappearing.  My family did order a dessert which they said was good.
