Horrible. After spending $15 dollars on a chicken/broth/noodle bowl I threw it away after three bites because it tasted so bad. The employees were not helpful at all for a newer restaurant and nothing seemed ethnic about it. After Han Dynasty being in the neighborhood, you really cannot compete. 

It is such prime real estate though. I can't wait to see what goes in to this space after this place closes.
