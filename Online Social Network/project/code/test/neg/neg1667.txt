Normally, it would pain me to write a really negative review.  In this case, it will not pain me at all.  Melissa is going to be bringing down The Bladerunner's Yelp rating due to her awful customer service.  Melissa, when you have an appointment, you are supposed to show up.  When you fail to show up to the scheduled event, you do bad business.  It's understandable that from time to time things happen causing you to have to cancel.  If that were the situation and you notified us and found us someone else to do your job, things would be okay.  This is not the case.  You failed to show up.  You never contacted us to let us know you were showing up.  After calling several times and leaving voice mails, you finally return the phone call a couple of hours later asking if it is too late to still come out?  Bad bad bad business practice.  Even worse business when following up while trying to get a refund.  Please do yourselves a favor and find another hairdresser.  There are plenty to choose from in SLO.  Hopefully you will not make the same mistake we made.
