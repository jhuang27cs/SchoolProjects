Came in twice to get a women's annual exam. Even though i had an appointment, i literally sat there for 1.5 hours when they didn't even seem busy at all. I don't why they would make their patients wait for so long. I have friends who have gone there and told me the same thing about the wait time.
I would not recommend her, unless you would like to sit at her office and read a book for 2 hours.
