Went here in an attempt to satisfy my craving for an espresso and a croissant, and I came back disappointed on both counts. For a place that gets such high praise for its coffee, their espresso was incredibly acidic and bordering on the undrinkable. The croissant wasn't very good either, lacking the light, crispy flakiness that a croissant is supposed to have. I won't blame all of that on Rao's, as croissants are frequently misinterpreted in the US, but it's sort of sad that Trader Joe's bake-off croissants are noticeably better than these. Next time, I'll stay home and brew myself some coffee in my stove top moka pot, and have some TJ croissants to go with it--it'll be cheaper and infinitely better.

Also, I'm not sure if I should add or subtract points for the hobo crawling through the place (crawling, yes--you read that right), but it definitely makes for a unique experience...
