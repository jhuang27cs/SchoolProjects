Wow. So I went here last night with my gf and some friends, straight passed up on Fat Slice like it was the thing to do only because I had been craving sushi all week. Needless to say I was utterly disappointed.

I understand the point of stepping outside the box to make imaginative rolls but seriously who the hell puts ketchup on sushi? That's like.. .. ok its so ridiculous that I can't even come up with a metaphor. Lame. 

We had 

Oishii
Spicy Sweet Roll 
Seaweed salad
Chicken Teriyaki bento
Bear roll [? I think]

The sushi was cold, and very bland in taste. Soon after dinner me and my gf had stomach aches, GROSS lol. Oh and don't bother coming here if you expect to have a cold bottle of Sapporo, because they don't serve any alcohol. 

The prices were reasonable, the tab came out to $40 something for the 4 of us.. even so, next time I'll think twice about passing on greasy crispy pepperoni pizza.
