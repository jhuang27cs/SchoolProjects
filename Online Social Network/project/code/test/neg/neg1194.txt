Sometimes restaurants tries to invent new dishes.  Fortunately/ Unfortunately it either turns into success or not much success.  Unfortunately, there are some dishes at New Delhi that attempts to make new inventions that need to go back to the drawing board.  
Last week, we had the buffet
Chicken Wing Pakora's:  fried too long or left too long on the buffet table.
Mixed Veggies were too oily.  
Naan had alot of Gee (melted butter), also Naan was cooked too long so it became too chewy.  
Tandoori Chicken was really red on the outside.  
Lamb:  Could use alot more flavor.  Also, they used all boneless pieces.  Please consider using goat and pieces around the ribs, it'll make your sauce alot more flavorful.
Rice Pudding is good.  Although it's missing cardamon and alittle nutmeg.
New Delhi has some highlights such as their rice pudding.  However, it's really hard to give this place more than 2 stars when tandoori chicken is cold and hard, and new inventions such as Chicken Wing Pakora is really bland and dry.
