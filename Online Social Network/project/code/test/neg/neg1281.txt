I had fond memories of this place, especially their pizza, which is one of the reasons we decided to try this place out for brunch on our way out of town. After being there, I kind of wish we hadn't. Their food wasn't terrible by any means, but it wasn't too great either. My fiancee had fried eggs with a side of bacon and toast. The bacon was terrible, which we immediately told our server about. (She was nice enough to take that off the bill) The eggs were little bit runnier that we had hoped. I had their 8" NY Style Pizza w/ Green Peppers and Red Onion. When I think of NY Style, I think of real thin and crispy kind of pizza. This was far from it. Again, it was okay, but not really what I was hoping for.
