Terrible food + Terrible service = Don't bother.

I came with a group for a birthday. To start, the waiter we had was incredibly obnoxious and gave one of my group huge attitude about his order. He just asked which dishes were vegetarian! In Salento's defense, the table opposite us had a great waiter who seemed very attentive; still, this waiter was way over the top. 

As for the food, I had the pasta pugilese, with calamari, shrimp, etc. It was probably the blandest dish I've ever had in my life. Everyone else at the table ordered something different and nobody really liked what they had other than the salmon. One even mentioned their pasta looked like Easy Mac...for the prices you're paying, that's ridiculous. 

Even the atmosphere wasn't great. The music was distracting, switching between Katy Perry and random hits from the 70's...I guess the lighting was good?
