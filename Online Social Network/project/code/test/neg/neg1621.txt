Nothing is gourmet about the franks.  They simply offer a variety and grill it in front of you with some toppings added at the end.  Service is fast, but unfriendly and unhelpful.  Plus, they ran out of their GF special fries, which basically look like waffle fries even though they can't describe them or what's so special about them.  Food and drinks are overpriced here.  

Why not walk around the corner to La Baguette for something gourmet and that is tastier and worth the price?  The sad thing is I'd rather have McDonald's like the other reviewer than eat here again.
