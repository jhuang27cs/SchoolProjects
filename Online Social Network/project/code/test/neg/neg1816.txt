The food is good and it has a nice ambiance, but without a coupon this place is incredibly over priced.
My wife got a coupon for the Grand Cheese 8 course dinner for $80 and we went last Saturday. It is a nice cozy restaurant in a Back Bay basement. We ordered a bottle of wine (we wanted the Pinot Noir from California but they brought us the one from New Zealand) and they brought the courses quickly. The fondue and raclette were very good and a decent size, everything else was Tapas size. I did enjoy the ravioli with mushrooms (the one with lobster was overwhelmed by the good tomato sauce) and the vinegar on the appetizers was excellent. 
The owner is very visible and makes you feel welcome and our waiter was very nice
Without the coupon the bill would have been $215 without the tip, really outrageous when you think of what you can get for that at other restaurants.
