Had my first and what will likely be my only experience at the west egg, service was slow although the place wasn't busy or cleared out.  Sent back 3 orders of their challah french toast because the first 2 were undercooked and filled a horrifying gelatinous substance (undercooked egg, which is never good) and when they so"kindly" remade the dish it was burnt to a crisp.  Someone needs a new chef cuz there is  a serious problem if a breakfast/lunch specialty place can't even make some damned french toast correctly after 3 tries.  It was the biggest letdown yet of my culinary excursions and even more frustrating cuz we had been looking forward to trying the place which is quite hard to when there are so many other, better, & similar restaurants around the area.
