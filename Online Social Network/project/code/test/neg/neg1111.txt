The Yelp description for two stars is "Meh.  I've experienced better."  And I have.  In my own kitchen; with my own haphazard cooking.  This is not Chinese food.  It looks like it and might vaguely smell like it but that's where it ends.

Yes, I'd rather eat my own mystery concoctions because although they look questionable, they at least taste okay.  I'll admit the food here doesn't taste bad.  But it doesn't taste good.  Actually, it doesn't taste like anything.  Maybe it's a season-it-yourself kind of establishment.

I came here with a group and we all agreed that while portions were overly generous and prices were low, the food was not really worth it.  After all, if you're unwilling to eat the leftovers, does that make it good value?  I think not; and as a student, value means everything.

Service was spotty.  We asked for waters and they never came, so after our food came down we eventually managed to successfully wave down a server to ask for them.  Cups are not necessarily clean.

Not much to say about ambiance; typical student hang-out.  Clean.  Didn't check the bathroom.

Might have better luck with happy hour drinks.  But I'm definitely not in a rush to go back.
