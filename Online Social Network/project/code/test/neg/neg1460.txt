I will not shop at Pavillions again until they improve the quality of their shopping bags. Tonight was the last straw. I purchased two bottles of Tejava, and they were bagged in one bag. From my car to the house both bottles went through the bottom of the bag shattering on the stairs. I cut my foot on the glass. For a high end store like pavillions to have far inferior bags to a store like Fresh and Easy is ridonkulous. Please join my boycott until they improve bag quality.
