This was my first time coming to Tin Drum, and my friend and I should have chosen something else. You pay first and its pretty much self service. When my friend and I walked in, we asked the guy at the register what he would recommend before we ordered. He told us the Japanese katsu curry was good, and I have had authentic Japanese curry before so I was really excited to try theirs. I should have known better when he asked me if I wanted jalapenos on it...Once it came, there wasn't anything Japanese about it! The rice was ordinary and the curry was at the bottom of the bowl. The curry itself tastes more Indian. It just wasn't what I was expecting, I doubt I will come back because I could get "Asian" food at the mall for cheaper.

The only good thing is their portion sizes I guess, my meal was about $8 including a fountain drink.


It was loud and crowded but it was also a friday night in atlantic station.
