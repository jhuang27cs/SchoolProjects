The Newman gets my business for mostly for it's incredibly convenient location close to the architecture department, and, as another reviewer pointed out, it's even closer to the business school.  Prices are good too, and all-day cheap breakfast is nice.  

That's about where it stops for me, though.  I don't know, maybe these guys are a real win compared to UMass dining services, but for someone who lives off campus, loves to cook, and is used to eating in places where the food is actually good, The Newman never feels like anything more than serviceable, an easy spot to get passable coffee or put a cheap blob of something warm in my stomach so I can make it through my next class.  

To be fair, I don't think they have any aspirations to culinary greatness, but I wish that the choices there were less greasy.  Even the breakfasts, which are hard to screw up, tend to feel a little gross after noon or so.  They are cooked on the same griddle as everything else, using too much cheap oil, and the student cooks are not so great about keeping a clean grill, so often an egg sandwich ends up tasting like the bad oil and bits of grilled sandwiches you find stuck to your egg.  Home-fries seem like they start frozen and are definitely cooked in a deep fryer, which is just not necessary or good.  

Sandwiches and burgers are nothing special.  Mostly, they taste of cheap ingredients and careless preparation.  

Coffee here is as good as anywhere on campus, nothing special but the same decent cup of Raos you can get in the library or a number of other places.  No complaints there, but it's sad that beyond coffee, they don't do as well as they could.
