They are one of the businesses out there that makes money on shipping. I order some touch up bottles from them. I ship all the time so I know UPS charges them about $11 to ship it. They charged me $28.07. Also they will not tell you the status of your order, if it's been shipped, or if there's any problem until you contact them. Absolutely poor customer service. They sell the bottles that I need. I've been looking and nobody else has them for sale. I wish there was another option because I hate ordering from these people.
