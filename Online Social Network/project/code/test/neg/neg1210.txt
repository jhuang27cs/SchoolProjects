Sure the food might be mediocre.  But it's cheap.  And it's plentiful.  And it's available late at night and on weekends.  And honestly, what more could a college student reasonably expect?

Service is a bit apathetic, as some others have noted.  I'm docking a star for that.  I also considered docking another star (but didn't) for the ghetto-fabulous booty-shaking mix that always seems to be annoyingly blasting over the speaker system.  *Sigh*  I guess that's what all the kids are listening to these days...
