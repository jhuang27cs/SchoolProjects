One word to describe this place-DISGUSTING!  I sort of wished that I threw up the second I put the first bite in my mouth.  I had the Mexican dosa and it was just vile.  
NEVER EVER go downstairs to the bathroom.  I wish I had gone before I left the office, but I really really had to tinkle, so I made the mistake of going here.  Let's just say that the floor in a porta-potty would have been cleaner.  
To top our horrible experience off, the guy at the counter was a total jerk and no personality whatsoever.  I don't think that he knew how to smile either.
