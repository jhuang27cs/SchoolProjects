I've always hated this Dominos because they don't take almost all Dominos coupons, but now I REALLY hate them... introducing the $1.50 delivery charge. 

With so many better pizza options in the 'hood that deliver for free, I guess I won't be ordering from Dominos again until I move below 100th st. (the cutoff for this store.)

Also, they've completely borked their online account system. It doesn't save past orders anymore and you can't delete old locations.
