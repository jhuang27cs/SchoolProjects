I can't really fully give the best review from what i've experienced because my first time there was an in and out kind of thing. but based on what i saw, the clothes are cute but i think we can all agree that its pretty pricey for clothes that are so thin and lightweight. and the  customer service was horrible. there was like two workers there yet not even a single greet or smile out of them.  but then again, its palo alto, the uptight part. so i'm not surprised. but again. this was only an in and out experience, so i probabaly wouldn't know much yet. HAHA
