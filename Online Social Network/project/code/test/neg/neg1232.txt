Well I'll start by saying that I am not a big fan of excessively greasy NYC style pizza.  Not to say that it doesn't have its merits, it just doesn't really fit my liking.  That being said, Fat Tino's is the best (and really only) place in the immediate area that serves that kind of pizza.

I got the 18" pepperoni pie for just over $14. My first words as I opened up the box was "My God....that is unbelievably greasy". Imagine the greasiest pizza you have ever had, then dump some more grease on and you've got it, which might explain how Tino got so fat ;-)

So I dug in: it folded well, just like it is supposed to and was tasty enough.  It didn't really taste special however.  All of the ingredients were really run-of-the-mill and just tasted like an alright (nothing special) pizza.  The reason I am giving Fat Tino's two stars is the pizza itself was unremarkable and mediocre, but required so many paper towels to get up only a fraction of the grease that it was more disgusting than it was worth.  In my opinion a pizza should only be allowed to be that greasy if it has true merit.....next time I'm probably going back to Pizza Hut :-/
