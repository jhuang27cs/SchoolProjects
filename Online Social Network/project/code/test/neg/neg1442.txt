I love cupcakes however I am not impressed by sprinkles.  Too many other good cupcakes in the world to waste your time here.  They need to work on a few things:
The why you order and pay=Chaos
The frosting is too firm
The frosting to cupcake ratio, not in good proportion
They are not very creative, where the filling or fun flavors?
Come on! NO!
