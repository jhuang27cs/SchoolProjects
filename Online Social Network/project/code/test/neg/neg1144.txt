This review is of The Gooch Cafe, and not Whole Foods.......
I am a total fan of healthy, raw and natural... but this cafe did not wow me...
I ordered an iced Chai tea latte .... thumbs down... tasted more like milk with a Chai aftertaste... blah
Ordered a Key Lime Pie small tart..... it was okay....but for six bucks, I could have bought a key lime pie at Trader Joe's and brought a fork...  
I don't know... I guess the prices are due to the "high rent district" but really.... I would have felt better about dropping my money in a can to feed starving children in India rather than indulge myself in an overpriced bland tasting treat......
