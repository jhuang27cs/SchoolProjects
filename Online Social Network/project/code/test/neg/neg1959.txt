Although our food was very tasty, and the hostess/bar staff were very kind, the food made me horribly sick.  The pizza we ordered tasted a bit funny but we ate it anyway.  I ate a little more for breakfast (it's pizza, after all) the next day.  I spent the next 3 days in bed with a stomach bug.  We noticed that the pizza leftovers smelled rancid and threw them away.

I wrote to the restaurant to let them know and their response was essentially, we're sorry but it wasn't us...no one else got sick.

with all due respect, Gather, when two people who hadn't seen each other in over 2 months get sick at precisely the same time after eating a meal at your restaurant, I suspect it is you...

I won't be going back anytime soon...
