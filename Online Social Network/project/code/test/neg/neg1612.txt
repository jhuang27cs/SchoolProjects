The one reason I'd hesitate to give Ken's only 1-star is for the fact that our experience is now a funny story to tell. We went shopping at 5 Austin area bakeries with high online ratings  and brought back samples of cookies, muffins, and other goodies.  Our #1 criteria was overall taste was the main criteria. There were six of us who taste tested back at home. 

Going to Ken's was unique. I'll keep the story out of it, but suffice it to say that the service was jarring (not in a good way), and the food was no different than going to a doughnut house in its final years (you know the type - they were great at one point, but you can tell by looking around that their day in the sun is about over). Not to say that this is true of Ken's - it's just the vibe we got. Getting out of Ken's parking lot is extremely difficult as well. So, food, bad; ambience, bad; food, kids loved it - adults hated it; price, great. That is really the positive take-away - it's cheap food is perfect for hungry college kids.
