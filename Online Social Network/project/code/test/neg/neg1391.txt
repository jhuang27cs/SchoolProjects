A friend and I were in the mood for yogurt so we ended up at Swirl. And it wasn't great.. 

Pros: it's spacious, clean & not too noisy

Cons: the fruit wasn't all that fresh, the chunks of fruit were too big, the flavors were less than alright

For something so simple as yogurt, Swirl just hasn't got it figured out. I usually love dessert spots but not this one. Next time I'm in Rice Village I'm definitely going to Berripop instead.
