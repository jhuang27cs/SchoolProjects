I've seen mice run through the store. Even worse, I've seen bags of food nibbled through by rodent teeth ON THE SHELVES. I realize that all restaurants have rodent issues, but not IN the store, in the very products they're selling. 

I would love to shop here again, as it is the only convenience store in town, but for now they've lost my business.
