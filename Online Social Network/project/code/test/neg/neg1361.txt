Pampas, what happened?

I wanted to take my cousins out as a thank you for letting me stay the weekend, so I chose Pampas because of a great experience I had a year or so before. I never expected to have such horrible service, it almost made the evening awkward. The restaurant was not packed and we were a small group, it took the server what seemed like forever to take our drink order. He didn't even speak when he walked up to the table, my cousin had to say..."Sir, can we order our drinks?" We didn't get the usual spiel about how a churrascaria works, just blank stares. It was bizarre.

I'll move on to the food, it wasn't as great as I remember, many of the meats were over seasoned and the servers wouldn't come to our table very often. Maybe it was an off night, but this made me not want to bring people here when I'm back in town.
