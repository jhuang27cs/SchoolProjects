When I found this on yelp I had to double check my location because the customer service people rave about on here is unlike anything i experienced. 
With that in mind, perhaps I was the victim of someone having a bad day,i hate my job,life sucks, etc...
Shopped here this weekend. 
I have two dogs, the boy peed TWICE. I looked around for clean stations so i could clean it up myself, didn't find one. 
2 dogs came in and the owners and I started chatting, petting all the dogs--One of the new dog arrivals PEED again, one nice urine party broken up by a grumpy young worker who told us to move so she can clean up our mess. 
I quickly told her there are no napkins in the store, i looked and i became distracted but planned on cleaning some how and she pulled a few napkins from her roll of paper towels and said HERE while she mumbled "its everywhere" !
Instantly i went into b!tch mode and reminded her i looked for a clean up station and turned to my boyfriend and asked him to wait outside with the dogs because "This girl just discovered she earns a paycheck at a pet store and accidents happen" - those were my exact words, i marched to the register, she disappeared and another girl came to ring me up. 
THE END. 
Will never go back.
