Stopped by here for some quick breakfast between my doctors appointments at UCLA. The service wasn't too bad but, the food was terrible. I got a build your own Grandslam. Was told they were out of sausage. I substituted my eggs for egg whites. Somehow, they managed to burn the egg whites... WTF?

Honestly, did they just pour them into the pan and forget about them? One side was runny the other side was burnt. Gnarly!

I don't know what's going on in the kitchen here. Take your money elsewhere.
