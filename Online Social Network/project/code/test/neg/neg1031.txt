I have come to conclusion that this place is being rated by hungry inebriated college students who want to eat way too late because they are either partying or procrastinating for a test the next day, so know that all of the good reviews are slanted heavily towards those who are blinded by the convenience of the location and the hours of operation and the "Austin cool" factor.

I found this place by accident because I thought it was "Rudy's," which turns out to be superior to the likes of "Ruby's." Ruby's may have won a few awards ten years ago, but the reason they don't have updated awards is because they just must not seem to care anymore!

There were portions of my turkey that were cold but I didn't feel like dealing with asking for more because it looked like it had be reheated anyway. The black beans tasted like they were worse than pulling the cheapest store brand black beans from a can, prior to draining the nasty-azz liquid (lolzers I am sooo smart for that one).

The sauce was the best thing on the menu but unfortunately my body cannot sustain itself on sugary liquids. I also appreciate that this place has an option of wheat bread and doesn't feel too cool to get with the times and be healthy, unlike other bbq places (*ahem* Rudy's: how many times am I going to have to request wheat bread on your menu in your suggestion box?!).

Won't be back here and it is probably staying alive because of all of the people being miss-directed on their way to "Rudy's"
