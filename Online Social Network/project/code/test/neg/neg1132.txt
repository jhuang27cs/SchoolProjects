I've been to Mad Mex many times and it USED TO BE one of my favorite places around the area. Today not only they served me the WORST fajita I have ever had the manager was still able to be condescending, disrespectful and just really RUDE in general. When I told him the fajita was raw and "very hard to eat" first he wanted to teach me what medium rare is. I told him very nicely that I had trouble biting it and I had to check after a couple of bites; I was giving it another shot. I didn't want to cause a scene or complain because I'm there with a group of friends and everyone wants a dinner without a problem. I had half of my plate and therefore the manager insinuated that I was doing this for the money considering I had half the plate. The compensation was far from being the issue at the time because of how frustrated I got with this person giving me an attitude and treating me terribly: not listening, not caring, humiliating me in front of a group of friends trying to teach me what kind of food I ordered and "how it's supposed to be." NO it's not how it's supposed to be. NO. I have had medium rare fajitas before and some of those were at Mad Mex. Considering the quality of food they put in front of me the least he can do is be NICE. He gave us the bill back half the fajita's money taken off -7.50- which we then gave to the waitress. You know why? Because she was NICE.
