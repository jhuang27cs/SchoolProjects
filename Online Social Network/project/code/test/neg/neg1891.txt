Tasty, but I cannot understand why they cannot deliver on their product quantity. You have to get to the stores when they open to get your choice of bagels. No sense even going since they run out of most bagels in the middle of the day. With so many choices to eat in Houston, I would rather go elsewhere if I am expected to be on their watch; and they aren't all that. Why stay open past noon if they can't produce the product?
