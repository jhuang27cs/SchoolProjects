Be very careful of their mobile devices!!!  They charged me in the shoe department.  Then their mobile device malfunctioned.  Claimed the charge did not go through when in fact it did go through and I could prove it by logging into my charge account on my smart phone.  So then.....they send me up to customer service!  The very snarky lady in customer service would not give me my shoes and wanted to charge me twice.  As if this who mess-up was my fault!  I ended up waiting in customer service for 1/2 an hour.  They DID charge me twice.  I had to get the charges reversed 3 days later which took 2 more phone calls.   Do NOT let them use their mobile device.  Go to the cash register.  And be sure to get a paper receipt.  And stay away from customer service.
