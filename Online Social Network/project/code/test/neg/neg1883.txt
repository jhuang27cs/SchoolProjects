This place is OVER PRICED for gross food. 
I would only go back if I was on the run and needed a bagel or something. 
I had the cesar salad from here and my dressing literally looked and tasted like flavored mayo. 

They have a "vietnamese" sandwich that looked like Roger Rabbit assembled (spinach with sliced carrots in my banh mi??? YUCK!)

Go to the Boalt Law cafe, better food at the least!!!!!
