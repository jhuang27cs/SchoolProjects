We live near the Village and always go to our usual places and decided that we would try something different for a change. The service was horrible, well really no service until I made eye contact with a server multiple times and he came over and took our order. We ordered 2 beers and a cheese plate as a starter. The one that was supposed to be waiting on us, was too busy coughing all over the food window. We watched her do this and then serve a table their food. She then proceeded to the bar and coughed into her hands, did not wash them and then proceeded to another table putting her hands all over the tops of their water  glasses and touching all of the condiments on the table. It just grossed me out and we canceled our order and left.So with horrible service and unsanitary conditions we will not be back. There are some good reviews of this place, so maybe we just picked the wrong day to go, but would not go back to see.
