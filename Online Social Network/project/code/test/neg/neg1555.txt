so, I decided to go here cause I wanted to spend like 2-3 dollars on a couple of flowers. I was not expecting a whole lot, maybe like 2 really pretty flowers. I walk in, am looking around, and he makes me a flower arrangement for 4-5 dollars! I am so not into spending that, so I ask him to remove some things, and we get it down to two dollars. He reaches over and picks up an extra flower and puts it in there. when I ask him to wrap it up, I ask him how much. He says, "$2.50. I look suprised and he says, I gave you an extra flower... I'm so not coming back here again...talk about trying to scam for a few extra cents.
