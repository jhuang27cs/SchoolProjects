I had high hopes for this place, but alas, was disappointed.  While they have a good selection for burgers, it's expensive!  If you want anything more than a classic burger, with no cheese ($8.90 - want cheese? $9.65) expect to spend upwards of $10 on a small burger.  They don't come with fries or anything else, so you literally get a small burger on a plate for $10-$13.  The burgers are juicy, yes but it also makes the small potato bun really soggy.  For $10+, you expect the burger to come with something, but alas, it's all extra.

The fries are nothing to write home about.  We actually wound up leaving some, because they were overcooked and dry.  Ordered the Parmesan jalapeno - it was plain fries sprinkled with Parmesan and some jalapeno...disappointing to say the least. 

For 2 people, we ordered 2 burgers, 1 thing of fries, and a growler of beer, and spent over $60.  Next time I'll stick to Five Guys or Shake Shack.
