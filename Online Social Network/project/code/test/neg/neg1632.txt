After I read the good reviews of this place, I finally stopped in for lunch. I must have ordered the wrong thing - the grilled cheese b/c it was not worth $13. I make better grilled cheese at home...My fiance got the Chicken BLT and did not like it at all. He said it was flavorless. Overpriced and plain food. The 2nd star is for the cute atmosphere.
