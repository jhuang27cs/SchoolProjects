Let me first start of by saying that if you are disabled, or have difficulty walking, this store is NOT for you. My impression of IKEA is not what I had hoped for at all. First of all, it's like a maze, impossible to navigate through the store. It took us 15 minutes just to find an exit, and after we followed the signs leading to the parking garage, it took another 10 minutes just to get to the garage. I've never seen such a confusing store layout, then again, it's more like an airport, but at least those are less confusing - if you're in another country!!! I think if you spent 12 hours shopping there, you would STILL not be done.

Second of all...I understand after after having to walk around 3 football fields worth of space, one would get hungry. But come one, going to a furniture store just to eat at their restaurant?????? No thanks! I don't care how good the food is, I just prefer eating at a real restaurant.

So once we did get there (via 2 escalator rides from the parking garage), we were shopping for a new couch. The selection is poor to say the least. The fabric couches looked so cheap, as if the material was made out of tent fabric, WTH? The prices were not all that low either, $599 for a fabric sofa? I expected this place to have much lower prices. 

Needless to say, I won't be back. I was looking for nice looking, affordable couches and after going to a few more stores around my house, found a sofa and loveseat combo for $699, can't beat that!
