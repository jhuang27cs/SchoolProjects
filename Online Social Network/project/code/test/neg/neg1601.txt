TWO YEARS I choked down the slimy tofu eggplant before someone told me that Panda's brown sauce is not vegetarian.  (There's chicken stock in it.)

I know... I should have not taken the surly counter-staff's word for it when they told me it was veggie-suitable.

But I challenge anyone to come up with a reason (besides sadism) that that hateful panda would put TOFU EGGPLANT on a menu and not clearly indicate that it's covered in chicken fat.  

Cos I think the people who are likely to get excited about tofu and eggplant are not likely to get excited about meat juice on their tofu.

I don't even like eggplant!

HATE HATE HATE.
