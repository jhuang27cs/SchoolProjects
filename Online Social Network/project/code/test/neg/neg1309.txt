I am easily pleased yet this place was disgusting.  The menu is lacking options and I still am not sure how they are going to claim that they are a dim sum restaurant with such paltry options. 

My lemon chicken was absolutely revolting while my friends Schezuan chicken was equally vile.  I left feeling incredibly sick and it continued into the next day. 

Avoid Scallions like the plague!
