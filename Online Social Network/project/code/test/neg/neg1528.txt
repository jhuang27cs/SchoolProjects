I maybe from Cali but my roots are Alabama. The Yelpers telling you that the shrimp n' grits are fabulous do not know what shrimp n' grits suppose to taste like! The grits were lukewarm and reconstituted from the night before NOT FRESH!!! The shrimp were done well and you get four large ones per order. The duck quesidilla was good and their salsa was money. I give that 3-4 stars. The best was New Castle for 3 bucks and the service (5 stars)!!! Great beer selection. The chicken sausage was not that tasty as well. I was hoping for more reading these reviews but you guys let me down in the dirty south! SMDH!!!!!!! Do you even know what grits suppose to taste like and the texture supposed to be like people?!?!?!
