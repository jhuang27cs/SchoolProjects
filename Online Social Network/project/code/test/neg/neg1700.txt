Brunch Bust.

We were informed the mimosas were unlimited. Sadly, that was not the case and champagne cost $8 a glass, after 2. I paid it because Lord knows we needed it at this serious/drama/emotional brunch.

The food selection was impressive, not enough to be overwhelming but lots of choices. There was an omelet maker I'm sad I missed. I'm ALWAYS excited to see eggs Benedict, plus the other breakfast friendly pork options of bacon ans sausage, smoked salmon.

The one sushi roll did feel a tad out of place, so did the cold cut assortments.

Pluses- the staff was very courteous, and nice, although a little slow with the water. For $40 buck or so, I'd probably take my brunch butt somewhere else tho.
