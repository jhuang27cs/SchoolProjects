Back in October 2010, I booked a room here for a three night stay during my college reunion in April 2011.  The next day, I realized the dates for the reunion listed on my college's website were off by one extra day and I didn't need the third night at the hotel.  I called that day (one day after booking) and explained the situation politely to the hotel manager, but they refused to let me out of the third night's prepaid reservation.  Even the director of alumnae affairs called the hotel manager and explained the error on the college's website and requested that I be let out of the third night's reservation, but the hotel wouldn't budge on the non-refundable reservation. They weren't even willing to issue a credit for use on a future date.

I can understand why a relatively small boutique hotel might have non-refundable reservations during peak periods, like reunion weekend.  Its not fair to loose potential bookings because the room has been reserved for someone who ends up canceling at the last minute. That said, this reservation was made SIX MONTHS in advance, the extra night was booked because of an error on my college's website,  I called the day after the reservation was made to request cancellation of the third night AND no business was lost due to my reservation of that third night (plenty of rooms remained available on that day). 

Frankly I'm shocked and deeply disappointed in Casa 425's inflexibility and find this failure of hospitality unforgivable.  I would recommend that you stay away.
