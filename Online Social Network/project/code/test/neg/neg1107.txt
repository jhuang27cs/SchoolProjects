It is with a heavy heart I am here to announce my journey with Magnolia has come to an end. 
Magnolia was truly a chic, quaint oasis in this suburbia wasteland.

Came here with some buds on Groupon. It was surprisingly packed for a weeknight, so I guess the internet discount sensation did its magic. 
During a very bewildering conversation with the waiter, we were told the  $5 all-you-can-eat Mac & Cheese deal couldn't be put on the Groupon tab, so my friend would have to open his separate tab. The waiter was nice and said he'd try to resolve the issue. When the manager/owner lady came up, we brought up the same question again. The policy seemed ridiculously arbitrary and rigid. And arithmetically speaking, our party of 5 would have easily hit the $40 Groupon mark which means we'd be consuming at regular price after a certain point. But no, good math and customer service escaped the lady, her face turned steel gray, accused us of "working the system", gave a huge sigh, turned around and left. Never to return that night. The debacle doesn't end here. 1 hour later the pizza we ordered still hadn't come, we flagged down two waiters, one of which responded there had been a rush of orders. I'd like to see a pizza that doesn't turn to ash after an hour in the oven. Please don't lie to me when you never even bothered to roll out the dough in the first place.

I understand it's a tough economy and gimmicks like Groupon is probably making Magnolia bleed through all its bodily holes. The tabs really weren't that big of a deal, wish things hadn't gone so All-My-Children or As-the-World-Turns. 

It begs the question: Is Groupon a good idea for all businesses? Are all companies capable of handling high business volume with tact and navigating the intricacies of promotions and discounts with grace?
