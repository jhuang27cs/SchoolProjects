Everyone raves about Cliff's, but I don't understand the appeal.  I try to support local businesses but I can get better quality meat at Harris Teeter, Fresh Market, etc.  First, I'll cop to being somewhat intimidated by the selection.  Upon entering, my knowledge of chops always seems to evaporate, leaving me unsure of what to get.  This being a butcher, I'd expect employees willing to assist, but I haven't seen that to be the case.  On my visits I've been stonewalled into ordering nothing fancier than a fillet.

The meat I've gotten at Cliff's has never been especially good.  It's always very "gamey" and lacks flavor.  I've also gotten some crappy cuts here when I wasn't paying 100% attention to what was being wrapped up.  You really have to be demanding or you'll end up with the last cut of steak that could have been tossed in the trash. 

I am considering trying the place again, because I hear too many good things to have had this many bad experiences.  When I do go, I'll know exactly what I want before I get there.
