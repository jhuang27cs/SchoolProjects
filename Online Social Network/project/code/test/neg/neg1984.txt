Decided to take a day off work for some me-time and came here to get lunch with the bf. I've been here once for their pitcher margaritas, which was great, so this review is mainly focused on the food. Looked at the menu and didn't really see anything I really want. We sat at the bar section and the lady didn't notice us for a long time! Finally she came by and gave us our chips and salsa, which was very good, and I think that was the best part of the meal.

They don't have lunch specials, which kinda sucked since it was a weekday and I wanted something that was reasonable priced. I got the taquitos and enchiladas plate. It was alright, but I definitely had way better Mexican food before. 

Overall, there's no wow factor that makes me want to go back. I paid the bill and left unsatisfied and $20 bucks poorer.
