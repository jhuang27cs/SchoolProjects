I'm always down to try new places when they so I came here despite what I had already heard from my friends. Turns out, pretty much everything they said was true, and sadly none of it was good.

First is that it's overpriced. 2 dollars for a burger, another 2 for fries, and another 2 for drinks. They don't have combo meals. I ended up asking if they had any specials and the girl told me it's buy one get one free for the burger so I got 2 burgers, small fries, and a small drink. Came out being $10.80. Yea, I'm as confused as you are. Asked the lady how that works, she flashed my receipt at me and said it was taken off. Wouldn't even let me look at my own receipt and didn't get it when they gave me my order. That right there is a big no no.

As for the food, it wasn't all that good either. the burgers were alright, but like some of these other reviews, you can get a much better burger with more stuff on it for about the same price or cheaper at other fast food places. The fries were average. They were made fresh for me at least so that's one good thing about this place. And they do have a big sauce collection but i mean, it's mostly the basics like ketchup, mustard, bbq etc. 

The actual store is kinda dirty looking. They have like 4 tables when there's so much more space that they can use. Definitely not efficient.  They have TVs but they were not on, so not really sure what the point of that is. Don't think I'll be coming back here anymore and don't suggest others do until they fix their prices.
