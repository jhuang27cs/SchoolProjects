OMG!!!!!! Absolutely the worse auto shop ever! What kind of mechanics do they hire? Kindergartners who play the mechanic game?? Monkeys that never hop over the evolution hump? These idiots installed the wrong model alternator that eventually boiled my battery and killed the car!!!!!!!! Towed my car to this place, subsequently to the one in Hollywood and the one in Downtown and NONE OF THESE CHIMPS found out why my car kept dying. Finally took my VW to Jomag Auto in Silverlake, and within 3 minutes the owner fingered out the problem. Only because the alternator was under the warranty, I wouldn't have gone back to this place ever again. Please people avoid this place at all costs!!!! After spending 600 bucks, I had to come back to this place 6 times within a month. That is bullsh#t
