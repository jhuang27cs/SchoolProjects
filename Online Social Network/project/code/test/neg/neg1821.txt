Been here several times, and have never been impressed. It will keep you from starving, but not much else. 

Breakfast is better than lunch or dinner, but I am puzzled that in a hippy town like Carrboro they do not have tofu scramble or something vegan friendly. Back in the day I tried their huevos rancheros, and they are ok, but the eggs seemed old. Their grits are pretty bad...there is little difference between them and wall paper paste.

I have had their burrito for lunch...unremarkable. 

I honestly have no idea why people go here...I guess cuz its kid friendly? Elmo's folks, if you read these reviews, I implore you to check out Early Girl Eatery in Asheville. You would do well to take a page (or 100) out of their book.
