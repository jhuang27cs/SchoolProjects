I hate this place.  I've been dragged there many times by college friends.  It's filthy and greasy and the floor is always covered with sloshed drinks.  The place is packed so tight with frat boys and sloppy-drunk girls it's hard not to get in a fight just trying to get to the disgusting bathroom.  

I don't know why people go here.  Unless they want to get super drunk on awful beer and accidentally sleep with someone hideous and immature.
