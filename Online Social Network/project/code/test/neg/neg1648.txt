Just speaking to the floral side of things, I went in today looking for a nice potted flower thing fit for a balcony (as a present to my girlfriend).  After reading the reviews on here, I expected this place to be amazing.  When I got there, I was a bit underwhelmed by the flower selection, especially the potted/ in basket selection.  In addition, when I walked in, I was only told by one girl "tell us if you need anything" as she rushed to the back, and that was the last time I saw anyone.  After walking around looking for something that fit my needs for awhile, and not having anyone approach me or come out of the back to help, I ended up leaving without buying anything.  I'm not trying to be a complainer here, but when you're just sort of addressed out of the corner of someone's eye as they are running to the back to work on something, and then ignored for the next ten minutes, you don't feel very wanted as a customer.  I understand they probably get a lot of big orders from weddings and such, but I still don't feel that is any reason to ignore an individual customer.
