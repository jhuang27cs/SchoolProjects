The food is only mediocre in my opinion (Why are there pecans in the Sklarmaggedon? Pecans taste weird in an omelette.), and the decor/atmosphere is a little too zany and family friendly for me. It made me remember why I usually avoid places with strollers parked outside.

This is a good place to go if you're really into diners or you have a lot of young children with you. Unattended screaming toddlers are par for the course here.
