SAD to write this, how can you go from 5 stars to 1? How? Well by serving a vegetarian meat and not giving a shit that you did. 
My husband and I ordered the same meal we always do, on a Monday night. It was dead. We spoke clearly. We emphasized ( as always) no meat please, we are vegetarian. 
I begin eating, and my husband looks at me, and announces that we have meat in our dish! I understand mistakes happen, but for people who have spent years refusing to put meat into their bodies, and then having it forced upon them for no reason other than pure laziness is inexcusable to me. 
They gave us a huge attitude, and a refund, but they money means nothing to me. You can't change the fact that you put meat in my dish.
