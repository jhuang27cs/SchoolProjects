So, I have mixed feelings about this place. My bootcamp instructor, suggested I go to this place to buy new shoes, because my old ones were hurting my arch. I read reviews and they were all raving about Fleet Feet, so I go there with pretty high expectations. Once inside, I get an employee who seemed pretty indifferent to my condition. He was nice, but there was no enthusiasm, no pep. I just thought that was his personality, but in walks another person (he appeared to know her) and his face lights up. I was peeved by this, If I wanted customer service this lakadaisical I could have gone to Academy. 

Besides the customer service issue, the shoe selection was pretty good. But the shoes will cost you a pretty penny. 

BTW I did buy a pair of Mizuno wave rider 14.
