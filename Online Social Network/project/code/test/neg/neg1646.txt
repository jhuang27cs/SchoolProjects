My friend and I were treated SO rudely at this restaurant! The girl at the counter was a snobby little ****! She gave us dirty looks the whole time and took FOREVER. We stopped in to check the place out and grab a pastry. It's a pastry sitting there inside the refrigerated shelf and all she has to do is HAND it to me. She's not busy and there is also another girl behind the counter. For some reason it takes her about 5 MINUTES to serve me my pastry, an eclair. It was also really pricey so I expected it to be good. It was thoroughly mediocre and actually tasted like it had been previously frozen, not freshly baked, it was chilled and really cold, the custard inside was mediocre. 

For that price and the attitude of the servers I don't even need to sit down for an actual meal to give this place ONE STAR. 

Sorry to say this, but I got the feeling if your rich and white they'll treat you nice! If not, then they'll be totally rude!!
