Service is slow, but I don't think it's anybody's fault, since it does take time to freshly fry anything. But given I had to wait a long time and there was nobody else, I just wonder what it's like when there's a line?

My main gripe about OG Tempura Truck, besides its high prices, is that the tempura batter is too heavy and greasy. Fish n' chips and fried desserts are not the same as frying tempura battered vegetables and shrimp. My guess is that the oil isn't hot enough, so that my vegetables were completely saturated in oil. Then, probably because I'd been standing there for quite some time already, my mixed tempura order wasn't properly drained on paper towels, so that the grease dripped down into the (decorative, but meant to be edible?) bed of fried vermicelli.
