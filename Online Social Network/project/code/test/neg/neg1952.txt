The single star is for the friendly service. The sushi was TERRIBLE!!! I ordered a Red Dragon, specialty roll with spicy tuna inside and tuna on top. The fish was flavorless and the roll was just plain sloppy (uneven slices and sushi rice had no flavor). I should have walked out when I saw the non-traditional (Old wise Asian Male) chef behind the bar.

The people who rate this place anything else other then bad either have never had good sushi or need their taste buds checked. Not only is the sushi bad but its pricey. Save yourself the trouble and find another place for Sushi. No on NOZUMI !!!
