Went to India Samraat for my roommate's birthday. We were having a great time, the food was very good. When we got up to leave, my friend felt something on his foot. He looked down and realized he had stepped in one of the glue mouse traps that was apparently under the table. We tried to get it off his shoe but those things are tough! We called the manager over to let him know. While he was apologetic, he refused to reimburse my friend for his now ruined shoes. We had already paid and the manager did not offer any sort of compensation. No one wants a glaring reminder that there could be mice in the restaurant....and could be caught under the table at which you were just eating!! Something should have been done. We won't be going back there.
