* Note that this is from a production stand point, not a guest POV *

The shrine is a historical building with a lot of great stories, but if you want to put an event on in this place then you're looking to spend a pretty penny on expenses. 

ie. 
The AC that they have in the Expo hall can only handle half of the expo hall, so if you want it to be comfortable (72 degrees) then you have to pump AC in from an outside source. Also their production offices for the production company are less than adequate, with power problems, no ac, and doors that you have to turn sideways to go through. 

Another negative are the dressing rooms, they have 16 rooms stage left, all, except 2, have no ventilation or air conditioning. Some of the rooms don't even have outlets. 

The only part of this location that is nice is the lobby and the stage. Beautifully decorated and it definitely feels like a place that has seen many great performances. 

Note it's a IATSE local 33 house so if you want to put a show on here then you have to be willing to pay the Local wages. 

I've worked on about 6 shows here and everytime I remind myself, why do we do the show here? 

So if you want to enjoy an event in the expo hall, only use the bottom and definitely pay for the AC, and if you want to put on a great show on stage, then use theirs its great. 

The stage is the only thing that makes this location worth it. 

So if you can get tickets or be a seat filler for a show here you'll enjoy the show!
