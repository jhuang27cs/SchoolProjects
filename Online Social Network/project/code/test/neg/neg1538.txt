When I eat a Greek Chicken Lemon soup with artichokes, orzo, and garbanzo beans, I want all of the flavors of the ingredients. I want to taste chicken. I want to taste artichokes. I want the taste and texture of orzo pasta. The garbanzos should add a light flavor. And a little lemon should permeate all of the flavors.

The soup I had today had only one flavor, and I can't place it. The chicken tasted like the artichokes which tasted like the orzo which tasted like the garbanzos, and all of it was bland. There wasn't even a hint of lemon. It was as if the entire soup were thrown into a blender, pureed, and somehow molded back into the shapes and textures of the ingredients.

They call the sandwiches they serve "half sandwiches". It's more like a one-inch-wide slice of a sandwich for $3.75. One "half sandwich" is at the same time more than you'd ever want to eat (because it's so bad) and definitely not enough to satisfy even the lightest eater. I'm pretty sure the bread was made last Wednesday. That might've been okay on Thursday morning, but today is Sunday.

As Jenna said, they do offer a special where if you buy soup and a half sandwich, they take a little bit off the price. What they don't tell you is that if you buy soup and two half sandwiches, they don't give you the special price. So I ended up paying over $14 for a really bad and tiny meal.

I gave a second star because they serve Coca-Cola products, not Pepsi.
