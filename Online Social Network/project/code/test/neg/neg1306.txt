Amazingly mediocre.

It looks great, the staff is fast and friendly, the clientele upscale, the menu and ambience inviting.

I started with a strawberry lemonade ($3.50) and was very encouraged due to its flavorful potency and fresh ingredients.

But then there was the food. I liked that they had a "Delux Halfer" for $10.95 that came with soup, salad and half a sandwich (from the admittedly limited "sandwich board" list).

I thought the Pork Tortilla soup sounded good, but it was bland and missing texture.

The tuna salad sandwich (on rosemary bread) was made with care as was the salad with creamy italian and beets, but everything was just so uninteresting.

Pity.
