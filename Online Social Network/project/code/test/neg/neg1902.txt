I had a mango lassi, the buffet, and spent the rest of the day praying to the porcelain diety.

Im sorry. The proximity of this place to campus means that you need to take the other reviews with a hefty grain of salt. The food here is typically  not fresh, oily, and of poor quality.  Students seem to like anything that they didn't get in their home town growing up, but as indian food goes, this place is poor.  I have watched the quality steadily decline over the last several years, and the last time i went was for a candidate interview visit, so i had to go since i was on the interview schedule for lunch, i was physically ill for a day with food poisoning.

I will never go back.

Students continue to eat there, and thats fine with me.
