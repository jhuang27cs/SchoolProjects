The Borders Books & Music at Providence Place Mall is pretty much like any Borders anywhere in the country: large and spacious with a decent selection, good hours, all the bestsellers you could ask for, and tchotchkes aplenty. The Pacific Northwest native in me is happy to see the Seattle's Best Coffee housed within this particular location, and I would most likely stop here if I felt like braving the mall and needed to pick up a specific book as a gift. Still, shopping for books at Borders is not nearly as satisfying as poking around other downtown locations like Cellar Stories or Symposium. If you're not after any particular book, head elsewhere.
