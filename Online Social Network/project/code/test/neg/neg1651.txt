Run by people who seem to know very little about running a nightclub.

First, I showed up at 1:30 with 6 people.  Went to the door, said I wanted a table, and would buy a bottle - the dude at the door said there was a 2 bottle minimum.  I politely told the people at the door that I wasn't buying two bottles, for 6 people, for a club that was only open for another 1.5 hours.  That's when the dude at the door said, with a dollop of arrogance, than "they had Nelly".  I again, politely, reminded him that Nelly was a washed up rapper from the 90's and shouldn't garner any sort of premium.  Instead I walked 5 feet away, and went in through the normal line, with no cover.  When I got in, most of the tables were empty...good job guys, you missed an opportunity to fill a table, and sell a bottle, because you "had Nelly".  Beat.

Second, I'm not sure why anyone would ever think it's a good idea to have a night geared solely towards a single race or culture, but apparently the brainiacs at Reign came up with this one too, as it turned out to be Asian night.  No problem with this, just an observation of marketing at the hands of fools.

Third, the crowd was just really quite poor.  There was the guy in cargo shorts and flip flops arguing with the dude at the door about "dress codes" (clearly more emblematic of Atlanta than this venue).  Second, there was the table with a girl so drunk she was passed out along the booth.  Third, there was the table with a short stocky little gal who would verbally reprimand and physically intimidate anyone who came within an invisible perimeter of her table.  I'm not sure what this chick thought she had purchased, when she bought the table, but apparently she thought it came with air rights.  It actually made for some great entertainment...

This was the last stop of the night, so the lameness turned out not to be too terrible of a thing.  However, I'm not sure I would ever consider making this place the focus of my evening anytime soon...
