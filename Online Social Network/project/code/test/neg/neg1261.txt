I live in Harlem and was very disheartened to learn that Max won't deliver to Harlem at night unless you're a regular customer.  I guess they're still mired in old, racist ways.  When I called from my cell phone and gave them my address, they told me they don't deliver "to the other side of the park."  It was only after I gave them my home number, which they apparently had on file, that they changed their minds.  For shame.

On another note, don't ever get the "wine of the month" specials.  Each time I've tried it, the wine had gone bad--seems it's just an excuse to clear out the boxes of vinegar they've kept by their radiators.
