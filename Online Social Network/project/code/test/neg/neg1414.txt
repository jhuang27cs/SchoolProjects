Words alone fail to express my contempt for Tom's. Maybe words, plus bile, real bile, might suffice. I have given them three chances to redeem themselves, since I moved into the neighborhood for school 4 months ago, and this is my closest diner.  I'd really prefer this place be better.

But it's not. Everything is wrong:

1.) Even with plenty of table seating available off-peak, they insist on trying to seat you at the bar, then eventually give in after a struggle.
2.) The waitresses are horrible, nasty harpies.  I am not exaggerating.  See for your yourself.  They are self-parodies, unbelievable to watch.
3.) The coffee is weak, sour, and arrives with a greasy scum on its surface.
4.) The food is crap.  They can't do anything on a plate right.  And no, I'm not going to give their milkshakes a chance: I'm not there for the "experience," I'm trying to get a meal.
5.) Beware your pace of eating: you have 5 minutes after your last bite to vacate.  I'm not joking, I was told that on my first two visits.

The decor is filed with Seinfield-related kitsch, and the staff seems to be well aware that they have a steady stream of sucker tourists ready to be treated like crap - and fed crap - for the privilege of being able to say "I ate at the Seinfield diner!"  

I fervently pray this place goes out of business and a real diner take its place.
