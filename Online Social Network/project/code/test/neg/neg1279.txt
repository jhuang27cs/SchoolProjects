I'm sure it's not bad for the neighborhood, but I couldn't get into it. I went for breakfast/brunch a couple times and found the place to be average both times and a bit overpriced for what it is. It's cutesy and homey and folksy and all that so if you're into that kind of stuff, this is your place.
