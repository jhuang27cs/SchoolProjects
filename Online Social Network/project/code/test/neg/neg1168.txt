Hahahaha, this was a unique experience. The person who manages or owns the place is rude, abrupt, and clearly could careless what you think about his gruff attitude. Now this could be his schtick (Soup Nazi character from Seinfeld) and had the pizza been to die for, I would have ignored him and his bark, but the pizza was meh...Of course after just spending a few days in NY and experiencing some incredible pizza, it may have made me a bit of a pizza snob. I had the spinach, mozz, garlic slice. Oh baby there was garlic, but flat tasting. Hubs, was just as unimpressed with his slice of pepperoni/cheese...flavorless.
