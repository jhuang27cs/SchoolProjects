I am trying to change doctors because the physician I currently have has an awful office staff. On the recommendation of a friend I tried to make an appointment with Dr. Perlman. Unfortunately, I was unable to speak with a live person - only the weird computerized voicemail system - and never got a call back when I left a message. That's a big red flag for me that the office staff at Dr. Perlman's is not that great either.
