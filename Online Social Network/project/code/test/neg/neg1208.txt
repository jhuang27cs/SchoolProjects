Good coffee. I had the pretzel bread with cheese and the barrista toasted it for me. Great late-afternoon snack. 

Hipster spot, great people watching, yeah yeah yeah. HOWEVER, the place was full of flies and I couldn't relax and slowly savor my snack because I was too busy shoo-ing the flies away.  I really could not come back here....it just felt too dirty.
