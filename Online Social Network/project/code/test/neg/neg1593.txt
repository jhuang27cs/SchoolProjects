Honest to goodness, my high school science teacher used to make us go here for extra credit. I can't remember why he made us eat there, but if we were doing science experiments (test the food perhaps?) that probably should have tipped me off.
Met up with some friends, who for whatever reason wanted to watch the King's game there. I personally hadn't been there since high school and remembered not liking it, but couldn't remember why. After all, it has a kind-of old school cool decor and has been a Pasadena Institution for years. That day would be a reminder.
First service. Staff seemed to be annoyed by our presence. Granted, it was a large group, but that's good for business right? When someone asked if an extra check was possible, the waitress basically berated them. I think the whole time we were there, she maybe smiled once, when we could find her.
As for the food, I'm just not impressed. I can tell you - do not order the veggie burger. It is perhaps the worst I've had. If this were 10 years ago, sure, you could get away with a lousy vegburger, but that particular design has come a long, long way. The hummus was meh, as was the tabbouleh and the salad bar was just whatever. 
I'm not sure I'd go back again - even for extra credit.
