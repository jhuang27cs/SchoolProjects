30 minutes to get two breakfast burritos to go :-|. The burritos were OK. One was chicken tikka masala and the other was bacon, but they both tasted like potato burritos. Someone said this place has the best mango lassi's...are you serious? The two I ordered were incredibly tart and thin. I was really hoping this place was great too, :-/.
