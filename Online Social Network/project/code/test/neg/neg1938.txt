A friend and myself went here a few nights ago to grab some grub on a Monday night.
It happened to be karaoke night (which was pretty entertaining), but it was NOT very busy when we arrived.
There were about 5 people sitting at the bar, we sat at a table and there were maybe 3 other tables on the main level.
I have no idea what was "upstairs", but it wasn't crazy busy.

Our waitress, though a really nice girl, didn't take very good care of us.
She got our sodas (and we only got sodas--no liquor/beer) and she gave us menus.
She was friendly, but we were ready to order shortly after and we didn't see her again for 21 minutes, just as we were going to leave!

She did apologize for that and took our order.
I ordered the Artichoke SpinDip and my friend ordered a Turkey Sandwich and some onion rings...

45 minutes pass by.
Yes... 45 minutes, and NO food OR waitress.

She came by at that point to apologize for our food taking so long and assured us that she would "take care of [us]" on the bill to compensate for the slow food service.

Finally our food came out, and everything was pretty good.  It wasn't anything to write home about, but it was good.  I'd get the spin dip again!

Anyhow, the waitress did try to take care of our bill and she also gave us two drink chips for the trouble, too, but she was a very avoidy with us, and that didn't help the service recovery any.

All in all, she did her best on service recovery, but since this is nowhere in my normal stomping ground, I won't make a point of returning and I also won't choose this spot the next time I'm in Shadyside.


PROS:  
In the heart of Shadyside on Walnut St.
Full Bar/Full Menu

CONS:
Service was "meh...", at best.
Bathrooms are downstairs and pretty rough
