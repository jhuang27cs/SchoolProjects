I went here for lunch recently and was very excited as I'd heard good things about Jujube. This was my first trip and was also stoked to see numerous vegetarian options on their menu. Unfortunately Jujube did not deliver.

I would say the food that I had (Vegetarian Kung Pao Chicken) was nothing more than PF Chang quality. The people whom I ate with got a variety of dishes from sandwiches, crepes & beef salad. Everyone agreed that their food was mediocre. Maybe lunch is not where Jujube shines?

On the plus side its a small, stylish dining environment and has a nice little outdoor seating area to the side. Also, the service was decent. The highlight of our trip here was that one server has dreads that are 5 feet long..and i'm not kidding. He should be in Ripley's Believe it or Not.
