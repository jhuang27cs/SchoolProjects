The women here are super pushy. I ducked in one day because it was really cold outside and I wanted to warm up a bit (and check out new fragrances). I was barely in the store for 10 seconds before a woman came up to me telling me she had the perfect thing for my hair. She grabs my hand and leads me over to the Douglas brand hair care products. Before I knew it, she was spraying things in my hair and commenting on how lively and shiny it looked now. All I felt was greasiness. When I politely inferred that I wasn't interested, she kept saying, "It's European!" and "This product comes from GERMANY," as if these statements would make me change my mind about the greasy residue the product left in my hair. I ended up scurrying out of the store back into the cold of winter. I guess I won't be using this store as a pit-stop to achieve warmth anymore.
