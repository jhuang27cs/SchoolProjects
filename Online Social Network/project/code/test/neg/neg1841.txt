First of all - if you like a healthy dose of attitude with your food this is the place. Guys behind the counter really didn't care and acted like they were doing us a favor. [Um-excuse me but this is your job---at least pretend like you are there to serve customers].

Second of all hot dogs do not need a brioche bun. Too sweet.

Third of all-- what you get for the price is really, really overrated

So disappointed, won't likely be back
