I am a big fan of Round Table Pizza but this particular franchise leaves a lot to be desired.  It's unfortunate because they are located on the UCSD campus in the middle of Price Center near a ton of other competing restaurants and food places and they don't really stand out.  The quality of their food compared to other Round Table locations in San Diego is very poor.   You can tell they use way less toppings on the pizza than other stores and the pizza sizes/slices are smaller in general.  What's with not having a salad bar, and charging $5 for a little tray of greens? $.75 for a little cup of ranch is crazy!  They make you pay for what other Round Table's give away...    

I do like that they deliver on campus, but I think there is a minimum order price for that

+ 1 star for having beer on campus, and +1 for a place to watch sports on TV

Please fix the food!!!
