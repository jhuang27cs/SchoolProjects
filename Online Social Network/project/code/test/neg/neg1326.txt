If you are looking for a high end steakhhouse .do no come here .if however you are looking for an upscale fridays this is your place ..I will preface this by saying I've been to many top steakhouses in my time and was looking toward to checking this place out buy it failed on many levels 

1. the place needed a real freshen up. The carpets were dirty and the ceiling was covered in garbage bags (apparently they were in the midst of a fix up which is no excuse ).overall the feel was not there and the seating was cramped and I go knocked about a dozen times by waiters that should know better 
Overall the feel was low.level 

2 service . If I pay 500 dollars for.a meal for.my family of five.(two Young Kids)
I expect expert service ...drinks filled without asking etc ...it just was not there

3 food  the  food was.very good bit not exceptional and my steak was not on the medium side of medium.rare ...not.happy and the app portions were weak -- i orderd 4 app and it was just not enough ?!?! the calamari was not emough to share and was mailnly breading

Overall I give it.a 2 for trying to pass this off as real steakhouse
