I took my Hubby here to get both of us pedicures. The salon is clean, great pedicure stations, the ones with the nice comfy massage chairs and nice jet tubs. That's where the good ends! For $25 they barely spent 15 minutes on our feet, and the place was empty! They only used the cuticle cutter and a pumice like stone to scrub the deadskin. No cutting, triming, filing or shaping of the nails. No time taken to remove the deadskin from the feet. No base coat, 2 coats of polish and a top coat. I came home and still had cracked heels. I had to file off my own deadskin. Ive paid less and gotten better service, Needless to say they won't be seeing me again.
