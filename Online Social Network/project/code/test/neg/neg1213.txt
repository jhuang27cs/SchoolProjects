This place was AWFUL. I went with a group of friends after visiting Columbia. The food was crappy, psuedo-"traditional"-Chinese, and the service was horrendous. I had the wonton soup noodles with roasted pork. The broth was both extremely bland and very greasy. The wontons and the roast pork were pretty flavorless. The actual waiter who served us was very nice, until it came time to pay the bill. 

He (very nicely) told us that they couldn't split the check. We were trying to figure out how to divide the bill when a female staff member (maybe a manager?) came over and started waving the bill in our faces and yelling at us about how we couldn't split the bill. I ended up putting it all on my card. After we purposely left a shitty tip, she actually followed us out of the restaurant onto Broadway and demanded an explanation! We told her we didn't tip servers who were as unpleasant and mean as she had been. She started yelling at us again and told us not to ever come back! 

Terrible, terrible experience. Expensive, sub-par food, insane staff. I'll stick to Chinatown for good noodles.
