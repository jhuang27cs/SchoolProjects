Ewwwww. If you want vegetarian/vegan food, please walk to Life Alive near Central Square.

Our office decided to get Veggie Galaxy for takeout and I think we were all disappointed. I got the smoked reuben and I couldn't take anything except for the horseradish mayo. Every bite I took was like eating a spoonful of mustard. Same goes to my friend's grilled cheese sandwich. The onion rings were uncooked on the inside and covered with this gross, oily, soggy nastiness. 

In conclusion, come here if you like mustard. And grease.
