I was going to give it one star, but I'm going to give it leeway to account for the raging headache I had and the fact that it was a busy Friday night and they had a private party in the back.

but the ambiance is so weird....especially in the bar...there's the fireplace (yes!) and it's real (double yes!) and there's a lot of colonial-esque americana...and then there's the stainless steel and white flourescent modern bar and bar lighting....super weird combo.

the service took literally FOREVER

the food was ok but not great- they messed up my order and then took a long, long time to fix it

all-in-all-- meh.
