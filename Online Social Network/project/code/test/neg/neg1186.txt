I'll be honest..I haven't been here in a couple years, but that's the reason for the 1star rating.

Back in college I went a few times. But as many people have said, the service is absolutely horrible. I'm in the boat like the others that have had the manager chase you outside to try and pressure you into giving tip. 

Many of my friends have experienced the same thing. "Why didn't you tip? Don't you know all the servers working here are college students?" Well..we were college students ourselves at the time. And you shouldn't treat your customers so crappy. Maybe then will people tip.

Food was slow coming out, water was never refilled, the place was dirty. If I can remember all the negatives from this place, then it has to be 1star.

This is one of those boycott for life places.
