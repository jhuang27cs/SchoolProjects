I'm lucky enough that I live off campus and don't HAVE to go to this post office. The lady that works here is such a b****. She has one of the poorest attitudes I've seen and it's obvious she hates her job. Why? Because when I was filling out my envelope she kept saying to her co-worker, "Come OOONNN, five o'clock! Come OOONNNN, five o'clock!" Have some professionalism... I've worked in customer service before and I know what it's like to have rude/annoying customers and hate your job, but I've always put on a good attitude, which made work a lot better. If the lady actually tried to do her job and actually be helpful, I can guarantee she would not be so miserable. Luckily, the post office on Villa La Jolla (in the Whole Foods plaza) always has wonderful service from all of the employees. I think I'll write a review on that one next to balance out this angry one...
My recommendation: If you live off campus, don't go here!
