I only give Azumi Sushi 2 stars but it is a restaurant I return to occassionally.

Sushi - Not bad... just not what you would find in a sit-down sushi restaurant. This is basically a fast-food sushi restaurant.

Food - Fresh. Temperature is good. Presentation is good.
Atmosphere - Too crowded.
Service - Too slow... advice - go to the front of the line and listen to the cashier. If he/she keeps calling out to the kitchen, "how much longer on the katsu?" then order something else. Wait times can be slow.

Worth the trip but not worth writing home about.
