"Pu Pu is the sh!t."  That's what my friend said before we entered the restaurant.  I think it ought to be changed to "Pu Pu's food is ...."  Well, Ino need to complete the phrase as I think the one star speaks for itself.

When we arrived at Pu Pu, we were greeted by the owner (perhaps?) YELLING on the phone at a customer.  From what I could gather, it was about a take-out order gone wrong.  He called the customer "stupid" probably without realizing that he hadn't hung up the phone.  Soon after, I hear "Ok, that wasn't a nice thing to say."  What the heck?  O_o???  I think that may be the first cue to leave...  But alas, I was hungry and wanted to try the food.

The cuisine at Pu Pu is most definitely Americanized (hence, my review may be very biased as I like the more authentic Chinese food).  I ordered seafood pan fried noodles.  They're nothing like the one's I've seen in other Chinese restaurants.  Instead of using egg noodles, they used the same noodles for lo mein.  Pan fry = charred to non-perfection.  The topping was okay with not so much seafood.  Eh, for $7.45, what can you expect?

If you are in the Cambridge area near Central, I'd recommend going to Mary Chung's.  If you're closer to the Kendall area, I'd recommend Mulan Taiwanese.
