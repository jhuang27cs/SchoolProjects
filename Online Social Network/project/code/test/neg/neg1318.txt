The service was the only good thing about this place, but even that wasn't great as the server lied to me. She told me the crab cakes were small (oh yes they were) but they were all crab and no filler. Umm, what's this corn and scallion then? The two teeny fried crabcakes were basically all filler and the arugula salad they came with (wish I would have known as I started with a ceaser salad) was way too salty.  My husband's turkey burger was okay but nothing special. 

Everything was overpriced for the quality. Two beers, crab cakes, a salad and a turkey burger came out to $45. Not worth it.
