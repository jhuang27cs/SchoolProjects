I wish I read the reviews on this place before even considering it. I was looking for a place on New Years day for a late breakfast. I wanted to go to the Breakfast Club but the line was out the door. We decided to go to Cambridge cause I remembered I wanted to try Sunny's or there would be more options. So we see that Sunny's was closed and across the street we see a banner that reads "breakfast all day". We knew that was it after a couple hungry strikes

We enter a tiny little run down shop and there is no one around. Then a woman comes out with no smile and I asked for breakfast and she goes ok, sit wherever you want. The whole vibe was shady but we were starving and thought ok lets just do this. 

I decided to with the eggs, homefries, and toast. My bf gets the spinach and feta omlette. 

We were waiting to hear the breakfast being made, and its silent for like 10 minutes, then we notice she is back and an egg cracks. Okkkay. We sit sipping bad coffee and dusty hookahs sit in front of us. 

The food finally comes out. It was so thoughtlessly prepared, but I wasn't surprised. My "scrambled" eggs came out more like a crepe, flat and crispy.  Toast obviously burnt and homefries came with 5 potato pieces tasting like fish. Bf's omlette was tiny and just blah. Bacon was undercooked and we sent it back.

When we went to pay at the register (prices were only a couple bucks and it was useless to complain since we would never return) we noticed the back was filthy. Just don't bother!
