We had an awful experience here.  We made a reservation for a big party weeks in advance and by the day of, they lost our reservation.  When we arrived, the service took forever and the food was mediocre at best.  (The kids thought that the fruit salad was salty.)  It was 1:00 in the afternoon (they open at 10) and they were out of many menu items, including cupcakes, which was fairly disastrous since we were at the restaurant to celebrate a birthday.  The service was snotty and unhelpful.  I will definitely not dine here again.
