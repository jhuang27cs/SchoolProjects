You know, the idea of two freshly baked cookies with ice cream in the middle sounds so appealing.  But this place really isn't for me.  The sandwich is just too decadent and heavy.  I feel like crap after having eaten it.  The ice cream itself is Dreyers, so it's decent, but it's not great.  For the price, I think it's a great deal.  But it's just not my thing (though I love cookies and ice cream.

Sometimes I go here and ask for one cookie and one scoop of ice cream and then I eat them separately.  It costs the same as if I got the sandwich, but really, it's under $2, so I'm not going to complain.

Generally, I avoid this place even though it is right in my neighborhood.
