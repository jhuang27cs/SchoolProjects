Yeah, most aesthetic things and environmental factors surrounding this store suck, as is adequately covered in reviews

But this is not my biggest problem. Does anyone realize how much stuff costs here?? You can recognize their absurd markup when stuff goes on sale like 92% off.

You'd probably spend less grocery shopping at Pike Place Market. Safeway has to have the worst value-per-dollar of any grocery store I am aware of (with the possible exception of QFC, which costs more but is owned by the same conglomerate - ie same suppliers different packaging).

Its not like there aren't other stores nearby. Any student whose little rational economic man allows them to shop here should not be allowed to graduate.
