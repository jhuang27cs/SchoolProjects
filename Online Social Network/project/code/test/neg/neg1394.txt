Coming from California, I have pretty high expectations when it comes to Mexican food, but Tios is EXCEPTIONALLY bad. This place makes Chevy's seem authentic.

I was REALLY disappointed by my meal there. I tried a bite of my friend's burrito at "Taste of Ann Arbor" and though it wasn't very good I thought it might just be the circumstances and having heard it was the "best Mexican in Ann Arbor" I thought I'd give it another chance. Now I can say, without a doubt it is the WORST Mexican I've ever had.

A few points that really put it over the edge:

1) No free chips and salsa (come one, what Mexican restaurant doesn't provide that)

2) We ordered a side of chips and salsa. They may as well have been potato chips because the tortilla chips they served as were no where close to authentic.

3) The cheese in my burrito wasn't even melted.

4) They charged my husband for a refill on his soft drink. What is this Europe? Where in the US do you still have to pay for refills? Tios, apparently.

5) The service was terrible. I asked twice for a a box and the waitress didn't discount my husbands tacos (it was taco Tuesday).

6) The place SMELLS. Not in the good Mexican food way, but in the bad overused oil. I had to take a shower when I got home.

I will not be returning to Tios.
