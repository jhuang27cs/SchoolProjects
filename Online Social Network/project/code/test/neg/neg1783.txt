Used them to cater a birthday party for my one year old and have to say that I was 
kinda disappointed with the food. The rice balls were super bland and almost no one ate them so we ended up throwing them out and the mac and cheese bits just tasted cold and mushy also pretty much threw them out after the party. Debbie the lady I placed my order with never got in touch with me to see how everything went after the party.. Would have saved money by just getting a bunch of appetizers at costo.
