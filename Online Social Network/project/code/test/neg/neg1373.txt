This place, man I really wanted to like it. I have tried it three times. Each time it got worse. Once it was good a few weeks ago they had a new kid there, 1st time I went there it was just OK, but fairly new, Its fried chicken, it should be full of flavor. this last time which promoted me to write a review, the chicken had absolutely no seasoning. NONE I was so disappointed. We spent $15 buck on lame chicken and really really strange fries. They were a weird color, soft and not good. The wife and I tried hot sauce, salt, just eating the skin. Nothing, I really was excited about this place because who doesn't love fried chicken.  I am sorry but it is not good. Damn I am really upset about it too.
