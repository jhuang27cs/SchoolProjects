Most of the time I would give their food about 2.5 stars. Mediocre quality and flavor. Sometimes it is pretty decent, but it is so inconsistent I could never give it more than 3 stars.

What has really started to annoy me about Ray's though is how early they close up and stop making food. This has happened to me several times, but last night I went in at 10:25 and they said they were closed and there was absolutely no food that I could purchase, despite their posted closing time of 11pm. I could understand closing up early if it was 10:40 and no one was there, but several tables had people at them and it was more than half an hour before when they were supposed to close.
