I have ordered from this restaurant for 4+ years and have had a few complaints over the years. Every complaint one makes is treated with hostility and instead of being apologetic and correcting the mistake, they blame the customer! A few nights ago, I ordered my wings extra crispy, super well done. The order taker, Ruby, repeated my exact order back to me, but when the wings arrived they were soft and sticky, clearly under cooked. I put them in stove and cooked them further. An hour or so later, I ended up vomiting. When I called the restaurant, Ruby said, "we thought they would be too dry if we cooked them more." They ignore your requests. Further, my food  has arrived at times with staples in it or hair, etc. I think it is time to say farewell. They should appreciate their customers more. We are not at fault for requesting that our food is prepared a certain way. Isn't that their job??
