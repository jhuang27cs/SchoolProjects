After an unsuccessful trip to Sprinkles (seriously, is it worth all the hype and crazy lines?) Hubster and I moseyed down the street to check out the new Kara's. We'd been to the Ghiradelli Square location previously and thought the cupcakes were pretty good.

There was no line when we got there but still ended up waiting for about 10 minutes for someone to help us. The girl behind the counter was obviously new and was incapable of quickly helping a customer and she had no one else helping her.

We ordered: Fleur de Sel, Raspberry Dazzle, Vanilla Chocolate, Chocolate Chocolate, Carrot Cake and Myer Lemony Lemon and took them to my parent's house to share. The unanimous opinion was that there was way too much frosting on all of them and the cake was subpar. Taste wise they just weren't all that. And certainly not worth the cost.
