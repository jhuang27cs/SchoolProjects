I'm not sure why anyone would come here as opposed to the other Coupa on campus (by Green Library) - it's about a dollar per item more on average, and although the selection is a little bigger (notably they have arepas here and not at the other one), the food tastes about the same or even worse.  
This location has indoor seating, although it's very crowded and at the lunch rush you'll have to wait awhile to order and get your food.  My boyfriend's turkey panini came out pretty promptly.  He said the first half was pretty good, but the second half was absolutely soaked in a spicy mustard sauce that squirted all over him when he bit into the sandwich.  He said it overpowered the sandwich, and he wished it had been more evenly distributed between the two halves.    
My nutella pancakes took forever to come out.  Finally, after my boyfriend was DONE eating his panini, he went and investigated and got them brought out to us.  They were pretty cold, so it was clear they had been sitting awhile.  Other than the temperature, they were pretty good, although I'm not sure paying 50 extra cents for nutella was worth it (just a small dab of nutella on top of the stack).  But there were 3 pancakes and they were decent-sized, so I didn't feel ripped off.  
Come here if you want arepas or are set on sitting indoors - otherwise the other location on campus is much better - less crowded, lower prices, and comparable food.
