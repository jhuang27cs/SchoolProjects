I am so tired of hearing non-Californians compare their local burger chain to the likes to In-N-Out burger. Unless you are from California, then you probably think that I'm being a snob, but honestly, you haven't had a burger until you've had an In-N-Out burger. (Yum, freshly grilled, never-frozen patties, toasted buns, and amazing spread anyone?)

I got a Whataburger Jr. and fries. (Keep in mind that I was drunk when I ate this, and things always taste better when you've got the drunk munchies.) The bun on the burger made me feel like I got it straight out of a High School cafeteria. It was smashed, cold, and untoasted. Finish it off with sub-par meat and cheese. The fries sucked even more! Soggy, COLD, bitter tasting fries! 

The only thing that saved this place was that you could add grilled onions. Give me my San Diego Robertos/Rigobertos/Albertos/Alertos/whatevertos over this stuff anyday!
