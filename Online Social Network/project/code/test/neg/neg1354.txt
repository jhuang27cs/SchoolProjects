Located right in the garage. It was just a place we stumbled upon and being quite hungry, we picked this place. The menu was pretty simple and cheap - although not much of a selection. We ordered a burger, grilled cheese, and some buffalo wings. I was disappointed with the burger and grilled cheese. They just seemed like something I can make at home - or probably even better. The burger fell apart when i picked it up and took one bite. 

The buffalo wings had too much chicken hair/feather left on it - yuck. I had to pluck them right off before eating it. Big disappointment. I left the place with sticky fingers and a table full of crumpled napkins. The only good thing is that the wait wasn't too long, and I was able to refill my drink myself.
