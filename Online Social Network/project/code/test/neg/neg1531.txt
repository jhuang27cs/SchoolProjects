kah-blooey. can we say "downhill fast?" can i explain that this is the second time in six months i've patronized this place and had to get my own condiments? the first time, at least, we got our food comped. this time, all the kegs were blown, the computer was down (a surprise cash-only ramification followed), my food was late and medium rare a joke, fries meant, apparently, chips, and onions were as MIA as the water i asked for 3 times. saving grace? the female bartender who replaced the piteous male bartender who had the afternoon shift. i hate westwood anyway, but at least our big party had space in the back to not eat our late food and not drink the beer we wanted and not use our debit cards and have to hunt down forks like the primates we are.
