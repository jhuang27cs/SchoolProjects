So Comcast sent me another DVR in the mail. This one was actually a DVR, but it was a faulty piece of equipment. Of course, it took a week of tinkering around and waiting on hold for them to figure out that the box just wasn't working. I was told to return the box and the HD they had sent previously to a comcast office. I refused. In the end, I got them to come to my home at a time convenient for me to pick up the 2 boxes and to refund me for a month's service.
