After waiting around 10mins to get seated, which was a major fail, our waitress actually came and took out order speedily. Usually I like this Denny's and, as a Trojan Alumna, have been here a trillion times. It seems like everyone called in today or something cuz there is only one waitress for our whole section. But she's handling business. Three stars for her, none for the rest of the staff. Minus a star for the one chick in the rocawear jacket who's been frowning.

AND the last time we were here the waitress literally lied and told us she couldn't give us an extra side of croutons and onions for a salad. Like seriously? Just say "I don't feel like bringing it." At least I'll respect your honesty.
