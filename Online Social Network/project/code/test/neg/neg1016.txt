This burger bar has a lot of hype. The burgers are nothing to write home about and getting a tastier one is expensive once you include necessary add-ons. The french fries were pretty gross and do not expect to find any gluten-free options unless you like a patty on a plate. The only thing I thought was excellent was the guacamole which is worth a stop in, or maybe outside on the patio during waterfire.
