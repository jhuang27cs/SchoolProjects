Are there no good Brew Pubs in Providence?

The beer here is unremarkable.  The food is what you would expect from a establishment as Union Station, good bar food, burgers are good, dinner entrees can use some help and taste like they came out of a can or a bag.

What really did it for me was when I asked for a pitcher of a beer that had 8% ABV.  I was with two other people and I am sure the three of us could had handled four pints of 8% beer.  Restaurant policy does not allow pitchers of beer that strong to be served, so we had to order our brews pint by pint.

I am a beer drinker and 8% is not that strong.  My friends and I finished our pints and headed to Trinity.  The beer is just as bad there but at least they allow you drink pitchers that are over 8% (Oh my!).
