I consider myself a Thai cuisine connoisseur. I've been to Thailand a number of times and cook thai dishes at home.
I checked out the buffet here based on recommendations here. To be honest it was one of the worst meals I've had in my life. So please read this as a review of the buffet offered on Saturdays. Here's why I give it one star.

Dishes are overly-Americanized (sweet, saucy)
Pathetic selection of lunch foods (one rice, one noodles, 2 veggies dishes) and a soup that consisted of mushrooms floating in oil.
Extremely greasy food. The Pad Thai had almost no veggies/proteins, just a lot of greasy saucy noodles. It was also way too sweet and sticky.
There was a fried-rice that was more of the same.
Tofu in coconut curry had hardly any tofu or for that matter anything in it, it was a lot of curry ruined by copious amounts of cheap coconut cream.
The spring rolls were good but overly oily.

Honestly I'm surprised by the rankings here and wonder if some of these are fakes. I'm also guessing a significant percentage of ratings here are from Eastern WA students in the U who haven't had Thai food before. 

Finally, it's also not cheap. I spent 17.50 without tip for two here, this may sound cheap when compared to decent buffets but keep in mind the selection of items and the quality make it a bad deal.
