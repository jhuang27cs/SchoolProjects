not as great as everyone hypes it up to be. cupcakes are pretty/decorative but not moist and taste almost stale-like. wish the croissants were a bit fluffier on the inside, and the outside crust isn't soft and crispy at all. pastries are mediocre, and I only like their oatmeal raisin cookie and black/white cake. reason for low rating is bc for the vast selection that they offer, only a few things are actually good.
