I came here with 6 people and boy was that a bad idea.  We felt like sardines packed in a tiny corner.  It's only busy because it's the only semi-romantic place to take a date on the ave.  It's nice and dark with typical Indian decor and cheesy Christmas lights.  I'm an AVID Indian food eater and I know good Indian food.  The food here was not anything to write home about.  And it's too loud with all the people attempting to out shout one another.  Long story short, good for students who have no experience with Indian food.
