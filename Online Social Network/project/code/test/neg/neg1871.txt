In desperation I ventured forth to the dreaded Kendall Square Food Court today for lunch.  I went to the salad/entree place in the middle and got a bit of mac n cheese (average), chicken with rice and assorted veggies.

When I found a bone (looked like a small joint bone actually) in the chicken I lost all my appetite and threw the whole thing away. 

Add in being over-priced (they weigh everything),...don't even bother.

Sbarro has and continues to have the most blandest tasting sauced food-no flavor, everything tastes the same.

Chinese food places -meh- too greasy and not enough selection.

Au Bon Pain - safe if boring.

Why, oh why, can't Kendall get some decent places to eat!?
