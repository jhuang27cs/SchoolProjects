Had the Pad Kee Mao with beef. The beef was low-grade steak and was very chewy. The seasoning was bland and there were more bamboo shoots than noodles. The Phad Thai tasted like spaghetti o's sauce. The service was fine.(ONE STAR)  EXCEPT.... When I went to pay the lady who was playing the food took my money WITH HER GLOVES ON then went back to cutting food WITH THE SAME DIRTY GLOVES. I will be reporting this to the county.
