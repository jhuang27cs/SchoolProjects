By the time I end up here I've usually already had a few drinks in me and even that doesn't make this place any more enjoyable... Service is slow as hell, cleanliness doesn't seem like a familiar concept to management, and the food is over priced and disgusting. 

However, this place is pretty cheap when it comes to pitchers... otherwise try to avoid.
