My girlfriend and I always stop in on Monday nights because they have $2 off all bottles. (beer)  That being said, we usually have about 4 or 6 beers in total for around $10. A great deal!  We each have about 3 beers and end up only paying around $10 total. 

As of this past Monday, we will not be patronizing the Blind Pig any longer. The bartender told us they were completely out of the Weach, which is my favorite. I then ask for the apricot, which they are out of as well...keep in mind, both of these beers run about $1.50 each on Monday nights with the discount.  He then offers up a raspberry beer that he promises will be comparable to the fruit beers that they were out of.  

However, the bartender forgets to mention that the beer he suggested, which I've never heard of before was $25 per bottle!!!    How deceptive and shady!  I am clearly a regular there on Monday nights due to the cheap bottle beer...shouldn't you give the customer a "heads up" that the beer you just suggested to them was $25 a bottle?  Shady and very deceptive.  I ended up ordering his suggestion, which I hated and later found out it was $25 a bottle when I went to close my tab. Buyer beware!!!
