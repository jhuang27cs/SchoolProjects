I give this place 1 star simply because they participate in false advertising!! I am 7 months pregnant and am currently doing a lot of shopping for cribs, baby clothing and lamaze classes.  While walking around i realized I had missed my lamaze class that day! I blame it on pregnancy brain (anyone who has been pregnant knows what i'm talking about!). But i was so happy to spot this place! At first. 

Why would they name a restaurant "prego"? I thought it was a lamaze center.  I walked in demanding a lamaze session but was refused.  Who turns away a woman who is 7 months pregnant?  They need to really consider changing their name and not naming a place to eat after a term to describe pregnant women. I'm surprised more people haven't made this mistake.
