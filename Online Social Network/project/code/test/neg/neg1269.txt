Again, Brewco proves to be one of the worst bars I've ever been to.  On days that I don't feel like driving to a bar I'm left with either Maloney's (O'Hara's) or Brewco.  For some reason my roommate didn't have his current ID on him, but he did have his expired one.  Maloney's said they couldn't take it, then Brewco said the same.  We waited outside while our 2 friends went to use the restroom and my roommate and I were discussing why his ID wouldn't work.  I personally don't understand it because the ID was issues legally and the information is all the same and he could even verify with other forms of ID.  One of the bouncers heard this and jumped in on our conversation to tell us that we were wrong.  "It's no legal.  Why don't you learn something?"  This asshole kept going on and on and wouldn't let it go.  He even told the other bouncer "I love getting a rise out of people."  He told us to leave, even though we were on public property, and we told him we were waiting for our friends inside.  He responded with "I'll go in there and kick their fucking asses out too."  We even tried stepping further away from him, so he'd stop provoking us, but sure enough he just kept at it.  I and other friends have had too many incidences with bouncers at this place.  Some of the bartenders are no better.  Another yelper referred to these guys as sadistic and you can't help but see it in their eyes.  Even with great service this place is only worth about 2 stars.  No matter how badly I feel like staying in westwood to have a beer I will never spend a dime at this place again.
