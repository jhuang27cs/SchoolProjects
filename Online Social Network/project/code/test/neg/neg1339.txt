Since this place was close to the hospital after having orientation, I decided to eat here. I had their Pad Thai, and it was not what I expected and did not taste like Pad Thai. It was also expensive for the quality, but I guess it's normal for the surrounding area.

Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing...I'll give it another shot...maybe Pineapple Fried Rice? Any suggestions?
