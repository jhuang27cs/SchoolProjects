I don't know what's going on with all the good reviews. Maybe they had a change of ownership over the last year and now it's good, but let me tell you I've been going there (out of desperation) for a LONG time and I hate it every time. I saw a special on The Food Network on great places in Cambridge and they showed this place, I nearly crapped myself. I get sick 1/2 the time after I eat there. they say they are MSG free and I simply do not think they are telling the truth.
Everything is dripping in grease. I know it's Chinese, but it's the greasiest I have ever seen. EW!!!
My beloved Crab Rangoon is especially BAD.
all I can saw is ew ew ew ew ew!
