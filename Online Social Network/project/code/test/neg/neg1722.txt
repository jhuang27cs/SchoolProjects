Lord Oh No Thanks!

I went here with several work friends and I was not impressed.  My boyfriend was to be joining us later and I told him not to waste his time and that I would rather leave the establishment and go elsewhere with him.  They are way overpriced and their selection is really meh. 

Our waitress was ditzy and did not check on our table enough.  I ordered the veggie burger and it was not delicious.  It also came slobbered in hummus.  I like hummus.  I do not like ten pounds of hummus.  I also felt that I could have easily created a better tasting burger at home and I do not cook. 

The music selection was trying far too hard to be hip and the locks on the bathroom stalls were overly difficult????

The biggest turn off?  THE PRICE!
