I absolutely hate any expression that has the saying "small world" in it. I think it is insulting and ignorant, and therefore Small World Coffee had a large hill to climb.

It's a cute place though, it has a charm that is undeniable. It's bright, cheery colors and feeling are agreeable and inviting, but unfortunately grow old and somewhat distracting for a coffee shop once you sit down with your coffee and try to have a talk. The place is loud and crowded, and definitely not for studying or reading. The crowd is very diverse, with teenagers next to grandparents... it has the look of the go-to standard of town.

The coffee is basic, no-frills, but enjoyable and not weak. A small cup of joe sets you back only $1.75, and it is nice to be served in a real glass instead of paper or styrofoam.

I can deal with the noise, but my biggest complaint with Small World might just be that it tries too hard to be "worldly" instead of just letting it happen. It is not overly condescending, but I cannot help feel the burn of that just a little. It is not, actually, a small world that we live in, and realizing this would be a good first step!
