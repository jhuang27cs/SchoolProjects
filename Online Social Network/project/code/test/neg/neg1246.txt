I'm always trying to find reasonably priced spa treatments and at this location facials are at a decent price. HOWEVER, it's painful! Granted the esthetician let me know she does more aggressive extracting, but GEEZ! In the end my face felt clean but it was RED! So ok, I figured the redness would go away after a couple of hours and thank goodness I wasn't going anywhere after that. Unfortunately it didn't and the next day at work, my co worker asked me how it was and all I had to do was point out the scabs and red spots on my face where the extractions were done. It was like I went and did it myself! Yes the foot massage before the facial was great and the price was decent, but in the end just wasted money.
