It may not be the popular opinion but I'm really not a fan of Louis. I get the charm aspect fully and I've lived here my whole life and am well aware of this place's legacy with the Brown/RISD crowd. Honestly I've had some miserable experiences here though. 

One time in-particular, a friend and I ordered our food from the waitress who then preceded to punch out and go home without telling anyone. After half an hour waiting for eggs and toast we finally asked. They had no idea what we were talking about and were pretty rude and annoyed like WE had done something wrong. I don't care about the place's reputation for being a laid-back spot, It was really lame of them considering that we weren't even getting that upset about it.

The home fries are really undercooked which really breaks a breakfast place for me. I don't know, I go there only when my friends really want to and now I usually only get their watermelon, which is admittedly awesome and cheap.
