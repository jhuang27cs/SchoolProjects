I have to say, the steak sandwich wasn't awful, it was descent (Jims on South and Steve Prince of Steaks in the NE are better though). What wasn't so great was the 20 minute wait to get our sandwiches. That's a third of my lunch hour, spent sitting at a table by myself - in the Bellevue, tables get snatched up quickly, so you have to hold a table if you find one - while my fiance stood in line waiting. He said all the steaks were made as the orders were placed versus how Jim has a big honking pile of meat sitting on the grill ready to go. He also said he only saw two people working behind the counter. I had to inhale the steak and run back to work. It just wasn't an overall pleasant experience, so I won't be visiting them again.
