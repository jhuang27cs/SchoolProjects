Went for Lunch today, service was awful! The lady working there was scary and didnt even offer us drinks we had to flag down the guy and order.  We didnt really know what we wanted right away so she got the picture menu and stood there seemingly annoyed while we looked through it.  Food ended up being SUPER EXPENSIVE for very small portions (nothing like the pictures)!  After we got the check she gave us a small menu take out menu that had lunch prices that were way way less. Very annoying experience never going again.
