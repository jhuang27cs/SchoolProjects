Needs work!  The stylist who cut my hair today reeked of cigarette smoke.  Having my hair washed was very unpleasant while she stood over me.  I think she was new to cutting hair because she seemed unsure of herself.  The bush she used on me was full of other people's hair and looked like it had never been cleaned.  When she took off my cape, she lifted it up over me, instead of to the side, depositing all my hair right in my lap.  I'm satisfied with my haircut, but with a little training, my stylist could have given me a much nicer experience.  Lastly, I think it's very unprofessional that a lot of the stylists were wearing flip flops.  This is supposed to be a nice salon, not the beach.  I hope things will improve.
