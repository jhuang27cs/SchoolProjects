Ordered a slightly pricey small Iced Coffee here and and was shocked at how tiny it was!  The four ice cubes in the iced coffee were barely sufficient to stand up to the Austin heat blazing outside (the reason for my craving an iced coffee in the first place).  

Wowzers, I had to bring two of the milk /  half and half carafes to the cashier to ask for her to refill them before I could make my drink.  I was with a fairly large group so they all had to wait for the coffee house to get back up to operational speed.  It took them over 10 minutes to make my girlfriend from LA's  soy mocha frappuccino thing. I am certain it was not THAT complicated, the staff was just working in low gear on a Friday at 4 pm.  Advice, take an espresso shot and get back to high gear please! 

Our large group was forced to collect at the waiting area / front door of the store completely blocking people from coming in or getting out in the narrow store while our order was being completed.

 Coffee Bean's in general are a good chain store, and I look forward to going to them over Starbucks, this one was just a little underwhelming.
