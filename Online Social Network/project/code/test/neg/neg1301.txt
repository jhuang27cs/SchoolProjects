I came here to buy a pair of spinning shoes for Rev at my gym.
When I came in the store, a lady was at the casher and I asked her if they carry spinning shoes for women. 

She said "yes we do, but I cannot assist you right away, it will take time"

So, I said that is fine. I started checking shoes. After 10 min, I looked at her and she said it will be another 5-10 min. There was no customer and she was not really doing anything at the casher.

After 10min she came to me and said she does not carry any shoes in my size ( my size is 8) and I asked her to check again. Then she said she found only one. I tired them on and said I will buy these. 
At the time, there were 2 customer came into the store and she suddenly walked to them.  
I was standing there with a pair of shoes...

Since I already told her I will buy them, I assumed she will come back to me to get the shoes and bring them to the casher.

However, she started taking care of the 2 new customers until she put their stuff to the casher. So, I decided to line up behind them.

When she looked at me, she did not even apologized and just calculated the price.  I asked  her if I will have to put something on the back of the shose and she said I will have to buy one thing (I forgot the name).
When I looked at the thing, it was several screws and panel which I had no idea to put them under the shoes. 
I asked her if she could put them now and she said she cannot do that since she has so many things to do today.
She also told me it will be very simple and easy for  you.

I noticed there was a man fixing bikes at the corner of the store, so I asked her if he could help me.  She said no.

When I went to my gym, they put the screws for me and it took them 3 min. The woman at the store did not want to spend 3 min for me who spent $140.

I suggest you go different store where you will be treated like a human with respect.
