Lipstick on a pig!!!

Don't be fooled - this is billed as a bed and breakfast (both in marketing and in cost), but the truth is that it is an old motel with a paint job and some remodeling.  It is NOT the same as a converted house or a custom built B&B.  At its core, the Petit Soleil still has the same layout (a row of rooms with an outdoor walkway) and the same lack of sound insulation (you will not be able to sleep through the herd of elephants stomping around in the room above you).  Avoid the downstairs rooms at all costs.  Even worse, the rooms on the end, adjacent to Monterey Street have no sound insulation against the street noise.  I barely got any sleep at all, between the drunk college kids shouting, screaming, and running into the planter and the traffic noise, especially the 18 wheeler screechy brakes and super loud engines.  The hotel has no air conditioning, so the windows have to stay open for any air circulation at all, which of course just exacerbates the noise problem.  I've spent some time in France, and the Petit Soleil decor does not remind me of France in the least.  Rather, it smacks of kitsch.

Not a good experience at all, and I would definitely not stay here again, even at half the cost.
