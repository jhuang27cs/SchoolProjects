Awkward location- inside a shopping center, nestled between Ulta beauty store and AMC movie theatre.

Always walked by here when frequenting one of the above neighboring places and was curious if this place was good or your typical "mall food" sushi. A co-worker and I decided to stop here for lunch as we had some extra time. 

Service was decent Food was just okay. Not the worst quality sushi I have tasted yet nothing spectacular. I'd probably eat here again if craving sushi right before seeing seeing a movie. A step above Sushi Deli which does not say much at all...
