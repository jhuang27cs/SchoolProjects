I have to say I did like the Zen-like decor.  As for the food, you have got to be kidding..
I do not mind paying good prices for great food that fills me up, but it didn't even come close.  I think the chef is really trying too hard to be original.  The raviolis were pasty and tiny, more like a small dumpling.  For three that were stuck together, and what tasted like they were filled with grass, it was 15$.  The goat cheese/ beet salad also pricey, and small and didn't even have arugula.  It was just weird, and no need for cold mushrooms and a cold potatoe in there.  They only had one beet too.
The froie gras was the best of the three, but could have been cooked better.  
I would say go for the lounge, and the drinks were good, but don't bother to waste your time upstairs with a table for dining.  The service was also just ok.  
Good for drinks only
