I came here last Friday to get a mani/pedi. The entire time while the lady was cutting my cuticles she was digging so deep that I was bleeding every other nail. I kept jerking away from her but, she kept saying my cuticles are deep. Not true. I've had several mani's in the past never has this type of problem. I recommend not coming here ever! My cuticles are still hurting even after a week. I have puss coming out from two of my nail cuticles (or rather the skin) I should say. This has been one painful experience ever. I will NEVER return. But, I guess you get what you pay for. Not to mention I did not see a sterile station in their shop. They may not even have one. This should have been my first thought not to come here. 
Think twice or rather go somewhere else before coming to this place.
