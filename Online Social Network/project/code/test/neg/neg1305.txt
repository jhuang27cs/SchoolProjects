I'm convinced people only go here because of the space...it's open. Very different than other harlem spots. I've been for dinner and it sucked. I went back for brunch, it was a little better...but the wait for the food was out of order! How dare you have hungry people waiting to eat after sitting in church for 2.5- 3 hrs??? If you're going to have such a HUGE restaurant...you've should've alotted space for a HUGE kitchen, with lots of cooks to fill it. I don't want to hear "I'm sorry, the food is taking longer than expected...it's just that the kitchen is swamped". WTH? My stomach is NOT trying to hear that right about now...you're gonna have to come with something better than that...like a buscuit, a muffin...something. I can't nibble on excuses.
