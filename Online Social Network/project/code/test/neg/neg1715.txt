This is a place that is fun to go to if you just left the bars and have the munchies.  The food is okay.. oily.. not that great tasting either.  The employees seem a little disgruntled.

I have seen people bring work here and eat.  I don't actually understand why.  It needs to be a lot brighter for me to come here.
