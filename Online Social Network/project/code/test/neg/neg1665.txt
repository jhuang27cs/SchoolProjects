I came here with a bunch of friends during homecoming weekend. It was around 1 am. The bouncer saw a large group and requested a $5 cover.

$5 cover in Troy, NY? lol we're not in NYC.

Luckily one of my friends knew the bouncer and was able to talk the bouncer out of charging us.

Don't get the pineapple margarita, listed on their menu. It's awful. Too tart.

Live band and very spacious.
