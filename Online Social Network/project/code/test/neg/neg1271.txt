If you are looking for corned beef, don't go there. Ordered a "coach's reuben" today and was completely disappointed. The corned beef was average to low grade deli meat piled on bread in between sauerkraut and swiss. The corned beef  was ice cold. I can make a better reuben at home with Boar's Head meats. Zingerman's has the real deal deli corned beef, assuming you are willing to pay for an overpriced sandwich. But, overall I have yet to find good delis outside of Detroit area with good hot corned beef, pastrami, etc. and certainly nothing better than NYC. Anyone who gives this deli a good rating should drive 45 minutes to Detroit (Star Deli, Onion Roll Deli. Bread Basket, Steve's Deli, etc.) and check out what good corned beef and pastrami is all about. I only gave this place one star because the pickle was good.
