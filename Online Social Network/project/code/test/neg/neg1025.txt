I went to Firestone expecting to have my favorite Tri Tip Salad.  Apparently it has been a while since I have eaten here; they have done a nice remodel.  I ordered a salad to share with my sister, and like one of the other comments on this salad it seemed like they chopped up bits of Tri Tip, it lacked tomatoes, and red bell peppers like I remember it used to have.  It also had way more meat, bacon, and blue cheese going on than lettuce.  Just didn't seem very balanced.  It was ok, and the fries were a little over seasoned.  My main comment is when I asked the nice hostess for the owners business card, she sent me over to Hal who was behind the counter.  I asked if he/or a family member would be interested in opening another location down south.  He was very, very rude.  May still continue to eat here if they change the salad, and not go so crazy on seasoning the fries, and if the owner(Hal) would be a little more pleasurable.  I am in the business, and I have never treated people as he did!
