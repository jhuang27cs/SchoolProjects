When I walked in I thought this was going to be a good authentic Italian dinner I could carry out on a rainy day. The guy working the register looked like his name could be Sal, you could see the cooks back there Tony and Vinny making things happen. (Yeah I'm stereotyping, but in a good way) I just knew this was going to be a good home-style Italian meal. I can't even think of the fancy  name for the dish, but it was supposed to be chicken with hot Italian peppers in a white wine sauce over spaghetti.  The special for $12, I also ordered a side salad with Balsamic vinaigrette dressing and French bread. Sounds good right? 

First off, the noodles were DRRRYYY, there was no sauce visible, a chicken breast that was not even cut up, laid on top of a pile of pasta and sliced sausages. Both the chicken breast and the sausage had a good flavor, but where was the creamy white wine sauce? D*mn it! That ain't right! The salad had one cherry tomato and one black olive, the dressing was literally vinegar and oil, but not the good stuff you get at restaurants. The bread was buttered, but was hard and tough like a sponge that had dried in the sun after you've finished washing your car. It was BEYOND CHEWY; actually would've made a good garlic flavored toy for someones dog. 

I got GOT! Ya, hear G-O-T for $20. I'm fully convinced Mama Lucia was in the back with her feet up and fell asleep while Vinny and Tony put this makeshift meal together. It's done. It's over. The only Italian mom I trust is from my childhood, Mama Celeste.
