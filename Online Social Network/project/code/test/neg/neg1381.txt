Customer service at this place is the worst, ladies who work there are not friendly. I made an appointment to see Dr. Paul Cook. I waited for two hours and I was there 30 minutes before my appointment. When I was finally seen by Dr. Ziad  Melhem who made me feel like I had gone through a drive thru. He didn't spend time with me, he was at the door ready to leave never gave me a chance to ask him any questions.
