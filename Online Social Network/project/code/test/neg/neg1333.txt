I've only been here a couple of times and I was not impressed either time.  The decor is nice and you can have the option of sitting in the patio area, where you can people watch on Lake Avenue.  The food is really average at best and the service could probably be better.  I had the chicken stir fry on my most recent visit and it was just... eh.... I could make a better one at home.
