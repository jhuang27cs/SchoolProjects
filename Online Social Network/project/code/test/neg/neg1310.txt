Hate to be a hater, but I really didn't like the crepe here.  It was almost midnight and I'm starving looking for food.  I wanted something light and sweet.  I got the chocolate, nutella, strawberry crepe.  Few bites into it I realized it was just too damn sweet for me.  I don't know...just did not like the taste at all.  Normally, when I'm starving anything tastes good.  But the crepes here have failed me.
