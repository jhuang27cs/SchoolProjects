Very disappointing. Carmelina's has been one of our favorites when we are in the Hadley area but I'm not sure we will be back. Whatever you do, don't get a $35 filet there -- we ordered it medium and it came out raw. We asked them to cook it a bit more and it came out like a blackened piece of leather. There was no apology, and no concern for whether they had addressed the problem. When I said we were disappointed in the steak, there was no reaction. The Crazy Alfredo, also one of their "specialties", was also disappointing. Lastly, their so-called 20 oz margaritas -- which they advertise as a cut above, can't be more than 12 ounces.  All in all, overpriced, poor service and disappointing...
