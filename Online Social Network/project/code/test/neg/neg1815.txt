I brought my teenage daughter in the store today because she wanted to buy a very specific item.  We brought it to the register and the saleswoman immediately tried to sell us something else, then tried to sell us several more items...then tried to sell us a loyalty card. THEN..asked us to sign a petition that they had going in the store.  Ugh!  She wouldn't take "no" for an answer and it really made me angry.  She actually said to us "What, you don't know anyone with a birthday in August that you could get that for?"  Run away!
