We normally go to Chutney's; in fact they were my first experience with Indian food and I was hooked. Well, maybe I started a bit too high b/c Garam Masala is definitely no Chutney's. We met friends there the 1st time and they'd lost their liquor license or something so we could only order soda (not sure what the deal was or whether they're serving alcohol now). And let me tell ya- I needed more than Pepsi to wash down that mush. Generally my favorite dish is Lamb Tikka Masala. (I accidentally ordered it twice for delivery before I made the connection that this was the same bad restaurant I'd met my friends at). Both times I ordered the lamb tikka masala it was a different color. I thought they'd delivered the wrong dish. Whatever it was it was bland and oily. I barely detected spices. It was like lightly salted gravy w/lamb. Plus, the bill w/delivery AND wine came out to about the same as a dinner at Chutney's would put you back.Shameful excuse for Indian food.
