I've been to The Friendly Toast for breakfast three times, but I still can't nudge it above 2 stars.

First: food.  The Drunkard's French Toast with Grand Marnier and respberry sauce is quite tasty, and the portions are huge.  I've had the eggs benedict twice, and, while the eggs were poached just right both times and the hollandaise was definitely homemade and good, the pairing of that cayenne-y sauce with the spicy/peppery home fries gave me no alternative to water for heat relief.  A few small garnishes of fruit would have made the meal so much more enjoyable.  There also were a lot of burned potatoes in my home fries.  They do serve a terrific chai, though.

Second: staff.  I don't recall a host or hostess from any of my visits, so I assume our greetings were perfunctory at best.  The silly little waiters do have delusions of cool.  They seem perturbed at having their duties take them away from more important things.  They'll grow up.

Third: decor.  Green is my favorite color, but here, especially in the main, windowless room, it's oppressive, and someone should tell the owners that green is the worst backdrop for food.  As far as the accents are concerned, some are rather cute, but others are downright creepy.
