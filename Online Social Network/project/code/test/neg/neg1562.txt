This place is total hit or miss. I had a great experience at the Menlo Park salon. Then I went to try out the Burlingame salon when it opened it was a miserable experience. In a nutshell, it took my stylist 2 hours to admit she didn't know what she was doing and needed help. I asked her a few times if it was going ok, if it would be much longer and she said yes. Finally, the manager noticed the frustrated look on my face and brought out a lead to take over. And, she basically had to start over so I asked her to stop and after more than two hours, I left with partially done hair. I have curly hair, so it was noticeable. Had to finish it up myself at home. But, I am willing to give Menlo Park another try. Never going back to Burlingame. Would be nice to have a mirror in front of you that way I could speak up much sooner, but now I know. (intentionally design, no mirrors directly in-front of customer)
