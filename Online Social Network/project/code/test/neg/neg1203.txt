So, I bought some expensive boots which almost immediately fell apart. I desperately wanted to wear them on NYE, however, so I took them down to this place, which was conveniently close to my apartment. 

I should have seen this coming the moment I walked in the door, rather five minutes later. The man behind the counter was fixing a shelf, and though he clearly saw me, did not return my greeting and I sat there waiting for five minutes before I got a brusk hello. I had to beg for him to repair the boots in less than a week, and he finally agreed to have them ready on NYE (three days later) at 3pm, for a price that was more expensive than my original budget for fixing these shoes. I figured my last shoe repair guy spoiled me.

Fast forward to NYE, at 3:00: I walked in, and he was working on my boots. Not even halfway done. I again had to beg for them to repaired TODAY, and he told me to come back in an hour or two-though they closed two hours later. So I came back an hour and a half later, and they still weren't done. I waited 20 more minutes, and voilia. Fixed boots. The work *looks* solid, if not pretty. Crossing my fingers that they hold up...

Bottom line: I'm not coming back, especially if I have a deadline.
