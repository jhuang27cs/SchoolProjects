Admittedly, I don't really like Korean food, but I still feel like I have a right to review this place because 1) I've actually eaten here, and 2) I ate here with a group of Koreans. The decor was nice enough and I kind of liked the minimalist menu especially as someone who doesn't eat Korean food too often. Give me too many choices and I'll just be standing there confused for a while. 

We arrived a little before 12 to try to beat the lunch crowd and even then, our food took 15-20 mins to arrive. Fast, it was not. The portions were pretty good sized, but what really got me were the banchan. For some reason, all three I tried were super salty. My friends decided that the restaurant must be catering to the white american crowd which makes sense for their location, but does not make so much sense to my palate. I probably won't come back here again but wouldn't dissuade anyone from trying it once.
