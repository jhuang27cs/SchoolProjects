I can definitely see the appeal here.  Who wouldn't enjoy a couple scoops of ice cream in between two cookies?  And for a mere $1.50?  Be that as it may, in my opinion the cookies and ice cream just weren't very special.  I think if the cookies were warmer as opposed to room temperature it would make the ice cream sandwiches a tad better although it would obviously cause the ice cream to melt much faster.  I also ordered a brownie which should definitely be skipped as brownies made from Betty Crocker boxed powder mixes are much more chocolatey, rich and satisfying.  Glad I got to try this institution knowing how popular it is, but I'll probably only be returning with a friend at their insistence.
