This clinic could be wonderful but it is SOOOOOOOOOO UNORGANIZED! :-(

In a nutshell, if my insurance had better coverage at other dental clinics, I would not hesitate to seek them out...I did not feel that the services and staff were very on top of their game and it seemed really difficult to get an appointment (whether for an annual cleaning or a cavity/other more in depth procedure). Additionally, the day of my appointment (scheduled for 4pm) they called me at 10am to request I reschedule it for 2pm...and when I got there they seemed to be confused why I was there so early, um, there needs to be much better communication between the front desk/scheduling staff. 

I agree with Jen K. though, I LOVED my dental hygienist, she was friendly and thorough and I look forward to my next cleaning.

Notes: Make sure to advocate for yourself (if you need paperwork, check & double check on appointments, etc.).  IF getting a teeth cleaning, I highly recommend ANGIE!
