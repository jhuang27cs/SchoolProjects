I am an event coordinator and I also run a 2,100+ member Social group in Atlanta. I recently called to make reservations and they told me that I would have to just try my luck getting tables for my group since they didn't want to reserve their tables with a group of 15. They did tell me I could reserve their Events Facility for $150. Since we just wanted to do dessert and coffee after having a wonderful meal at Ecco in Midtown I decided to not rent their event facility, call ahead and see if they were busy. When I called I was told that they had tables open. We went over there we waited about 10 minutes and there were enough tables open for us all to sit down. All 15 of us ordered coffee and dessert, all the coffee and dessert came out about 15 minutes after we placed out order. After we got our dessert we were finishing up our dessert and coffee and sitting for about 15 minutes after it came out before the manager came over and told us we needed to consolidate our tables as we were taking up to much room. 11 of us got up and left as we were getting ready to leave anyway. The other 4 were told they were turning away business because of us... which the actual time we were sitting in their tables was about 30 minutes 15 waiting for coffee and desserts and 15 drinking it before we were told we needed to leave. In this time I did not see one person turned away and I was facing the doors. One of our members said to the manager it was too bad they were treating us in this fashion as we have 2,100 members in our group and we would have recommended them as well as leave a nice tip. We were then told by the waitress and manager that they did not need our business anyway. The dessert was good, a bit expensive but not too unreasonable. The service was AWFUL! We will not return and we will be posting on our members site as well as anywhere else how we were treated. Also I will not be recommending this facility to any of my clients.
