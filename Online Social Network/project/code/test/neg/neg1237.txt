The pizza's GOOD? What was I thinking. Maybe their so-called "gourmet" pies, but god no certainly not their plain. I went and ordered a small plain here one night and it was so thick, cheesy, the sauce downright awful, that I just threw it out after one slice.

And after I threw it out I cried because it was pretty expensive.
