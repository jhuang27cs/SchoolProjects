Bottom Line: Anthony Bourdain would eat here but by "eat," I mean just barely.

I used to live on a submarine and the kitchen reminded me of the galley. Stainless steel, ravaged by years of use. A kettle or pot rattling on the stove. Old pictures of glory days past. And a nice lady (whaa?) ready to dish you up a simple, straightforward, and extremely cost effective meal. Ok, so maybe there wasn't a nice old lady on the submarine but the mental imagery is the same. Bourdain, as a gonzo fringe enthusiast, would seek out this relic of the past. He'd sit down - make pleasant conversation - sip the straightforward coffee. And when presented, chow down on the nicely cooked sunny side up eggs and buttery, buttery toast.

And then he'd say, "mhmm, good." 

And it is. But it's not amazing, it's not skilled, and it isn't consistent. An old school diner not in a diner car is pretty hard to run solo and it shows. The restroom isn't pleasant, dish ware and surfaces aren't pristine, and sometimes... it takes four trips to the stove to melt the cheese in a grilled cheese sandwich. However, my two other friends and I settled up the bill with less than $10 and post hangover, it hit the spot momentarily. 

For most people, it will be a unique experience but not a great meal. Go there for the introspection and a quick way to break your late morning, alcohol induced fast. Then move on to better food elsewhere.
