This place has really gone downhill.  The service is horrible, the food is mediocre at best, the portions are very small for the prices.  

My family and I ate here last night spontaneously, we were in the area.  We came in with a toddler, it took 3 requests to get a high chair.  They never offered a child's menu, and we were struggling to find something on the regular menu for her to eat.  When she came to take our app./drink order, we asked if there was a kids menu.  She said.. 'Yes, do you want one?'  Duh.  We have a kid.  This should be a given when you walk through the door with a child, no? 

The waitress took our food order, passed over my Mom who was still considering options, took the rest of our orders, then left without coming back to my Mom to see what she wanted to order.  I had to flag her down to complete our order.

The food was underwhelming - calamari app too oily, the Ahi was more than seared, cooked almost all the way through, the salmon/spinach salad was so drenched in dressing, the spinach was completely wilted, fish & chips came out less than warm.

Spend your money on a quality seafood dinner somewhere else.  Scott's is not worth it.
