If you're sitting outside(where most of their seating is), they prefer you wait for someone to come around and take your order instead of you just walking up to the counter and ordering. The problem is then getting service. I have been multiple times where I've sat for 30 minutes or more, trying to get a waiter and being told "I'll be back in just a sec, hon," and then waiting another 10 minutes before finally giving up and leaving.
