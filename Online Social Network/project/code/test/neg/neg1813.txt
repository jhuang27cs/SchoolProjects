My husband and I came here to check it out after reading the reviews on Yelp~ The pictures looked amazing and when you get there it looks just as amazing in person... 

I got the bacaro burger... and it looked so good when it came out.. I asked for it to be cooked medium... when it came out it was RARE as can be and it in my opinion was disgusting... it actually made me LITERALLY SICK like no joke.... 

The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because my husband said his panini was okay and actually the White pizza was pretty freaking good... so maybe its a hit or miss... We might go back just to give it a whirl one more time... and maybe the review will change... but for now.. I have a bad taste in my mouth.... OH and the prices are pretty freaking good during happy hour... 5 dollars a plate.... but I ordered a coke... and it was 3 dollars... (no free refills) thats pretty much a rip off... but whatevers~~~ 

We'll see if it gets any better ... maybe we'll give it a try again.. Someday....
