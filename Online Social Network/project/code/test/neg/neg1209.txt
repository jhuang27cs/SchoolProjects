I went to Marathon with high hopes after hearing the hype and reading the very positive reviews about the Gyros.  An avowed "Gyro Snob", I was leery.  Would Marathon stand up to or surpass what I think is the Best Gyro in the world (Taverna the Greek Isles;  305 Pennsylvania Avenue, SE, Wash DC)?   My take 2 hours later:

(Spoiler Alert!  It did Not)

1) The ordering process was a nightmare.  People lined up in a hallway of an entrance; very crowded and loud.  The order is first given to a line person who then send to to the next (payment) person further down the line.  Lengthy wait for both.  

2) Once payment is made, the order is submitted.  Since the place was packed, I opted for take-out.  I will say that the wait, once I paid was brief.  

3) On my way out I stopped to peek inside a place two doors down from Marathon: The Pita Place, which advertises Gyros, Pizzas, etc.  Same stuff as Marathon.  Went inside. Very large and practically empty.

4) Got back to the office and opened my bag to find this Small, thghtly wrapped item.  My "Fabulous" Gyro.  Dry as dirt.  Way too little sauce.  The meat?  Tasted eXactly like any other Gyro meat at any other Gyro joint.  

Disappointed?  Big time.
