YUCK..! 

First let me say that I'm not picky about food -- especially fast food.

I had never had TC until my friend asked if I wanted to go with her. We ate inside and the food was mediocre but cheap; the service was rather crappy.

So, a few nights later I was starving at 2 am and decided to go to the TC drive-through and get a burrito. First, what I could see in the kitchen as I picked up my food was a bit scary -- the place looked disgusting, and there was some sort of tub of brown watery stuff with chunks floating in it (I seriously hope that's not what they feed us). I got back to my apartment, took a few bites and nearly vomited. Words cannot describe how disgusting this burrito was. It smelled like a sewer -- there was strange blackish brown mush in it that I could not identify. It looked like someone had taken some moldy, partially burnt meat and ground it in a blender, crapped in it then stuffed it in a tortilla. Not did it smell like rancid dog poop, it tasted like it too. I really wanted to purge after eating those few bites. I was very happy to get it out of my system the next day. 

I will never eat here again, this was the 2nd grossest food experience of my life -- the first was a live roach in my noodles at a Chinese food place. Even if this was just a fluke, it was too nasty. The horror of that burrito will forever haunt me in my nightmares.
