I just started coming to this location as we just moved to the area and I have to say I am slighly disappointed in this one. My husband and I went for our Taco Tuesday and guess what? the fish here was the worst I have even eaten at a Rubio's. The fish had hard little pieces I had to spit out. Bones? no, gross over cooked pieces. It seemed like they just kept re-dipping it into the oil to keep it hot. Big FAIL! I will try this location again and hopefully all the tacos we had are much better next time.
