Yelp totally captured my sentiments on this with, "meh."  

I've been twice, and each time I've left wishing I'd gone somewhere else. In the restaurant's defense, my friends seem to love it, but I'm just not feeling it. There's a freshness that draws me to Greek food that's lacking here, in the mousaka in particular, which was just kind of mushy and bland.  Very monochrome. Although, from reading other reviews, it seems like the salads are the way to go, and I still want to see this garden.  Maybe next time.
