The desserts here are visually pleasing and that's about all there is to this place.  The three times that I have been here, the taste of the desserts never was satisfying. The last time I was there I had the Boston cream pie accompanied with a little ice cream sandwich and Whoopie pie.  What is with that chewy wrap around the cake?? It definitely has a texture problem that gets in the way of the cake-eating experience.  I know many of their cakes have that.  The sweetness in the cake is very one-dimensional. The Whoopie pie is supposed to be the "Voted No. 1" Whoopie pie which makes me think that the "voters" had very low standard for the Whoopie pie.  The chocolate cakes of the pie are so√• hard and dry their texture resembles stale rice cakes.  The filling just tasted like thinned-out icing I can buy at a supermarket.

I honestly think that people who frequent and giggle over eating the desserts here are just on a high from seeing the dessert images. It can be an experience at Finale but good taste is definitely not part of it.
