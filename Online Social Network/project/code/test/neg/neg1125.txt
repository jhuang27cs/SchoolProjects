Cornerstone is hit or miss. If you just want to play pool at a bar close to campus, or come with a group of friends to watch a game on a flat screen this is a good place.

If you're looking to dance, hook up or generally be in a social environment, Cornerstone will deliver maybe 20% of the time. Even on nights that claim to be "busy" ones, the place can be absolutely dead or conversely jumpin'.

Yeah there are some cute girls here, but they are either with their boyfriend or their trusty fat friends to ensure they go home with no one but their chaperones.

Why do I give this two stars rather than one? Because I get in fights 75% of the time I come here. The fights are more entertaining than anything, because it's always some drunk frat boy(s) trying to look cool. It's usually all talk and no action, but from time to time we do throw down some fisticuffs. 

The chance of getting into a fight is really what brings me back here. Oh, and the artichoke spinach dip with nachos. That is pretty delicious.
