I don't remember ordering a side of bitter taste. YUCK! Perhaps I'm just a bad sandwich concocter, or maybe this place just did something to my sandwich that just did NOT taste good AT ALL. 

I ordered the Big Wreck. Sadly, its name is what I thought it to be. It tasted super bitter, and it made me think something was past its due date or else the combinations of everything in the sandwich just didn't compliment each other. 

Either way, I think I'll just stick with my Thunderclouds.

On a side note, love the look and feel of the place. I believe it can be summed up into one word, which immediately hit me when I found the perfect place to sit and eat. 

Quaint.
