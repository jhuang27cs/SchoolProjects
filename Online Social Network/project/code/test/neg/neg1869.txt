I would love to review this place for their food....but I can't.

Firebrand Saints called us an hour before our reservation and said they had no FOOD. I get that you're new and you have kinks to work out but what kind of restaurant doesn't have food to serve? The last time i checked that's sort of the definition of "restaurant."  They said it was b/c they had given it all away for free. Now, if you know you have reservations to honor, why would you give all that food away? And if you know you have no food, why would you only give us an hour's notice? And this isn't my business, but how does that make sense in running a business (give all your food away and turn away paying customers?) So we had to make last-minute reservations elsewhere.
