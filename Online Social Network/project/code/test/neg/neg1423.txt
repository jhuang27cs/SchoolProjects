Monday lunch review, ordered a fajitas burrito from the lunch special menu ($7.95). 
Good chips and watery salsa served upon being seated.  I have eaten at the various incarnations of El Toro for ten years, some pretty good, some not so much, but this was my first visit to the new Neil St. store, and it is really very nice.
Service started fine, party of one, not busy, several Hispanic male servers on the floor, but I got the girl.  Burrito arrived promptly, but the beans and sour cream in the menu description were missing.  The girl thought the beans might be in the burrito, and brought SC immediately.  If beans were in burrito, they were well hidden.  Conference between girl and waiter yielded a "side" of refritos on a 12 inch oval platter, easily a serving for four.  Spent rest of lunch wondering how much I would be charged for beans that were supposed to come with meal.  It was only $1.75, so no drama.  Original girl had gone missing, so not sure who I would have complained to in any event.  Ten minutes is a long time with dirty dishes and a credit card on the table to get permission to leave.    
Incidentally, the meat in the burrito was round steak, lean, tough, dry, tasteless.  I often buy skirt steak at the Mexican grocery, and make my own carne asada.  This was beef and peppers, in a tortilla.  Not terrible, but not great either.  Back to Taco Loco for my burritos from now on.
