Came in here looking for some creative inspiration to browse and to buy... design magazines and design books ... BUT... they hardly had anything. They didn't even have the normal "Print" "How" and "Communication Arts" on their magazine racks. Their design book selection were non-existent. 

Probably the least helpful "Books" location I've been to...
