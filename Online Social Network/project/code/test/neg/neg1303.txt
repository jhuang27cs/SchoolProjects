I recently had the misfortune of using the cleaners and alterations at this location. It was AWFUL. 

They overcharged me by a good $100 at least (compared to many more reputable cleaners further up the street or even a few blocks over.) 

They spilled DYE on my white dress and tried to convince me that I'd done it and then couldn't clean it properly. 

The seamstress (whose claim to fame is that she has a certificate from a junior college in alterations) did an AWFUL job and messed up the lines on my dresses and skirts, making it appear lumpy. It certainly didn't hang straight and she blamed it on my body.  I am a size 2!  In no way do my legs make divets along the zipper line. 

Upon calling this to their attention, the rather surly seamstress and cashier attempted to browbeat me into recognizing their clearly superior service over the Asian businesses they looked down upon in the area or more reputable shops all across the neighborhood and ended up yelling at me that I just was stupid. 

I will NEVER return to this establishment. I could've dragged out grandma's sewing machine or washed my clothes in Woolite and done MUCH better. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. 

You've been warned.
