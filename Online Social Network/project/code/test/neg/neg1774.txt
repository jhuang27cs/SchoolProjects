Dear Grace,

I really wanted to like you.  I gave you a chance even after reading poor reviews.  I had hope, but unfortunately, you didn't deliver.

You enticed me with your nice decor, but the appeal stopped there.

I had your warm frisee salad with poached eggs.  I was looking forward to breaking the poached eggs with my fork and have warm egg yolks run into my salad.  But what I ended up was two hard boiled eggs placed on top of my salad.  

My husband had your burger with frites.  There wasn't anything special about the burger.  Plus, $11 for a burger the size of a slider?  (jaw drops). 

We also ordered your miso glazed salmon with quinoa cakes and pickled red onion cucumber salad.  Did you really glaze the salmon with miso because I sure didn't taste it.  And the quinoa cakes wasn't anything to rave about.

I'll cut to the chase.  You provide slow service with ho-hum fare.  I gave you a chance and won't be back.

Sincerely,
me
