took a group here for fathers day, the buffet food was good, not great. the service( essentially taking drink orders and clearing plates) was fine.  The setting and value were less than desired. They stuffed so many people in that it was hard to move around, especially with children. it was so uncomfortable that we found ourselves standing to eat. I was also surprised at the deferred maintenance, between the carpet that we stuck to and the filthy restrooms, it almost felt like you were back in college.  we also noticed that the serving utensils were rarely changed. this place needs an over-haul.
