I hate myself for forgetting how bad this place actually is.  I have been here 3x times since it opened.  WHY?   The first time was horrible, swore not to go back, but I went back anyway.  Perhaps because it was late at night and they were the only ones open?  I don't know. 

This is BBQ chicken, however they also serve Korean dishes and soju. Their chicken is okay-good however their Korean food is another story.  It's rather horrible.  Very bland, half-ass food.  It comes with no side dishes, and the soup realllllly lacks favor.   Their chicken is good however it's very expensive for fried chicken and I don't think it's very "special".  I have tried their Olive Chicken, good and crispy but it came an hour after I was done eating our first entry.  Not worth the wait and 10 bucks! 

I had some chicken wing yesterday - don't hate it but don't love it.  It was dry and did not taste any better than the ones from Safeway. 

The atmosphere in this restaurant is confusing.  The lights are dimmed down, the music is loud and "hip" - very night club like.  We had Soju here once, and I have to say I am not comfortable with looking at pictures of little kids and family while I am drinking with "low, low, low" in the background.
