I've tried the pizza and the calzones. The pizza is weird, and incredibly greasy. The tomato sauce is too sweet. The cheese is seperated from the sauce and greasy.

The calzones are ok, it's mostly the same ingredients, but the dough was a little bit better and the grease didn't seem to explode out of the thing as much.
