Very unfriendly service. The girl at the counter did not even try to be nice. So obviously did not want to be at work, and hated taking my order. 

I sat down and waited. 

There were about 4 employees behind the counter, but it seemed like none of them were cooking. They were just bickering and being hostile to each other about something related to the stove or the fume hood. It took over 15 minutes to get my to-go falafel. 

The guy who brought it over was the only friendly employee in the restaurant. I took it and ran, never to return. 

The falafel was decent, but not worth the trouble of an unfriendly restaurant.
