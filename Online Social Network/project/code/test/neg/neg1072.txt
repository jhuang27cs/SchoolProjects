The service was okay, but not extraordinary.

The food is large portion and heavy in cream. In the "Wild about Seafood", a lobster and scallop alfredo, the scallops weren't cooked! It was too rich and thick with cook. I think its easy to eat your daily calories after a few spoonfuls of this dish. 

The Stuffed Pork Chop dinner was slightly undercooked as well. The portion was also huge, and the peas were old and starchy - like they had been sitting out and dried out. The pearl onions were flavorful, but the creamy mashed potatoes were way too heavy. The potatoes were just so gloopy and gluey.

Overall, its just average, I wouldn't go back. I'm not a health-freak and appreciate a good meal, regardless of the amount of fat or calories in it. But this food was disappointing.
