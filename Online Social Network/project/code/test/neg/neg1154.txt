I went here recently with some classmates for the first time and had an awful experience. We had a large group and ordered several deep dish pizzas.  The others came out as expected, but as their pizzas came to the table our waitress realized she had forgotten to put in the order for a deep dish pizza my friend and I were splitting.  This is a pretty big mistake to make considering it takes a good 45 minutes to an hour to make a deep dish.  What's worse is what happened after that. Instead of offering to bring us an appetizer on the house or something to hold us over (I was pretty starving at this point and we had already been there for an hour) she simply says "I would understand if you don't tip me, I'm sorry"  and offered to make us a thin crust instead. I don't care for thin crust pizza so I declined and said we would just wait.  About fifteen minutes later she comes by and offers some garlic bread so we accepted that. However, she waited so long to offer it that we got it just before our pizza came out and we no longer wanted it. Basically it was just a really frustrating experience and the waitress could have been more helpful considering it was her big mistake.  
I also didn't realize that it costs $4 for a Diet Coke. I mean, it's a large cup, but c'mon. That's pretty steep even with getting a refill. 
On top of that, when we got our pizza, I was not impressed. For the time I spent here, I could have just driven to Chicago and had a real deep dish pizza. It might be the best in Champaign, but I don't think it's worth waiting for.
