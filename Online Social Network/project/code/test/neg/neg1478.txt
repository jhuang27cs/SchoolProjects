I have had very mixed results from Pep Boys at Market St. I would actually say the mechanics are slightly better than the guys behind the auto parts desk - one of those guys is clearly racist as he will help black folks who clearly arrived at the desk later than me even though I LIVE RIGHT BEHIND THE PEP BOYS.

A big scam they ran on me is this buy 3 tires, get a fourth free. To qualify you need to purchase their alignment service which invariably involves them telling you need new tie rods, suspension, air freshener etc. Just expect to pay for 4 damn tires.

These days I take my car to Carlos' shop at 40th and Powelton and just go to Pep Boys for parts when I need to feel really white.
