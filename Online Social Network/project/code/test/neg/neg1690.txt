NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS JUST FOR LUNCH.

The Field might be a poppin' place at night, but today lunch was EMPTY. I had the clam chowder and some type of frankfurter plate.. Clam chowder wasn't too bad, but I was NOT A FAN of the frankfurter plate. Came on an oversized bun with thick cut fries and coleslaw. The frank was kinda cold in the middle, the fries weren't hot, and the bun was DRY. I ended up tossing most of it and going somewhere else to eat.

Maybe I just came on a bad day, but I don't think I'll be coming back.
