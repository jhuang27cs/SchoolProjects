Maybe one of the worst meals I've had in Pgh in 40 years. I got the grilled eggplant-tomato-mozzarella stack. The eggplant arrived more dried than grilled -- tough and tasteless. Wife ordered the spaghetti carbonara. Whereas genuine carbonara has bacon, egg and cheese, this arrived with no egg, no cheese, undercooked bacon, swimming in tasteless oil and covered in burned onions. Not caramelized, but actually burned black. We sent the eggplant back uneaten, explaining to the waiter what was wrong and asking for a dish of the carbonara without the burned onions. To my great surpise, that's what we got -- no burned onions, shaved cheese added this time, actually not awful but also not carbonara. Giving up, we tried the cannoli, which turned out to be rock-hard (not crisp) shells filled with grainy (not smooth) mascarpone mix.

In all a disaster. Avoid it.
