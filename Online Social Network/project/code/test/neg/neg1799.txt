This place is filthy.

I'm not a fan of any of these restaurants posting USC crap all over the place.

Do I hate USC? Hell No. I love the school. I just don't like feeling like the school is being force-fed into the surrounding community.

The food? Gross as all hell but good at the same time.

Fast food. I should just start drinking grease and snorting mayonnaise.
