I was craving some candy and decided to stop in.  I only wanted a small handful of Swedish fish--5 or so.  I bagged it and took it to the counter and placed the bag on the scale.

At that point, I was scolded by the woman behind the counter because I didn't buy enough.  Could I pay something?  No, just take it and leave.

Well, okay.

If you like obnoxious music and have the willpower to eat just a few pieces of stale candy from a large pouch, this place can be good (my husband bought me a small bag of mellocremes prior to Star Wars, which were hard).
