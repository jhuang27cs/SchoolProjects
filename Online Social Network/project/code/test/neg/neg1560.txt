The worse and I mean WORSE customer service ever!  We waited well over a half hour for our check.  And once the waiter gave us the check, he walked away and another 15 minutes later we were still waiting for him!  It looked as though he was coming our way, however just continued on and into the kitchen!  The food is okay, nothing memorable.  Stick to getting a growler of their beer (which was pretty good) and getting the hell out of there!
