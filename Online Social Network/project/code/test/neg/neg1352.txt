Eww, what a dirty restaurant. The place was not clean. It reeked. My group waited several minutes for the girl behind the counter to acknowledge us, despite the fact that she could see us standing there. She wasn't friendly at all, and repeatedly gave us 'what huh?' looks when we indicated what we wanted one our burritos. NO thanks. Normally, I love Qdoba but this location was awful.

The worst part would be the bathrooms. Do not go in there. Go somewhere else or you may be scarred for life.

So many better options around on Mass. Ave. that there should be no reason for anyone else to find themselves at this particular Qdoba.
