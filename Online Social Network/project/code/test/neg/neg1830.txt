We took our 1 year old son here for his first haircut and had an absolutely horrible experience.  The lady tending to him was so harsh with him that he started crying and then she got completely worked up that a baby was crying though his haircut and got sloppier with her work! Didnt expect this from a professional trained to work with babies!! Dont think I'll be taking my child back here again.

I went here based on the yelp reviews here but looks like this place has a mixed bag of hair stylists - so please pay attention to who you go with here!
