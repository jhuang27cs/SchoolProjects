I must've ordered the wrong thing because The reviews here don't reflect my experience. I stopped by around 4 pm and ordered a quesadilla and chicken burrito and an horchata to drink, the place was not busy at all and there were only 2 patrons besides me. The horchata was good but the meals were kinda greasy and fell apart way too easily. It took forever for the beans and rice to arrive. It tasted like all of the flavor just congealed into one another so it was hard to separate the ingredients and appreciate the flavor. But I have faith in my fellow yelpers and won't hesitate to give this place a try again.
