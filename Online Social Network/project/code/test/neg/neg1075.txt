The first time and last time I went to Heroes was when I was in high school. Great, you guys think. Some emo high schooler who went to a bar/restaurant is reviewing this restaurant. Mind you that was a little over six-seven years ago. All I can say was that though the peanut shells on the floor, like everyone is mentioning, is pretty awesome. But despite this kitschy atmosphere, there was still not excuse for the extremely poor service. 

I think I got there on an afternoon, not even a rush hour. It was 3PM, on a Tuesday. Really, no one was there, no one was waiting. Yet ironically I had to. I had to wait. 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge my existence. I thought this was odd. With an almost empty restaurant, you'd think service be quick. Strike one. 

Before I was seated, two couples were seated before me. Wait, what? Yeah, that's right, TWO COUPLES were SEATED BEFORE me. That was with the "Excuse me, miss? Um, I believe I was here first?" 

Strike two. 

When I finally got to my seat and ordered a particulary easy club sandwich, I had to wait another 30 minutes to get my food. Seriously? 30 minutes? With only three other tables? And for a club sandwich? And I'm not sure what people are talking about the huge portions, maybe because  I only ordered a sandwich, but it was just a regularly sized portion. 

Strike three. 

Maybe because I was young, or maybe because they just suck, that should really be no excuse to give such crappy service to anyone. And you think being a Claremont native would have been a plus. O well.
