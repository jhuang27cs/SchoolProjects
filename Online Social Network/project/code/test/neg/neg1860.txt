I really support the idea behind Planned Parenthood, but I also really hope the treatment I received here is the exception instead of the rule.

I came to Planned Parenthood with severe pain problems, hoping to get some answers if not direct treatment, but the staff treated me terribly every step of the way. After filling out the little questionnaire before my actual appointment, I could hear the doctor and one of the nurses openly making fun of my answers within earshot of the entire waiting room.

Once I got into the exam room, I was treated to an extensive and judgmental lecture about my current lack of birth control without any opportunity to explain the (personal, painful) reasons why I didn't need to use it at the time. During the exam, the nurse was completely unsympathetic, and told me my pain problems were all in my head, even though I had nearly blacked out on the exam table from the pain not five minutes earlier. She also told me I was sexually immature and would grow out of it eventually. I was given a referral to mental health services, despite telling them I was already in therapy, and sent on my way in a much sorrier state than when I had arrived.

The entire experience was painful and humiliating, the staff was callous and flat-out incompetent, and to top it off, I received a message from them a month later telling me that since I hadn't followed their referral for therapy, they reserved the right to deny me services in the future. Good riddance.
