Honestly, I was hoping my experience would have been better.  This is the kind of place that you wonder if the glasses of water they give you are safe to drink.

My friend and I both ordered the Soft Tofu soup which was way too salty to the point that it turned bitter on your tongue and your taste buds become temporarily paralyzed.

My other friend ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap.  The rice was mushy and my friend described her Bibimbap as "gooey".  Wet rice is a no-go.  Banchan was okay but not memorable.

Walls, chairs, and tables were sticky.  Beware if you are a germaphobe!

Even Mr. Handsome Waiter can not convince me to return.
