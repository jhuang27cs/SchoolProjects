UPDATE 8/31/07 - They're pretentious here.  I was asked to write a review about them for a website and they weren't very cooperative saying they weren't sure they were going to be shed in "the right light".  *rolls eyes*.  I shall not be going back.   Their pinneaple sake is good but their regular food (aside from their Valentine's Day prixe fixe menu that one time) is nothing to rave about.

All I have to say is...wherever there's pineapple sake...I AM THERE!!

Haven't tried to sushi but I did one of those prix fixe menus on a special occasion.  I kept my menu scroll from that night and here's what I had...

Tengu's signature house-infused chilled pinneaple sake
1st course -Chef's special salad:  Watercress and arugula sald with baby golden beets, chevre goat cheese, shaved carrot and miso dressing
2nd course - Chef's special appetizer: minuet of foie gras and asparagus, wrapped in filet mignon with sweet soy mirin glaze and white truffle oil
Intermezzo: duet of champagne and passion fruit sorbets, with fresh granadilla
3rd course - Chef's special entree: Pan roasted medallions of veal tenderloin over whipped kobacha squash, lemon wilted spinach, and shamiji mushroom pan sauce.
4th course - Chef's special temptations: Giant stem strawberries with amore white and dark chocolate drizzle, mascarpone cream and dark chocolate pirouette.

Everything was fantastic! Haven't tried the sushi but I'm sure it's good.  The ambience inside is reaally dark..asian inspired of course.  We sat on the patio that night so it was much quieter.  I definitely have to go back on another special occasion.
