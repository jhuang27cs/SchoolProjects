I'm only giving Spice two stars for ambiance alone.  I went for a birthday dinner with several friends and couldn't have been more disappointed.  :(  To me, Spice tried to be posh but didn't have the service to back it up...  It's an eye catching building right off of Juniper. Could possibly be a different  experience with a better server as ours couldn't have been less attentive (food was brought out cold, drinks consistently empty, on top of our servers' bad attitude and a big check at the end). I've only been once, but based on that time, I will not give it another try..
