When I heard a 'ramen' restaurant had opened in Champaign, I was excited because I thought there was a chance this might mean something vaguely approximating homemade/authentic ramen noodle soup.

Nope.

Doodles is basically just instant ramen noodles with a selection of ingredients that you can add in. Granted, some of the add-ins are tasty, but if I'm just putting them into instant ramen, who cares? I could do that at home for dirt cheap, and the comparative value the restaurant offers by providing the selection of add-ins at your disposal doesn't seem worth the markup to me. Either way, bleh noodles are bleh noodles.

The owner offered me free sushi because it was around closing, which was nice of him, but unfortunately the sushi was pretty bland and low-quality as well.
