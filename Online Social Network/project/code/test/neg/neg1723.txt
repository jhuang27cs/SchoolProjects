Nerds!

Seriously, though, nerds.  For a school full of people so springloaded to get in, you'd think there'd be a fun explosion once they do.  Not the case.

HOWEVER
The school itself is really great.  The main yahd is great looking during all seasons, there's a bunch of cool history, Harvard has all kinds of neat buildings and perks, and great fucking location to be living at.

N.B.  The statue of John Harvard (even though it's not actually him) has a very shiny shoe.  It is shiny because people think that it's good luck to rub the shoe, and will help them get in.  What they don't know is that students occasionally urinate on that very shoe at night.  Hilarious.

N.B.2  I didn't go to Harvard, nor have I wanted to.  It is what it is.
