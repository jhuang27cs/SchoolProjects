THX certified, but not that comfortable.  As an old theatre, I expected to walk in to a movie palace, instead they've rennovated all the character out of the place and made it pretty bland.  The theatre is long and narrow, so when you are seated towards the back it is not that much better than watching a movie on the big screen at home.
