This is the only place to shop for clothes/shoes around on Thayer. Let's not be hasty and take this the wrong way, which would be in a positive manner. There is just literally nowhere else, which is why I had desperately resort on buying an overpriced pair of flats for an event that same day. 
The service is questionable. In shops, typically the retail employees say something like "hi, how are you doing?" but the people who work here don't even acknowlege that you need help finding shoes. I always hear that there are sales here, but the ones i've seen aren't any real discount; they just put the prices back down to what they really should cost. The selection isn't even that great; there are some pairs of nicer shoes and some cheapy brands that look like they will fall apart after a week of use.
Berk's is a bit late in getting things that are featured "now" so i'd say it's better to just head down to Providence Place mall for better prices and selection.
