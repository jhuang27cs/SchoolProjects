New York Pizza?  Has anyone who makes the pizza in this place  (or owns the store) actually had NY Pizza?

I keep looking for good pizza in Houston and each time I'm disappointed.  This pizza has too much dough and too much cheese.  Maybe the taste works for other people, but it doesn't work for me, nor did it work for my dining companion.

Another complaint I have is that the website offers coupons that aren't valid for this location since they don't make a few of the pizza's that other places do.   I'm not sure why a chain wouldn't offer the same products at all locations. 

Needless to say, the pizza was ready when promised and the service was friendly.  You just need to decide whether you like this pizza. I don't, and will not be back.
