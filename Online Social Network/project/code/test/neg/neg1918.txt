I've been a magician for over 20 years and was excited to see a sign in the heart of Ann Arbor that said "Ann Arbor Magic Shop".  With Ann Arbor's vibrant and eclectic environment, I've always thought that a well run magic shop would do good business in the city.  Having been to some of the best stores in north america, I expected good things from this store but boy was I let down.  As you walk down the stairs (below Afternoon Delight), you will see the store on the left but it isn't clear until you realize that the magic store itself is mixed in with a sports memorabilia shop.  Having been open for 4 months (around August), the dual store was extremely disorganized with stuff EVERYWHERE.  The store owner, Kenny, was pleasant but is really just an amateur magician/memorabilia collector who is trying to find anybody who is foolish enough to pay top dollar to buy his used goods.  Even my friend, a non-magician, left saying, "It looks like they are just selling some really old stuff in there".  And boy was he correct.  Most of the items looked old and had already been opened almost as if they had been opened but never used much since the trick sucked or never fit into a show.  I walked in hoping to find a diamond in the rough but left feeling like it was a shame to brick and mortar magic shops across the world.  The problem is that the tricks were severely overpriced (compared to online vendors) and there wasn't anybody who was actively selling the goods.  Along with a disasterously messy shop, it summed up to a very unpleasant experience.

I am all for supporting the local business, especially the niche shops.  However, the Ann Arbor Magic Shop does not deserve my (nor your patronage) until it cleans up its act and it's store.  What should've been a wonderful and exciting experience (as magic should feel) left a sour taste in my mouth.

But don't let me convince you.  Go and judge for yourselves!  I'll be back in six months to see if they made any changes.
