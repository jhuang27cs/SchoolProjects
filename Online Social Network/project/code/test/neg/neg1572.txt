BOOO.

In our market economy, businesses stay ahead of their competitors through myriad techniques, combining marketing, superior service, deliverables, location, etc.

So when I broke my spoke the other day in Westwood, I thought "what a great opportunity to frequent Helen's Cycles in Westwood and see what they are all about."

Waste of time.  Bad service is what they are all about.  Getting your spoke fixed is a 25 minute job.  I wasn't demanding immediate attention.  However, I think that coming in at ten and asking that if sometime between a seven hour span your bike might get attention isn't too much to ask.

I guess it is.  In the short run, you could say they didn't lose much by turning me away.  However, in the long run when you consider I'll be biking in and around Helen's until the Fall of 2008 and I will no longer frequent said establishment nor encourage any one else to go there, their loss could be in the thousands.  All because they didn't want to squeeze me in.  Lame.

Instead, I biked on over to Veloworx on Lincoln (my favorite bike shop) and got my bike serviced as soon as I came in.

The only reason it isn't one star is because he did offer to sell me a spoke, just didn't have time to do it myself.
