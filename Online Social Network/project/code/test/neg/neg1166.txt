I ate here for the first time today. My impression was that the only reason to go here is that it's dirt-cheap. Other than that, it was completely unremarkable. The food was no better than a fast food chain, and the person at the register seemed very tired, apathetic, and unwelcoming. I don't plan to ever return. If I want a cheap lunch, I'll go to Kiva Han and get the Granola Works, because that at least tastes good and is healthy.
