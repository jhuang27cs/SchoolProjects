I was shocked at the condescending treatment that I received from the smarmy-looking Asian salesperson at the Shreve Palo Alto store.  Given that I received excellent service from the SF Shreve store when I purchased a watch from them in 2008, I assumed that I'd get the same level of service in the PA store.  Not only did I not get the same level of service at this store, I pretty much had my worst experience at a high-end store thanks to this salesperson.  Sorry Shreve PA, but you can't expect people to drop 20k at a store if your salespeople act as if you're not worthy of their time and insult you for asking basic questions about a watch that you're interested in purchasing.
