Crowded and relatively expensive, much like every other CPK on the west coast.  I guess the thai chicken pizza has lost its novelty after years of business.  Today, the food definitely tastes cheap.  

I don't know if this is regular policy, but if you want dinner bread these days, you have to ask.  And make sure you don't ask for the "dinner rolls"  they cost extra.
