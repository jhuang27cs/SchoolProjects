Unfortunately, I've been here several times. My daughter's friend loves this place. So, my daughter requested it for her birthday too.
The food is mostly boiled in broth. Meat Boiled in salty broth is NOT something that I seek out. In fact, I don't usually eat much when we go. I try the veges, but even those turn out too salty with that broth. 
The teens like the experience of dipping the foods.
they always seem to enjoy it. It is very expensive for what you get. I do not consider this good food or good value. The young servers always flirt with the kids, I think that this is one of the appealing qualities of this restaurant for the kids.
The food does not seem healthy, too much salt and you really don't know if that pork is cooked enough.
If you love good food and you are using your own money (the kids don't), then you will probably NOT like this restaurant.
I always try to avoid it.
