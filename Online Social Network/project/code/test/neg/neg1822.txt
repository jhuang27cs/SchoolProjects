This place is god-awful. I don't even have the time or energy to go through all the things that are wrong. I will just say that the service is the worst aspect of this place--and that's saying a lot, because I'm not sure there is anything redeemable whatsoever. 

They are liars and try to charge you for everything, even things you have already paid for. When you try to speak to management, they are even worse. Just save yourself the pain and anger and steer clear of this place.
