This was a horrible experience for me. After 2 years, I had had enough. Dr. Jean is condescending and rude, will not listen to your opinion as  another, loves to push medications and unnecessary vaccinations. She also loves to create ridiculous excuses for appointments (a 21-month checkup of a healthy child??) just to rack up bills. She is rude to her staff as I have seen many times. The worst part is when I asked to switch, she charged me $50 per child to transfer their charts. When I asked her why, she said it was to pay for the cost of copying the charts (last I heard, it does not cost more than 5 cents per page to copy). She is just out to make a buck from what I can see.
