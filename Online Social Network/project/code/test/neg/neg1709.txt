You saw that right:  a Zero.  This is a first in the history of Sean S reviews.  It took 182 reviews to find one, but here it is - a Zero.

Zero service.  I felt sick even tipping Raul $10 on my $113-half of the bill.

Let me start off with the good things:
The food is yum yum yum!  The building and decor is quaint and intricate.  The waitress (not responsible for the Zero) was super cute.  The lettuce is organic.

Now we'll get into what you're reading for:
I know the lettuce is organic because the produce sticker that we found in one of our salads said so.
I asked for a recommendation on an earthy, tannic wine.  It was tannic, but not at all earthy.
The wine was not at all chilled.  After thinking about it, i should have felt the bottle and told him to take it back.  In a truly nice resto (and not a faker like this), having to even consider that they would bring out a room temp wine would be silly.
That last pour or two:  He poured the sediment from the wine INTO our glasses!!
While my mother was STILL EATING (her Mother's Day dinner), they CLEARED all our other plates from the table.  Anyone who knows me or has read some of my other 1- and 2-star reviews knows that this makes me go silent with rage and flush in the face as murderous emotions boil to the surface of my otherwise calm countenance.

I was so furious that I couldn't bear to get dessert here, so we went down the street to Diddy Riese instead.

I am hereby officially petitioning Yelp for a Zero Star rating.  That is what Tanino deserves.
