So,
our friends came here to eat.
so we met up with them here later, 
we didnt realize they were closed even tho the main door was closed.
thats because we dont really know the area and the previous restaurant we went to had a side entrance.
so we went through the side entrance (door was closed shut but  it was open. we assumed thats how you get in)
also, there was a good number of people inside still eating.
when we met up with our friends, the lady was just plain rude to us.
she was snobby and also told us they were close. she pointed out that the entrances were closed, and said they had no room for us to sit and we could not order.
Luckily we had just met up with our friends there, and not to eat.
We were still kinda like what the because she had said we they had no room for us to sit.
which was not true, as there was room for us next to our friends.
Seriously.
And so we decided to go back to cocomero.
