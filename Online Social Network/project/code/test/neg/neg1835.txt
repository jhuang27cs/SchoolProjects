We have had TCF accounts for years and been satisfied until recently When one of our check/ATM cards had fraudulent charges, I called the customer service number and they told me they could not check the account  because of computer problems.  I went to the local branch on Stadium, they cancelled the card and told me they would request a new card.  After two weeks and no card, I called to check on the card.  Turns out, it had never been ordered.  They requested a new card.  It's now been over two weeks and the card has still not arrived.  When I went to the branch to inquire, they once again cancelled the card and reissued it but did not offer to expedite getting the card to me  because it would be a $25 fee.  It's now been over a month since the card was cancelled and now I have to wait another week to get the card!! 

TCF in generall seems to be having computer problems.  On Mother's Day all ATMs in Ann Arbor were not working.

I'm moving to another bank.
