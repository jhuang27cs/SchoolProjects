So, I'll be clear, this place is best experienced crunk.  That's right, crazy drunk.  It is super dirty and just generally pretty gross.  Avoid at all costs if the bathroom is broken or you will see a homeless mans wiener as he just stands at the bottom of the stairs and pees into the swelling pool of fetid urine and vomit.  Pittsburghers love this place because they give you a comically large amount of food, that you will ultimately regret eating when you actually start sweating french fries.  If you hate your body, or really like man vs. food but think he's just too elitist, then this could be your place.  It remains open because college kids are an equal mix of stupid and poor.
