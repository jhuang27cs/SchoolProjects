I attended this school and I have to say that all they did was give me a book with 100+ drinks and the instructor only taught me one drink off of each chapter then I was on my own.

I paid extra for my TIPS class and I NEVER RECEIVED MY TIPS CERTIFICATION. THEY NEVER MAILED IT.

The instructors here were either in the other room on the phone or on Facebook or Worldstar hip hop.

I learned everything I know now through live experience on the field and all those drinks were not even applied to the real world. Each place has their own menu of cocktails and maybe just maybe some well known drink will pop up like a Mai Tai or Rum Runner.

Please reconsider and choose another academy.
