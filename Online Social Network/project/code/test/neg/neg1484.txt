After reading the reviews and hearing from the front desk lady at the hotel, we went to this place for breakfast while on a visit to Brown University.

First of all, the place does not look clean.  The guy cooking the food, went from behind the kitchen to the cash register to take money for people paying and then not wasing his hands when he went back.

As for the food - what an unappetizing looking mess.  I ordered a 3,3,3 (3 each of pancakes, eggs, bacon).  The pancakes looked as if they had been dropped on the floor, all brittle and broken up and dry.  The bacon was thin enough to see through. And what they called "jelly" for the toast was a liquid in a squeeze ketchup type bottle.  My son ordered a breakfast sandwich that had so much melted cheese on it I expect he will be constipated for a few days.

As for the price - for these culinary disasters we were charged over $21.  I told the cook/cashier how disappointing the pancakes were, he said "take $1 off".  Big deal.

I saw on one of the newpaper clippings that Brown University was trying to acquire the land a few years ago to expand the campus.  They would be doing us a favor if they did.
