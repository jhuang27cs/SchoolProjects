I arrived on a Sunday around 12:30 PM with a party of four adults. The place wasn't packed.  

The food was tasty, the portions modest but still tasty.  the issue was the surliness of the wait staff.  No one asked  how the meal was, or offered refills on the water.  the thing that was extremely odd was how getting the condiments to go with our meal was like extracting teeth.  I had pancakes, I wanted butter I have to ask repeatedly as they got cold..ridiculous
