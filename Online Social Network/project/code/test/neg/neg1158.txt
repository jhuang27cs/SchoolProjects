The plain cheese pizza was actually really good, crispy and gooey.  But the service was a bit of a nightmare.  I went in with two friends one late night, and the place was packed with a large party at a sit down table and a bunch of summer camp kids at the counter waiting for a take out order.  Everyone working was so stressed out, and when the large party came up to the counter rudely saying that they were done and did not need the last pizza they ordered, it just sent a bad vibe through the restaurant.  The cashier was freaking out because he didn't have any ones, and although i triend to calm him down and reassure him that it was ok while he was ringing me up, he was still really stressed and freaking out.  
Artichoke Basil needs to step up to the plate to compete with the other popular pizza places on Franklin.  Although they offer a signature slice that you can't find anywhere else, their staff will contradict the food quality if they can't handle business.
