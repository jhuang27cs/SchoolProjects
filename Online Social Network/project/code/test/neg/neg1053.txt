Visited the Sony Style Store a few weeks ago to look at the new X-Series mp3 player before going into Sprinkles next door.  

When my friend and I walked in, the staff looked at us for a quick second, seemed to have sized us up as non-buyers, and left us alone the entire time.  

As I walked by a small huddle of employees, I looked over to offer a smile of knowing only to be glanced at, then quickly be ignored.  

While I wasn't there to buy nor ask questions, that level of customer service was... lacking.  At that point, even if I was ready to buy, I probably wouldn't have wanted to spend my money there just from that interaction alone.

On a positive note, the store was well-kept: clean floors, organized shelves / stock, and functional product.
