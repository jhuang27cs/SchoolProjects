Really 2.5 stars. We had an impromptu lunch when we were walking home and there wasn't a line (for once). I don't mind cramped seating, cash only, no bathroom, etc. The ingredients were fresh and the bun was sublimely toasted, but there is no excuse for waiting 30 minutes for food when the restaurant isn't even full or for the terribly cooked burger. I ordered medium well, got a burger that was charcoal on the outside and unevenly cooked inside - big bloody areas and dry, overcooked areas.  The burnt taste overpowered both the bacon and bleu cheese and blood dripping from my supposed to be medium well food set off gag reflexes for me. It was obvious the cook was using too high heat and pressing the very thick patty against the grill with quite a bit of force.

Service was also terrible. They seem to always be hiring new waitstaff, and it's never a good sign when there is a handwritten sign in plain sight of customers admonishing employees to wait on customers and not let customers wait on you. We definitely waited on them.

I'm glad we visited once just to say we've been, but I don't think I'll be back. There's no reason to fight with all of the tourists for a bloody charcoal burger.
