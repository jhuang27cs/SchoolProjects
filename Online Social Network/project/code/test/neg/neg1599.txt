Well, their sign says it all, "No 1 wok"; as in, No, don't bother trying it.

I ordered a combination plate and asked for fried rice, but got white, the egg role was terribly overdone, and the sweet and sour chicken was just ok.

For the price, I would go to a few other places in Champaign-Urbana and get much better quality.
