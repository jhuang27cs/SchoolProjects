My expectations of this place were pretty normal - I just wanted my computer repaired in the time frame they quoted for the price they quoted and to be informed when the computer was ready. Instead, my computer took 12 days to be repaired (9 business days, I was quoted 5 to 7 business days), no one called me to say it would take longer than expected, and no one called me when the computer was completed. In return for this lack of service, I requested a discount and received a half an hour off the cost of the labor. But I would have gladly paid full price to get my computer (you know, the most essential object in my life) back on time. Otherwise, I could have taken it somewhere else and gotten a more timely repair. It was a normal, straightforward repair of liquid cleanup and keyboard replacement.

Highlights of the lackluster service:
- Day 0: 8/29: computer brought in for repair, told it would be ready "around next Wednesday, 9/5".
- Day 7/ business day 5: phone call in to the store on 9/5: "We don't have the part, Thursday, Friday at the latest"
- Day 8/ business day 6: drop in to the store close of business Thursday, 9/6: "We don't have the part. I guess no one brought it over from our other store. Friday, Saturday at the latest."
- Day 10/business day 8: drop in to the store Saturday at opening: "I'll fix it for you in an hour."
- Day 10: drop in to the store two hours later: "It's not ready, we got really busy. We'll fix it today." Also, this gem, from the clerk working on a phone while a customer waited: "this woman's phone is really important, she needs it right now". Well, I'm sure the woman who dropped her phone five minutes earlier felt that way, but so did your customer who dropped her computer off ten days ago. It was an inappropriate and false statement of customer prioritization. No call when my computer was actually completed. Thanks.
- Day 11: I call them. The computer is apparently ready, but the store is closed. Someone offers to meet me there, but I opt to wait until the store is actually open so that I don't have to coordinate a specific meet up time.
- Day 12/busines day 9: I pick it up. I am quoted the full cost of the repair. I request and receive a discount, but no apology for the poor service. At least it appears to be working.

I would not recommend you bring your computer here. They are either understaffed or totally disorganized and not at all sympathetic to the importance of the objects they're servicing.
