So, not bad for getting to do laundry at 2am in Harlem, and the prices are pretty damn good: it was $3.25 for a triple-load washer, and the dryers are cheap. However, when I came to get my clothes out of the dryer, there was smoke pouring out of it, which continued for some time, and my clothes were so hot that after 10 minutes of sitting with the dryer door open, they still burned my fingers. So, plus on the hours and prices, but beware smokey dryers. You probably don't need your clothes to be in there very long. Clearly.
