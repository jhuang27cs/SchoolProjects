Meh....meh....meh....

Eating here looks like a good idea, I mean it is on campus, the line isn't too long, they do have "fresh fare" that is cooked differently daily, and the environment is decent too.....BUT the food is just not really a good idea other than convenience... I don't go to UT but I went here to grab lunch and their premade sandwiches are just blah. No real flavor, not very big.....they had these shrimp sushi wrap kind of things too but the girl I was with wasn't too impressed with that either...this is just a campus eater basically but with a facelift....

Kind of like a monet---looks better from far away ya know?? It smells good, and maybe if I had ordered some of the things off of their fresh menu I would have liked it better, but their enchiladas and stuff that were sitting there also just did not look appetizing.....it just looked like it had been sitting there for quite some time...

lesson, bring your lunch to campus if have to eat here a lot.....
