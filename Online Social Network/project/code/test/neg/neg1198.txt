yuck. there is a reason people pay to have restaurants cook for you. if i wanted to choose my own ingredients, i would stay home. and if i wanted to get salmonella...well maybe Id go to Fire and Ice. 

Im sorry, I know this is supposed to be part of the fun of it, maybe im a stick in the mud, but the prices were way too high, the food is grotesque, and the process of getting your meal prepared and cooked is not fun (can you say stress).

*mmm nondescript red and/or white sauce on vegetables and overcooked noodles with meat thats been handled by other patrons....
