I want to like Chipotle, hell, I like anything that competes with Anna's Taqueria; however, I cannot in good conscious recommended this place when Border Cafe is less than 100 feet away.  The menu is incredibly simple.  Start with the filling: beef, chicken, steak, etc.  Then choose your style: burrito, hard taco, soft taco, salad, as well as the nonsensical burrito bowl and fajita burrito.  Fajita burrito:  Meat, rice, peppers, onion, guacamole, sour cream, cheese...if I was at the meeting where they were trying to figure out what to call this contraption I would have suggested a "Burrito with no beans."  Granted I'm a dumb consumer, I mean it, MIT and Harvard aside when it comes to people trying to sell me things I fall for all the tricks.  Magic Bullet chop-o-matic, yeah I have one.  Sham-wow, yeah I have two.  I would even buy a snuggie (the blanket with arm holes) if some dude came up to me and had it.  However, I am smart enough to know know that if I don't like beans in my burrito I can order it without them.  That aside the food just isn't that great.  Also, not that you should care, but the inside is all light wood and steel/copper giving it an modern-industrial look.

Bottom line: Someone out there likes lime rice? Just walk the two blocks to Border Cafe.  If you are too tired I am sure some passerby would be glad to carry you if it meant striking back at Chipotle.
