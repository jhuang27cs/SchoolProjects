So a few months ago, I decided to head to In-N-Out for some grub.  Since part of me was getting tired of In-N-Out, I decided to try out Buck Fiddy (I'd been hearing about.  I tried out their beef burrito and chili burger.  Both of them were very plain and didn't live up to the hype.

This was around 3:00 PM so there wasn't much of a crowd, but the order took a good 10 minutes. 

The food was cheap though, so I suppose if you're on a budget, you could try it out.    

Parking is... difficult.  If you're not going to pay for the nearby parking lots, then you're going to have to find a meter.  If you live in the area, I suppose walking is probably the best way to get there.
