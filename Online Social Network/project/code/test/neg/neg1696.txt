I was really surprised when I went to Wagamama.  I've heard about Wagamama for ages (since the chain is expanding to more and more locations on the East coast) and when I went I was expecting to get a reasonable bowl of noodles,  because... how hard is it to make a good bowl of noodles?

But the noodles I had were greasy - so greasy that the flavor of the oil competed with the (barely) spicy Chili Man sauce.  There was a pretty large pile of noodles on the plate, but there was no presentation - it was just a pile of noodles.  The Yasai Itame also suffered from excessive oil, this time floating on top of the most generic vegetable broth that I have paid $10+ for.  Neither of the sauces had strong flavors - the salt and sweetness balance was NOT right.  Each dish tasted like a muddled combination of flavors, rather than a thought out menu item.

The melon juice (which is actually apple, orange, and melon juice) was the highlight of the meal, and I would have been more excited if it hadn't cost $3.95.

The service was okay - kind of fun to watch the waitstaff run around typing.  Though being asked multiple times if we had received all of the food was a little off-putting.

I'm glad that I went - because now I can happily schlep across the city to some real noodle restaurants and enjoy delicious Asian style noodles without any lingering doubts about Wagamama.  (Its important to know that real noodle shops make really good noodles - some actually have legitimate ramen in the ramen noodle soup - but not here.)  If I can't get to a good noodle spot, I'm staying home to make some ramen on the stove, because then I'll get noodles that have flavor.
