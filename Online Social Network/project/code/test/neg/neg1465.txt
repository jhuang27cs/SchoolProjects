Food has been decent but recently has gone WAY down. Friend of mine recently related a typical Pertutti experience:

Tortellini with Brodo soup was like dishwater with uncooked tortellini. Peas in the pasta sauce were still frozen. Bread was decent.

Of course the service is NOTORIOUSLY BAD. I have experienced and witnessed the following scenario multiple times:
"would you like dessert?"
"sure, I'll have the tartuffo"
(five min. later)
"I am sorry we are out of tartuffo"
"okay I'll have spumoni"
(five min. later)
"I'm sorry we're out of spumoni"
Lather....rinse....repeat.....
You are better off hauling your ass to the dessert carousel in the back and checking it out for yourself.

My friend also had to ask THREE times for the bill. Then of course another ten minutes goes by as he waits for change (the restaurant is deserted at this point). Waitress is sitting near the bar, chatting and refilling creamers. Friend gives up and asks for change at the bar. Waitress cuts him a look. Friend's mild manners are spent at this point:

"Don't you cut me a look. I waited longer to pay for my meal that I did to eat it. I'm never coming back." He threw a wad of three dollars at her and left.

UPDATE: Pertutti has closed, and supposedly the owner, a blows-with-the-wind kind of guy, has decided to go into tattoo laser removal. Apparently while the restaurant started out strong, management and cooking staff were beset with various personal crises and the place completely fell apart by the end. Opening soon in its place under new ownership is "Campos", which also seems to midpriced, Italian-themed.
