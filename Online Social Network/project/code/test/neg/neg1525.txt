Wow, I had SUCH high expectations of this place. I'll preface my bad review with a disclaimer that I went during restaurant week and the place was packed, so I can forgive some errors - a forgotten drink here, a long wait between courses there? Not a problem, I'm a pretty easy going person. 

However when our server tried to force the sea bass in front of me insisting it was the halibut that I ordered I was a little suspicious (my dining companions had one of each, it's not like I had nothing to compare it with and was somehow confusing my fishies). 

Then one of my dining companions was given the poblano rellano or something like that instead of the lamb she ordered. The server proceeded to explain that the kitchen would not prepare the lamb without the cheese and nuts (which causes my friend to break out in hives, it's not optional!) so she "brought this dish for her instead because she could eat it".  

What and WHAT?!??  

I received the halibut within minutes and my friend the lamb (sans allergens sprinkled on top) however I swear the menu did not mention the ginger sauce on the halibut, ICK.... I should have ordered the sea bass!

Oh and the "warm chocolate cake" appeared to be freshly out of the freezer.

And too boot, those long waits between courses pushed us past the 3 hour limit for validated parking.

Loved the parsnip soup and my friend's meals looked interesting. They do the 3 course meal deal year round too. I won't be going back anytime soon but maybe you'll have a better experience!
