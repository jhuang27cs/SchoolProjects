Here on vacation, had a lovely dinner in Old Town, looked for a nearby theater at which to see Hugo.  I figured an AMC had to be a pretty decent standard multiplex.  Wrong.  Parking is a problem -- highly congested.  Lines for tickets are long and slow (unless you go downstairs, go past the ticket taker, and buy your tickets inside -- you figure it out).  Seating is not slanted, so you don't see over the head of the person in front of you.  And the last ten rows in the theater remain brilliantly lit up by floor lighting which is a huge distraction (except to insiders who bring their own material and lay it out on the floor to cover the lights...).  This place is packed, so there must be a reason.  I suspect the only game in town.
