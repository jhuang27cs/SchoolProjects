Made reservations for Valentines Day as the 3-course menu sounded delicious.  The place was cute, however it was extremely cold when we got in there.  They sat us along the front bench and my husband sat on 'non-wall' side.  This was terrible as the floors are old and every time someone would walk behind him, he would bounce all over the place.

Most importantly, the food was blah.  The appetizer and salad were good, but the entree's were cold and had a very weird-to-bad taste.  Dessert was blah as well.

They did give us a gift card when I told the waiter (who only came to pick up the plates after we were finished) that I would have told her to replace my entree b/c it was cold.  That was somewhat good, however I just don't think I'll even use it.

On to better finds in Austin!
