I'm very disappointed. Yesterday, I went to pick up my son's second birthday cake. I had ordered a train decoration with animals... what a surprise when I opened it at home, and I did not find the animals, just an empty train. The birthday decoration and favors are all about animals (the same I had chosen for the cake).  Now, they said I never ask for the animals... 
Too late to fix all the sadness and mess for the SUPER HIGH CAKE I paid...  119.00 dollars for a small cake.
