A small corner shop with a wonderfully kind owner, this is a convenient place to eat in Berkeley. The food here is humble and the ingredients are nothing special. But for college students or summer program students (as in my case last summer), it's a place of nostalgia where you can have some hearty and filling Korean comfort food.
