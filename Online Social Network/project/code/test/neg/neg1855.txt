So my 1 star wasn't enough to show you I'm not a fan?  Actually, the star is for me because I returned.  Sadly.

I enjoy their Alameda counterpart, so I thought I'd give the one in the asian ghetto a chance.  Most Japanese restaurants can get away with $17 for a mouth watering plate of fresh sashimi, but not for this hole.  

What I ordered: Salmon sashimi dinner

What I got: Overpriced frozen salmon over shredded daikon.  Their menu says all dinners include rice and salad, right right?  I had to prod the old man to include salad, AND he forgot the rice.  Moron.

I broke my cardinal rule of returning to bad eateries when I went back for a second round of disappointment.  This time, the salmon was mushy,  and my dinner came with soup but still no rice.  And yes, I had to request salad again!  

How does the saying go?  First time, shame on you. Second time, harakiri me?  

Sushi from the ghetto?!  Think about it.  It's disgusting, and so is this place.
