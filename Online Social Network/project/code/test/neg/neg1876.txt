Nope. 

I sent the la primera chica here for a Mother's Day package including a Massage, facial and spa mani/pedi. It was not cheap, but not bad ($220 before tip). There is a painfully small selection of full service spas downtown: Chestnut's was fully booked, and I didnt know of the Red Door. So, I booked at Spadyssey.

When I picked up my lil' lady friend, I could tell it was off. Of course, she didnt want me to feel bad, but I know reactions...like when we lived in San Fran and I would give her a spa day. She would literally be breathless, come home and nap, and spew forth the praises of the myriad pampering she had received. Not here.

They told her the regular massuer was out on maternity leave, so they had a stand in, who may not have been an actual licensed massage therapist. Her facial was reportedly good, but the pedi was a disaster. They  plop a do-it-yourself pedi kit in a wooden box with soapy hot water, and give bare bones pedi. No tootsie massage, no soak, no salts and oils, nada. Just a shitty pedi. Same with mani. And they only took like 15-20 mins a piece, which left her waiting 45 mins for the other services. 

No tea or champagne, no robe, no aroma therapy. Just a rushed, impersonal and unprofessional spa experience.  Pretty lame, look elsewhere
