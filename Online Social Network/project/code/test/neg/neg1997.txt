They have a decent cocktail selection. I haven't really tried the food but my overall impression is that this place is striving for the feel of the Jolly Pumpkin, except with more Vanderbilt and less whimsy.  This place is also quite loud, so come prepared to shout.

I can say that the cheese plate is hilariously small and comes with crackers rather than bread. Also the cheese selection was bland and uninspired, but the honeycomb was a nice touch.  Based on my experience I doubt I will ever try dinner here, so it may be moot.

The main turnoff was the quality of the service. We sat at a cleared table and it was not wiped down. The person who sat us caught this ad wiped it down, but still sticky and awkward. Them three of the four sets of cutlery at our table were dirty, with crusty bits of food on them. This is unforgivable, cutlery typically has to go through the hands of the dishwasher and then someone else who makes the rollups, suggesting that they were really asleep at the switch here.

What really irritated me was that  I told one of the servers about this and asked for new cutlery and she pawned me off on another server rather than dealing with it immediately... even though the cutlery roll ups were right behind her at the service station. I don't care if a server is in charge of my section or not, something as gross as this needs to be dealt with right away. Our server eventually showed up to address the situation, with a mitt full of loose cutlery that was deposited unceremoniously on the table without rollups.  

All of this is fine for a bar (and we were drinking and didn't care) but not at all for a restaurant. Turning to the bar aspect, their cocktails were decent. They tend towards older classics and are quite strong and not sweet (which I like). If you are into this sort of thing, it may be worth a try, with caution.
