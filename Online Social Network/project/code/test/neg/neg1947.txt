What can I say; I just can't get into this place. 

While I appreciate that there is anything vegetarian to eat at these kinds of places (especially when I don't have a choice in going), grilled cheese gets boring fast. They have that, but it is completely forgettable and the only other items I saw that were in fair play were plain salads and fried thingies (zucchini, mozzarella, fries, sweet potato fries, etc.). This is Squirrel HIll in Pittsburgh, not back-woods West Virginia. I would like to think they could muster up even something as pitiful as a veggie burger from frozen, but no such luck.

Most recently I went here during a work lunch with a vendor and the service wasn't the best. Our waiter forgot my drink, forgot sauce for my food, forgot that the girl I was with asked for napkins. Perhaps forgivable things, but that plus a vibe not caring put me off. If you are on a tight lunch schedule, this may not be the place to go. Things came out pretty quickly, but I'm not sure you could be in and out in 30 minutes or less. This restaurant is pretty small and I would definitely not suggest trying to fit a group over 5 people in for a meal.

Now, after saying this, I'd like to add a little asterisk: this place probably isn't that bad for non-vegetarians. The food looks good and my work-mate who eats meat loves a few of their dishes. This is one of those reviews that is definitely for vegetarian-eyes-especially.
