Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, or maybe I was having a bad day.. but this place deserves a 1.5 star rating.  I think I rather take the $8.50 I spent on a focaccia, basil mayo, Turkey BLT sandwich with avocado and a bag of chips and spend it on 2 footlong tuna sandwiches at Subway's next door.  OUCHIES! I noticed only the elderly from the retirement community next door, and business people were eating here (no college students, bad sign?)

The focaccia bread must have been like 2 days old, because my jaws sure did get a work out.. EFFIN' hard to chew!  I've had good focaccia bread.. and i would even say the foccacia at Splash is way better (not as good as the ones at Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store Cafe in SF) Maybe all I needed to ask was them to grill it.. Nah.. it musta been day old bread.. 

Where's the Beef?  Or in this case, the turkey?  I got like 2 slices of turkey. Wow.. $8.50 and.. this was pretty lame..

Overall, overpriced.  Their cakes might be good.  I had their cupcakes before.. too much cream cheese in their frosting.  But who can say, they've had a bad cupcake?  I say skip on to better sandwiches at Lincoln Deli Market, or High Street.  They are priced the same and are far more superior!
