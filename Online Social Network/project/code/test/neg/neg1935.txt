OMG possibly the worst experience of my life.
Extremely small, crowded club with barely five feet of floor area in front. Floor is sticky and more than likely, you'll get a drink spilled on you. Cover fee is ridiculous and I hear it's even more jacked up on special occasions like Homecoming and Dad's/Mom's Weekends. Better check the band that's playing before or you'll get stuck listening to country crap like "Cornmeal." Ridiculous, deadbeat hippies rocking out to lyric-less songs.
