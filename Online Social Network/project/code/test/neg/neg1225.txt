Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.

The beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.

The best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting.
