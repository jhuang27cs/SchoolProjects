Vroom .... zooooooommmm .... screeeeeeech!!!!
It's 9:00 AM and I'm trying to get to a work site, but cars thinking they're in an F1 racing series are barreling down car-cramped ramps and stopping too close to me to allow for a decent turning radius.  I can't believe there hasn't been an accident here!

I hate this garage.  ZipCars live here on the bottom floor (P4).  In the ZipCar world, this garage is otherwise known as Kendall/Genzyme.  The reasons for hating this garage include:
  + It takes 15 minutes just to get out of the garage
  + The allowable turning radius at each level is only enough for ONE car and what's worse is that they can't see you since the last person parked in a row of cars along the parking ramp is a m-er f-ing HUMMER.
  + The crash potential in this asshole garage is so HUGE.

GET THE BASICS
Kendall Square is all about parking garages.  You can find one practically at every street corner.  So where is this one?  Once you cross over the Longfellow (S&P Bridge), take a right at the first traffic light onto Third Street.  As you approach the new Third Square Apartments Complex and right after you pass the Watermark Luxury Apt Building, hang a right onto Kendall Street.

GET THE FACTS
It's a fancy 1,400 car underground, four-level garage, which provides parking to corporations, residents, shoppers, and contractors.  Check out the website for garage rates.

BE FOREWARNED
Corporations out there: I don't suggest you send your clients here unless you want them to freak out.
