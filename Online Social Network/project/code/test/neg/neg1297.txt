It was a tough decision to make. Go for the authentic Ethiopian restaurant, or what seemed to be an appealing BBQ. The Menu for Blue Tractor  won us over, and we decided to check it out. 

I'm not one to talk about interior ambiance and overall feel; however I thought Blue Tractor did a good job.

Since we already had a 30 minute wait, we ordered our food right away. The waitress was brilliant. She was on the ball, and wasn't reluctant to show a genuine smile. I ordered a small basket of the corn bread as an appetizer. Lets just say, it was the worst decision i made. Its description on the menu makes it sound a lot better. When my "Cowboy Reuben" arrived I had high hopes. The size was perfect, and the fries were loaded! It looked scrumptious! Of course I had to ruin the moment by trying it. It was awful! Sure it didnt taste like plastic, but there was no flavor. It was "blah" I was forcing myself to eat it up, luckily I used some of the sauces provided to drench the meal with some character. My friend ordered the Tractor Burger, and the meat on this was simple and carried no flavor. 

Compared to Smokehouse Blue's, there is no comparison worth attempting. The beef brisket from Smokehouse Blue's murders that from Blue Tractor, even the BBQ sauces are kick ass! If you want a better dinner then check out Smokehouse.

To sum it up, I would go back to Blue Tractor only to admire their menu and salivate to their meals; but I wouldn't be foolish enough to ruin the moment by actually trying the food.
