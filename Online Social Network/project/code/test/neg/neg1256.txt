Very cool decor and a nice spot to peoplewatch if you sit by the window. But the part of Forbes between Murray and Shady must be cursed with untasty food spell (ice cream and donuts not included). I tried the egg rolls (tiny!), tofu fried rice (eeeh, I make better tofu at home and I suck), and fried banana and coconut ice cream (YUM! for ice cream, banana - eh)

With this, I give up reviewing Pittsburgh restaurants because I don't want to sound like Debbie Downer in ALL my reviews.
