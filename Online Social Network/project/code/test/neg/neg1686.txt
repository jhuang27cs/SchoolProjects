We went to the 3PM showing of Tinker Tailor. First, $ 11.00 per ticket?? .. Are the costs so much greater than the other Hoyt house ... where a ticket is $ 1.50 less and runs a special on Tuesday nights for all seats for $ 6.00! Manners and polite treatment of your clients over 40 years old is not a bad idea especially when the average age of this completely full show was in the area of 55 years - 65 years old! Now to the show itself ...great movie ...not one bit of heat in the theater .. ice cold .. half way through ..outdoor coats being put on once again!!
After the show.. a required visit for personal moment ... again ... movie staff ... when asked a question .. just answer .. not assume!  Parking garage in and out experience ... a horror show including two long lines to pay before departing with automated machines with no easy access attendant to assist in the process! Then on the way out, the gates get stuck and require an attendant to assist in departure. Looking forward to my next visit!!
