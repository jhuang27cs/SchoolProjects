The Ferry House used to be our favorite restaurants, notice the term 'used to'. 
My wife and I had been a pleased customer of this restaurant for about 6 years dating back to 2004.  We can always count on an excellent meal every time we visited.  We noticed the quality of the food and services had declined in recent years due to change in management, but our most recent visit in July was the last straw. 
The night started off fine with our waiter giving us the dinner specials, but everything went down hill once the order was taken.  We spent half of our nights swatting flies that were buzzing around our table, we did not see our waiter again until he came back to take our dessert orders, not once did he come back and asked how our food was.  We had to request a different waiter to open our wines that were on the table on multiple occasions.  The icing on the cake was when I asked him to put a birthday candle (my wife's birthday) on the dessert, another waiter brought out the dessert and just threw it in-front of my wife and walked away.  I am not sure what our Waiter's mentality was, maybe he thought this is a party more than 6, I am guaranteed 20% tip, and I don't need to pay attention to their needs.  He can't use busy as an excuse because the restaurant was half empty.  Overall, he was rude, inconsiderate and certainly do not deserve the gratuity that was indicated on the check. The food wasn't as good as it use to be, and it tasted extra disappointing due to the horrible service we received. 
I am not sure what changed throughout the years, but this visit had certainly been our worst.  This was our favorite restaurant in Princeton and we often recommend friends and family to visit this restaurant when they are around town.  After our most recent visit, I am afraid my above statement no longer holds true.
