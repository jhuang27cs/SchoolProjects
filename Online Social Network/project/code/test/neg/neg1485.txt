The service here is really bad.  Several times I tried to call and place a phone order and then I was put on hold for abt 5 minutes.  I'm trying to save time by ordering ahead and they take forever to get back on the phone so I hung up.  I just got frustrated and went in to place my order and it was not busy!  There was like 1/2 the capacity of what it should be so it was rather slow and they still could not pick up the phone!  I think they have too many people behind the counter doing absolutely nothing which is frustrating as I had to wait yet again to place and receive my order.
Some people there who were new were nice, I hope they do not develop the work ethic of the senior staff who clearly do not know what they are doing...
