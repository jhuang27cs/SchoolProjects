SHADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Maybe we were unlucky, but we definitely had one SHADY waiter. 

First off, it was the first time my 2 friends and I went to this hookah lounge, just because it looked like there was a decent amount of people. 

Secondly, our waiter was really creepy and kept trying to be all "friendly" with my friend, telling stupid jokes and making us "laugh." 

When he asked us for what we'd like to drink, we all said "water." And he shadily kind of said under his breath "okay that's 3 bottles of water." I heard it, but didn't really think anything of it because he said it so softly and wasn't sure if he really said bottles.

Then when he asked what flavor we wanted, we told him "strawberry." And he kind of looked at us weird as if we ordered something weird. So I asked him, "okay what is one of the most popular flavors?" He then said, "white peach." And we said "okay we will get white peach." But thennn, he points to another table and says, "see everything is freshly made here. You see that fresh apple? You will get a fresh apple as well." Not knowing much, we just agreed. 

After we got our hookah, he brought us 3 bottles of water. They looked really small and cheap, so my friends and I kind of shrugged it off and assumed the water was probably like a $1 or something.

We also ordered fries. 

Then the bill comes along, he then cracks some wise ass joke, "oh I added champagne in there." (which was to be funny about how high our bill was." 

We look at it, and each bottle of water was $2.50 each!!! Not only that, that "fresh apple" was also an extra charge!!!!!! UGH!! Our bill came out to be about $45 with the fries and everything. WHAT a ripoff. And he tries to be all clever and funny!!! I'm never coming here again.
