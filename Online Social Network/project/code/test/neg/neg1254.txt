I've been looking for a nail salon to be my regular place, so I booked a porch mani and pedi at Julep.    My friends said it was nice but expensive.  After sinking $80, I was disappointed.  I was there for over 2 hours, and when I left I shortly realized my fingers still weren't dry.  Within 2 hours I gave up and removed the polish.   Maybe the worst part was that the woman that did my mani and pedi did not make me feel welcome and pampered.  I thought this place was about atmosphere?   She mumbled a few words to me the entire 2 hours and then disappeared never to return when I was done.    I didn't think the chairs were very comfortable and the decor looks worn.    Just not what I expected...
