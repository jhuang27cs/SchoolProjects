Still waiting on my repair. My Macbook screen was starting to crap out, and after going to three different Apple repair places (including the Genius bar) I decided on this one because their quote was the lowest. To start with, the guy gave the wrong diagnostic: he thought the problem was the inverter board, but then realized it was a faulty LCD screen (after my laptop had been sitting there untouched for six days already). They called me to tell me that the total price would now be doubled because the part was more expensive. I have been calling back repeatedly to get more information on when the part will arrive. It has now been a week and a half since I dropped it off in the first place. 

As people have said repeatedly, they have lazy, crappy customer service and do not keep you updated on your wait time.
