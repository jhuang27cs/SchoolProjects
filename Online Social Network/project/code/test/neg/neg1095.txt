I'm from the Bay Area, so I was excited to see Ambiance in SLO, sadly I was disappointed at their meager selection of items.  The sale selection was not tempting in the least bit and the other items were not unique or basic enough to fit into my wardrobe.

Another reason to stay away: the building has not yet been earthquake retrofitted.
