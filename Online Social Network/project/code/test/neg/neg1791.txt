We'll start off by saying that we LOVE Back Abbey - Union on Yale, however, leaves much to be desired. This place has SO much potential. Really cool set up - the building, the bocci, the outside seating - it all totally works - but the menu and the food itself needs some serious upgrades. (1) We found the menu to be a bit too pretentious. (2) The portions were way too small for the price.

Might be a nice place to grab drinks. We might come back to try the pizza as most have given that ok reviews.
