weirdest thing i have ever tasted award goes to.... momoko! i just finished my first momoko pearl milk tea and wow. wow not because it's awesome. wow because i feel like i have just taken drugs. seriously. i'm ill. i'm super dizzy and feel as if i may fall down (if i werent already laying down). the store itself is a great experience. the ladies that work here are super friendly and helpful. the menu is hilarious. instead of describing what's inside of each drink, it describes how each drink will make you feel. for example one drink said it was so fragrant that "it will not make your face scrunch up like when you smell a sharpie, but will make you smile like when you see a golden retriever." haha the descriptions where worth the trip. but not how sick i now feel. i had the razzberrry milk tea w/ bubbles and my husband had the chrysanthemum milk tea w/ bubbles. both were hand made with real fresh brewed tea and mine had actual fruit in it. the boba was softer and had a different flavor than i have had before but was nice. they don't make teas like smoothies though so the ice is whole in the drink. very wierd, very potent and flavorful, VERY sweet, and now i feel VEEEEERRRRY sick. i don't know why i like bubble tea. it is like little pieces of poop at the bottom of your drink. but i do like it. my husband just came out of the bathroom burping and moaning thanking me for dragging him here. your welcome! buyer beware. it sounds like you may get more than you bargained for at momoko. which is hard cause you'll pay so much. the end. sorry momoko, i want to love you, i just cant because i feel so bad.
