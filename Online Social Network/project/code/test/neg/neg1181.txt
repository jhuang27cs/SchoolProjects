I kinda hate Telegraph Avenue. I hate the tourists and clueless students who walk painfully slow and take up the entire sidewalk. I hate the Environment California people who try to solicit me for money when I'm on my lunch hour. I hate the street punks who spit insults at you when you don't give them money even though they're clearly not disenfranchised. ("Awww, you ran away from your home in Walnut Creek because suburban upbringing was just too suffocating? What a tough life!") I hate the ever-lingering stench of body odor and urine. I hate the in-your-face dudes that hang outside Rasputin and yell at you if you don't take a copy of their crappy demo CDs. 

And I hate that Telegraph clearly used to represent something, and that something is long gone. 

But I keep coming back. There's no getting around it. Can we please uproot Amoeba, Peet's, and Intermezzo and plant them elsewhere near campus? kthx
