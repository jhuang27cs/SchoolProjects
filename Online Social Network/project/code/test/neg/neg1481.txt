Just took delivery of an order of ( jumbo?) wings that I saw on special. I was told that it would take 45 to an hour...way off.luke warm food,the guy on the phone seemed lost and I was overcharged. Not going to bother calling back because the only thing that was ok we're the breadsticks.
Better step it up soon folks! This is a pizza lovin town.
