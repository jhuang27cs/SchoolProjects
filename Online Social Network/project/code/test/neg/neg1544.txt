Oh....I'm sorry.  Did I just walk into the Sigma Nu house?  Does someone have a humidifier on in here? 

This place reminds me of drunken, impromptu dances parties in the basements of frat houses.  Smells weird, Everclear a-flow'in, disgusting bathrooms that make you with you packed a body condom to wear and just crawling with ridiculously bad dancers humping the air.  

The bad dancers provided enough entertainment and laughs for me to give this 2 stars instead of one.  (Yes, man dressed in head to toe in yellow...I am talking to you.  What were you doing to the wall last night?  It kind of looked like you were trying to clean it, or massage it or something.  But then you moved on to the pole...which was even better...I mean worse...I mean more entertaining.)

Most important not of this review:  the DJ BLOWS.  Probably the worst DJ EVAAARRRRR!  The transitions were, well, nonexistent.  And the choice of music was just bizarre.  Was it Madonna Madness Fridays and I just didn't know it?
