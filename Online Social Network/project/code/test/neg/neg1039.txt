After being a loyal customer for so long, I'm so fed up with how rude the servers are. The wait time is horrendous during peak hours. And now they started charging gratuity when I dine in...for one person.

One of my worst experiences I've had here was ordering one of their dishes with the tilapia. There was a stray bone in the fish that got stuck in my throat, and I had a really fun night after that...
