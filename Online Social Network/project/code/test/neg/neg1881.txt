Jerry's is an LA classic for no real good reason. Maybe the large novelty menu really struck a chord with people some years ago, and the mentality has continued to stick.

Yes, they have some good items, but really not worth the prices. Super expensive! And every time that I've been here, the service has been terrible -- no matter how empty the place was. 

I think that the tour guide hype around this place is uncalled for. Although if you like stuffed cabbage and don't mind paying $16 for it, go for it.
