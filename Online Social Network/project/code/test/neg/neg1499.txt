Really long lines.  Poor and confusing ordering process.  You order directly from the guys on the line and it's a bit rushed so there's no time to ask questions or anything.  The chef puts WAY too much garlic on EVERYTHING.  That is practically all we could taste.  The neapolitana was almost inedible.  We left most of it there.  

I probably will not be returning.  Definitely underwhelmed.
