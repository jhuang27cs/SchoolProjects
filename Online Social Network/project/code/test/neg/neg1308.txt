Seems like a great place for a pizza place. Walking in, it smells wonderful! You can watch them prepare your meal from the bar stools. 

Problems seems to mainly be a disinterested cashier. Luckily, I found a few "to go"menus with descriptions resting on the bar. Sadly, they were more help than her. Pizza is good but the salad was lack-luster. Perhaps, I simply ordered the wrong thing.
