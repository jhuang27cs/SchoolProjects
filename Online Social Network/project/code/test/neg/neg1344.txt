Honestly, Trudy's is a-ok for the non picky texmex eater. I personally thought it was mediocre *at best* if even. I've definitely had a hell of a lot better food than I had at Trudy's. 

Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad food at all-- it just wasn't anything special by any means. It's not something I'd go out of my way for at all, there are hundreds of restaurants exactly like it that serve pretty much the exact same quality of food.
