This is within walking distance of Magee Women's Hospital, so I decided to take a chance and try. I was hopeful upon walking in, since the restaurant is dingy and dirty like many good Asian restaurants, but I was pretty disappointed by the end of the meal. The samosas are made with phyllo dough, and they tasted okay. I'm from Malaysia, so I decided to try the Malaysian style fried rice, and I have no idea what style from Malaysia they're claiming. I can't even describe in words how far off-base the fried rice was from what you really get in Malaysia. I realize the exact ingredients and flavors may not be the same as overseas, but whatever I ate wasn't even close. I have been to other Asian restaurants who have been able to produce a dish close enough.

The service is okay, although beware that the aunt who is your waitress doesn't speak English very well. Her nephew, who seemed to run the business (since he handled the money), came over to apologize about her poor English. He then proceeded to have a conversation with me, but I couldn't hear or understand him very well. I'm usually pretty good with Asian-accented English, but I was at a loss. 

American Express is not accepted here (primary credit card company for corporations), so I probably won't return.
