I love the Target brand and enjoy shopping there: a place to buy guest designer clothing and bleach in one stop?  Yes. 

This City Target underwhelmed me.  I hated the parking lot lay out and the fact that the store is in the basement.  At first I didn't even know where the elevator was it just isn't a good visual layout.

The shelves were very organized and everything is very new and shiny.  

Everything is scaled down and they do not have certain departments that the bigger target stores do.

It's closeby but I would probably go to a different Target store in the future.
