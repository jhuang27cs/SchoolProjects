Being from San Diego, where there are a lot of good places to go for Vietnamese food, I have been on a search for a good, quick, and cheap Pho joint in Boston for a few years now. I was hoping to find it with Le's in Harvard. Honestly didn't think you could mess up Pho and would not usually review a place like this. However, this place disgusted me so much that I had to write about it.

The food is below average. The broth hardly had any flavor and the noodles were way overcooked. You can probably expect this kind of carelessness from a place like this that has no problems attracting business, but they won't be getting any of my business anymore.

The last straw came when I noticed a bug on my lettuce, which comes with the spring rolls. Unfortunately that wasn't the worst part. When I notified the staff, the waitress proceeded to inspect the lettuce in front of me and told me she didn't see it. Maybe I should be thankful she didn't try and return the plate to me. Unbelievable.
