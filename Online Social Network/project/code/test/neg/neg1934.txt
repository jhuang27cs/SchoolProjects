Moved to NY, largely to get a handle on this DR. Now this is my neighborhood drugstore. Every person who works here is in a terrible mood all the time. I tried to fill a prescription here once and failed miserably as the pharmacist told me with great alarm that he couldn't do so because my insurance had deleted me as a customer (nope.)

Never fear for my well-being--Rite Aid straightened it out after an afternoon of rainy shuttling between the two pharmacies. Other customers were not so lucky. While I was waiting at this DR to find out what the deal was, another pharmacy employee was informing a young (obviously Columbia UG) guy in line at the register next in line that he had no more refills remaining on his prescription.

"That can't be true," he said, politely but firmly. "Do you have the bottle I brought in this morning? That should say how many refills are left." 

"Don't know if we have that anymore. I can look. Tell me what your medicine was again," the attendant said.

He bent over, fumbled a scrap of paper from his pocket, wrote a name, and handed it to her with some obvious irritation.

"This says PROPECIA, right?" she yelled.

In general, I can get in a mindspace to enjoy how extraordinarily cranky everyone is here when I'm just buying gum or whatever thing, but if you take semi-embarrassing medicines and/or they are somewhat important to your continued health, this Duane Reade's pharmacy may be troublesome in those regards. The aforementioned Rite Aid at 110th bent over backwards to untangle the web this pharmacy weaved, for what that's worth.
