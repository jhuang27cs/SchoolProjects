The food is really good here. Sometimes I eat at their main restaurant on Rosemead called President Thai.

I question the cleanliness and sanitary conditions of Prez-2 though. Twice when I ate there and went to use the restroom, which was itself disgusting, there was a trash size clear "bag of raw meat" that was sitting right outside the bathroom door. Clearly they don't get that defrosting meat at room temperature is a health hazard.
