Let me tell you about a little incompetent man named David. The so-called "Assistant Manager" of this location, David is anything but helpful. 

When my friend and I went to print a 30 page document on 80-lb paper, we had to blow through SIX attempts of wasted paper to get this machine to work, all with the assistance of an employee. The employee (who was super nice and caring, just a tad lost) said that the wasted copies were of no use to her and we could just keep them because they were not our mistakes. After the sixth attempt, she had no choice but to refer us to her manager.....Here we go.

He takes all of the messed up copies, tells me I have to pay over $200 to keep them or give them back to be shredded, and tells me that I will need to pay $130 dollars to make the three copies I originally came in for. I remembered the other lady giving me a quote of a little over $60 dollars, and David could/would not explain to me why the cost more than doubled. 

So after arguing countless times, I give in. I return the wasted copies so they can shred the wasted paper/ink. I decide to only leave with TWO copies on WAY thinner paper. I let David take over, thinking he can get the job done (even if he is totally rude), and return at 8 p.m. to pick up my purchases. 

The purchases were done correctly. This is the one and ONLY good thing I have to say about David. So I pay my 70 bucks and leave.

Then I realize that he never gave me back my flash drive (which holds my entire project). I call up to the store, speak with David directly, and he tells me that he (and I quote..) "ALWAYS gives flash drives back and NEVER forgets." I almost start crying at the thought of losing this flash drive, tell him to look again and call me if he finds it. 

I go up there, and it is very clear he never looked for my flash drive. It is still sitting in the back of his computer.....


I HATE DAVID AND I HATE THIS LOCATION. The end.
