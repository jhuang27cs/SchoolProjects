I haven't heard as many of my friends tell me to go to a restaurant in a long, long time until Chipotle opened up down the street.... I have never been to a Chipotle and I had to try it.

It was late at night when I went there, the lines weren't that bad and I thought the service from the people behind the counter was really nice.  They offered me to taste two meats before I decided which I was going to have.  I loaded it up with the Carnitas and some shredded beef with spice (forgot the name).  For the other toppings I went for rice, pinto beans, corn salsa, green salsa, and the light tomato salsa they had, finished with lettuce, cheese and sour cream.  

Before I took a bite I was looking around the restaurant's environment.   I kind of like how Chipotle was set up.  Reading their philosophy on food quality from the back of my coke I warmed to the burrito I was about to enjoy...  the result disappointing.

The burrito had no major flaws and I thought that the meat was good quality.  The reason I didn't like it and ended up giving the restaurant 2 stars (ok I would have actually given it 2 1/2) is that in the middle of LA there are millions of Mexican restaurants.

What I love about eating Mexican (or any ethnic foods) is that it is an experience.  The language barrier, the surprise with the meal, the different spices and choices of menu items, trying something new - all of this compiling the true Mexican food experience. Then you have Chipotle sitting in the middle of it... lines huge wrapped around the restaurant (every time when I pass it).. giving you a solid Tex-Mex meal with no pop or passion.  I have been to many, many cities whose idea of Mexican food is the yellow cheese that never is in a solid form and for Chipotle would teach them something about Mexican food but with all that surrounds us... there are other options... and I am happy to take them over Chipotle.
