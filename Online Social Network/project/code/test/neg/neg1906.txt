What was I thinking for coming here?!  I guess I was in a seafood mood, wanted to give this place a try, and considered it since they accepted Passport cards.  Should have went to McCormick & Schmick's instead.  At least, we got OpenTable points for it.

It started off kinda bad when it took forever for our server to come take our order.  It was 15 minutes after we had sat down so I was getting irritated especially since I was hungry.  For starters, we had 1/2 dozen fresh oysters and a half order of calamari.  The half order was plentiful.  For dinner, I ordered the Seafood Saute and my husband ordered the Fried Catfish.  After we were done with the appetizers and was waiting for the entree, our server came back to tell us that the chef didn't want to serve the catfish as it wasn't looking too good so my husband had to choose a different dish instead.  He went for the Ahi Tuna dinner instead.  

Our food came out looking pretty good, but the taste was nothing fabulous.  The Seafood Saute had dungeness crab, scallop, prawns, with rice and green beans in like a lemon butter sauce.  The sauce was pretty heavy and was all over the seafood that I wasn't too thrilled about it.  My husband's ahi tuna was more cooked than raw so he wasn't too pleased with his dish either.
