this place is a definite bargain to go to especially  if your a college student  on a budget! I had a very O.K experience the lines are long but not worth the wait especially if the person taking your order just ignores you and gives you the wrong order! They need to hire more efficient staff and more people friendly cashiers. The cookies were like chips ahoy packaged cookies  and way too sweet! I DEFINITELY WAS DISAPPOINTED  I WAS EXPECTING MORE DUE TO THEIR REPUTATION.
