When Cafe Cezanne closed and this opened up, I was excited. At first the enthusiasm was warranted - the baked goods are delicious, especially the strawberry oatmeal scones. I love the coffee, one of the few brews that don't require sugar and milk to mask the bitterness.

However, a few months after opening, things went downhill. I had an arugula salad that was so doused in dirt I actually thought for the first few bites they had poured too much nutmeg on it, because how could there POSSIBLY be so much dirt? (I was spaced out from writing a thesis, so give me a break.)  The space got dirtier, too. The service is slow and weird. Only sometimes do you get what you ordered.

I like the menu and like the space, but when such potential slides into such poor reality, and stays there for years, I no longer hope they'll improve. I really wanted them to succeed. Now I'm kind of wishing they would just close up and give someone else a chance. Central Square needs what they are trying to do, but done better.
