The sandwiches are decent, and the pizza is only so-so.  But the wait is terribad.  I've gone several times now, and each time I've ordered a sandwich, I've had to wait 20 minutes.  Sorry, I just don't have that kind of time.

If you're after a good slice of pizza, do yourself a favor and hit up Armando's or Pinocchio's instead.  If you're looking for a good excuse to soak up the air conditioning in the holyoke center... well... that's as good a reason as any to come eat here!

I really miss the place that used to be there...
