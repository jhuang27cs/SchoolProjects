The food tasted good, until i found a hair embedded in my burger. First I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and be quiet about it; I picked it out and continued eating. Then I realized that wasn't the only one - there were at least ten more. They were literally embedded in my burger and fries. Because they weren't merely on top of the food, and because there were so many, I knew this couldn't have been an accident. DO NOT EAT HERE.
