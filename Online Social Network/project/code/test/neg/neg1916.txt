Well My food was pretty good, so the 2 stars. My wife's food was somewhat dry so we asked for extra sauce, and this took 15  min to come out. The excuse given was that all the sauce was made fresh. Really? You don't have some basic sauce available int the kitchen?  Also, even though our waiter was very diligent, he was assigned too many tables, and the result was fair minus service. Not going back.
