extremely different than the original downtown location.  If this wasn't MOD I probably would have given it 3 stars, but with such expectation from my love of the original the U-Dist location falls short.  I have been there twice, both times offered the same experience -- 
1. heavy cheese, so heavy that it slides right off, or it sticks to the paper as it fills the fresh cuts by the slicer and you could potentially eat the paper - yuck! ( I did by accident)    
2. service is still quick, but employees don't seem confident in preparing pizzas (not as cool as the people downtown).  why would I be excited to eat something it seems like the person didn't know how to make?
3.  crust rises too much.  they stuff all pizzas in one oven together since they do not have multiple ovens like the downtown location.  this seems to affect the crust making it more doughy and leavened. I like it thinner with a light crisp.
4. good amount of seating for the tight space.  the booths require shifting the table to one side or the other in order to get in comfortably. on cold days sitting in the main area could be uncomfortable since the unit is open to its outdoor seating.
5. no milkshakes on the posted menu! ( I didn't ask) , but they have mini wine bottles...cool?

I guess they are still settling in with final construction activity, so hopefully it will meet the original MOD's standards.  I will continue to dine at this location since I am on campus, but I will see if they can honor my food preferences by request.
