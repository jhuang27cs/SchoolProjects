As a Drexel University student, Mikey's Restaurant is conveniently located on campus but to much of dismay it sucks.  The chicken wings were not as good as the priced that I paid for ($20).  They make Spring Rolls with coconut in them which is gross.  Whoever thought of that should stop cooking.  Their drink specials are good.  Seriously, they need to bring back the owner of Ecco Qui (before Mikey's) cuz this place sucks.  I seriously advise walking to another bar like New Deck Tavern or Drexel's new restaurant bar Landmark, which is conveniently connected to the Drexel Rec Center.  They have better food especially Landmark because it just had its grand opening.
