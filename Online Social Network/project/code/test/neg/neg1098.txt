Really just alright.  The location is... fine.  The food is pretty good.  The prices are typical.  The service was very nice.  The sangria was terrific (filled to the brim and very strong).

I wouldn't come back here again unless I was starving and everything else in the area was full.  It's really just a bland sort of place.
