Earls is the kind of place you give either one star or five. Because either you are all about getting really cheap strong drinks and dancing inappropriately with other undergrads, or... you're not. 

There is nothing classy or even really interesting dive-y about this place. Its big, a little dirty, has pool tables, and shots are normal prices but quantity wise are least double shots, if not more. Mix drinks are half liquor with a splash of mixer. The place is empty and calm on a Thursday night until about eleven when it starts swarming first with desperate looking college-age guys (we estimated the male-female ratio about 3:1), and then by midnight the dressed-for-partaaaaying girls show up. There is a general break down of order which ends up in a grind-y dance floor, and making your way to the door involves lots of pushing and shoving through the droves of people crowded in front of the bar. 

One visit was enough for me. Now I have experience Earls, and I am ready to move onto bigger and better things.
