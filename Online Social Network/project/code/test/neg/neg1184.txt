This place used to be fantastic...just like once upon a time in college buying a millin pairs of American Apparel unitard seemed like a good idea.  Now not so much.  Everything about this place is old news, and anything that used to be good about it is fading fast.

Have you seriously ever been to a place where the sushi of the day is just plain tuna? thats like saying the pasta of the day is macaroni and cheese (kraft)...its not that it doesn't taste good, but its just not that special

the thai mussels used to be good before they switched from real mussels and started using rubber crap that  I find on the bottom of my shoes.  

The day we went and they had actually run out of the bubble "tapiocal" balls they put in the tea was probably the last straw.  I'm so dunzo.
