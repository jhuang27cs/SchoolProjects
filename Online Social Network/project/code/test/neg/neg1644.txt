I use to go the this place and dream about their grill cheese sandwiches. They use to be really cheesy, extra buttery. Just how you dream of a kick-ass grill cheese. I came back today after about 2 years... and its not  under new management but the sandwich was dry butter-less and had literally one slice of nasty American Kraft cheese. I was let down. Oh was I let down. I've experienced better from Kip's.
