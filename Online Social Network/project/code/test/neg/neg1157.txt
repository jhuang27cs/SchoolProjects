I bought something for my brother for his birthday at the Sony Style Store at Valley Fair, but he was not happy with this item.  I went to this store to return it within the 15 day return period.  

The manager was interrogating me as to why my brother was not happy with this item.  After explaining the reasons why, he still attempted to convince me not to return it.    What was the purpose of that???  If someone doesn't like something that you purchased for them, what can you do about it?  That is just how things are.  

He was so persistant that I almost blew a fuse.  Finally he gave the cashier the authorization to return this item.  I will continue to frequent the Valley Fair Sony Style Store, but I will not be returning to this store anytime soon because of the manager's bad customer service.
