Being its so close to the campus, I think owner is just not caring at all. Service is basically none existent, and food is okay at best. That is coming from a Korean. if someone else who are not familiar with Korean food comes here and try the food, I am afraid they may think thats how Korean food supposed to taste like.. well its not.
