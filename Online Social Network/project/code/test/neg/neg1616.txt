This place is a give and take situation. Every student comes here at least once in their Cal career. Professors always like to get their readers from here. The lines are huge when school starts! It is best to come in the morning when most people are in class. It is pretty much dead when readers aren't being sold. I came here to get something laminated once, so they do provide other services other than producing readers.
