Writing a yelp review of a single sbux location is challenging because if the store is being run by the book, it's going to lack an organic vibe (like any chain) which is not always a bad thing. In fact, I think this particular location is well-managed and I'm giving this store and sbux as a whole two stars for one reason only, consistency...that's it. Now for the bad news...sbux sells mediocre-tasting products at a very high price (read: ripping us all off). I worked for sbux for over a year and can tell you that the company honestly believes it's own bull#$it and loves spreading it around. Here's an example (from memory): "to establish starbucks as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world while maintaining our uncompromising principles as we grow..." This is part of the company's mission statement...FINEST COFFEE in the world...bull$%it. Has anyone actually tasted it! Ok...here's the Pepsi challenge. Order a small coffee from sbux (leave it black)...immediately get into your car and zip across 10th street to Octane on Howell Mill...order a small coffee there. Have someone switch the cups on you and with your eyes closed...tell me which one tastes more like the FINEST COFFEE in the world. Now according to Fast Company...sbux is going to help reshape the music business by selling "indie" music in the stores...WHY...what is going on in Seattle...why not focus on purveying the finest coffee in the world instead of further ripping off customers with point-of-sale impulse purchases. Argh, I hate bull@#it.
