I was in Boston for a research conference at MIT, and our flight arrived pretty late so this was the only place we found that was open. We ordered almost immediately and didn't get appetizers, but we should have because we were starving and it took them at least 30 minutes to get our food onto the table. 

I ordered a lobster roll which was just okay. They didn't skimp on the lobster. I think mine had an entire lobster worth of lobster meat in the filling, but it tasted pretty average and it was rather expensive. 

The service was pretty bad. There was a large group in the restauraunt, and I think they distracted the waitresses who barely paid attention to us. My lobster roll was supposed to be served cold, but my friends who ordered warm dishes got back lukewarm stuff like it had been sitting out for awhile before it was brought over.
