Recently, I used this vendor for catering purposes for an all-important catered affair.  Not only was the manager inconsistent with his pricing practices, but he used a rather hostile and demanding tone with my always-friendly coworker.  We nonetheless reached a compromise with this relatively unpleasant man, only to find our catering order much less than stellar.  The coffee arrived in old crusty containers with name tags that adorned the phrases, "Hello, my name is COFFEE."  "Hello, my name is HOT WATER."  The coffee was acidic and full of loose grounds that practically choked me, and did not maintain any significant sense of warmth.  And don't get me started on the pastries.  I like Costco well enough, but  if I wanted them to be served at this fancy affair, I would have driven my lazy ass to Costco and picked them up myself, and also been able to enjoy some free samples while I was there (which is one of the main reasons to go to Costco in the first place).  Needless to say, the food arrived freshly contained in their Kirkland packaging, and we served high-brow Picasso enthusiasts with muffins that have so many preservatives that they could last through the next World War.  I hope Peet's buys them out.
