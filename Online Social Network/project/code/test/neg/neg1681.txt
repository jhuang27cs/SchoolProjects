The last time I was at Amer's was back in the late 90's, with this visit I found the service was rude, no greetings no thank you, just take your money. When the sandwiches came they were good but not what it used to be and falls short from local competition despite being one of the more expensive joints... the place looks lacking of any leadership or care, the tables are dirty, the seats are ripped and walls are stained. That is unfortunate considering the restaurant was a major player in the downtown scene.
