Ordered online, so this review obviously won't cover all bases.

Got a burrito ($8.99) from this joint, paid extra ($2.00) to put ground beef in it. Delivery took about fifteen minutes longer than projected. I'm never offering a tip before the food gets here again!

The "spanish" rice was undercooked and flavorless. The beans, salsa and guacamole formed a disgusting, convoluted mash on the side. I paid for beef, but didn't see any - not that it would be easy to find if it existed. The burrito was primarily nasty rice, and everything else was a mess!

Absolutely disgusting, and a disgrace. One of those places where I don't ever want to see the kitchen. Never eating here again.
