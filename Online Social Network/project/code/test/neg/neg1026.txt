On a date in Harvard Square.  He wants Pizza, and I've already been to Bertucci's once that day.  He seems corporate-restaurant-minded, so he suggests Pizzaria Uno on JFK Street.  I think he's paying, so I go along with the whimsical plan.  Entering the establishment, we are seated immediately, at a two top table, with about 3 inches on each side from other patrons.  The server stood directly behind me when taking our orders.  He never asked how we wanted the steak cooked(yeah the date didn't even want pizza at this point), and never asked whether I wanted a ceasar or a garden salad.  About a half hour later (the place wasn't even packed) the food arrived via the arms of our beedy-eyed, 5 foot, creep waiter... I guess he assumed my date wanted his steak Medium Rare, and my meal came with a mysterious ceasar salad.  When the food arrived, our glasses were empty, and the creep dropped off our food and disappeared so quickly, he didn't even ask if we wanted more drinks -- come on, every server knows to get in as many drinks as possible to up the bill and the tip -- We didn't see the little creep again until he dropped off our bill during a swift power-walk-by.  The atmosphere sucked, service was beyond terrible, and the food was mediocre and overpriced.  Not to mention, he didn't even pay.
Harvard Square dining tip Numero Uno:  Avoid the Uno all together.
