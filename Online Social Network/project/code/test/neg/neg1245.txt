I would normally not write a bad review but today bothered me so much it needs to be out there. 

I often dine alone. I walk the East Side and found Duck and Bunny on one of them. I checked them out online and was excited to see crepes and high tea. 

All was fine, I was seated and a menu was brought over. On a day that  just brunch is served, it should be stated. An entire menu is presented but you can only order from the back page. I was confused as well as the table I will speak about in this review.

I ordered an ice coffee and tea sandwiches. I read my book. Minutes went by. The table of 4 that ordered right after me, was also waiting for their food. The server checked on them several times finally explaining the kitchen was backed up. I was never spoken to. 

Both owners (I assume) came over as well. They took them mini cupcakes. Then they presented them with their tea sandwiches. I still waited. No one talked to me. 

Then I received my sandwiches which were thrown on my table. The table of 4 cancelled the remainder of their order. They had to leave. They were given a GC to return back. No one talked to me. 

I finished my meal and I was asked if I wanted my check. Not how the food was, not how I ate without a napkin, just you want your check. I paid. I did leave a tip, of 20% on the full bill. My intent was to purchase cupcakes but decided against it for obvious reasons. 

I will also say, I had intended to return that week with my mother for high tea. 

I dine all over Providence. This fails not because of the food but because of their service. It was disrespectful. I wish them luck but unfortunately bad PR is so much worse than good. Treat your patrons the same. 

Let me also say, the table of 4 because of the cancelled order, their bill came to the same price as mine. They were parents of their college kids. I live in Providence. My tip and business would have been worth the extra attention.
