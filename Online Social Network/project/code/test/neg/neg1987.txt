Have been here a couple of times over the years. Seems to have lost its luster, and I'm not just saying that because of some of the other negative reviews. Ordered the Panang Curry Chicken for lunch and found it very mediocre. This place automatically loses points from me for serving their chicken dishes using sub-par dark meat rather than white meat. The dark meat gave off an unpleasant odor and the meat's texture was hardly appetizing. I don't think white meat should be an upgrade option....it should be standard at any eatery worth the time.
