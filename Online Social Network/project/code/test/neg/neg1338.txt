I got my first tattoo done here in January 2002 - I just walked in, picked flash art from one of their books and got it done by an apprentice tattoo artist. It was a pretty simple design - two roses - so I wasn't too concerned that he was an apprentice. It turned out pretty well, so I'm happy with it. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, the front desk staff are not friendly. Maybe they're just sick of all the Harvard kids or something? Also, their prices were pretty high, which I only realized later. Again, I agree with the reviewers who noted that permanent art on your body is not something to do on the cheap, but their prices could be lower based on the quality of their work and the experience in their shop.
