Is it really so hard in a city the size of Atlanta to have reasonably good Asian food in Midtown?   

I like the location of Mu Lan and the cute house it is in, but the food is the same as one would get in a suburban strip mall in Anywhere, USA.  Disappointing....

I know my standards can be high (I lived in southeast asia for a few years) but, really, why is it so hard for a city the size of Atlanta to get some good ethnic food that doesn't require a drive to Buford Highway?
