Food is decent.  Service is an atrocity.  We waited for 15 min for a table when it wasn't that busy, and had to ask for refills on our coffee multiple times before we actually got them.  My sandwich was okay, although the portion was rather small for the price.  The fries were crispy and hot, though.  The breakfast options are usually pretty good, but do tend to be on the pricey side.  We asked for separate checks, but they forgot and would only split the check evenly because they were "busy".  Not that big of a deal but still a bit annoying.  I mean, you did agree to give us separate checkswhen we first asked.  I would just head down the street to PJ's.
