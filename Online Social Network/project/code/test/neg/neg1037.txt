I absolutely love pad thai in general- and HATED it here.  I tried to make it better by mixing in some spicy sauce, but that didn't work at all.

My boyfriend a had a curry dish that he enjoyed.

I'd be willing to go back and update my rating if my new dish was tastier and I definitely wouldn't order the pad thai.
