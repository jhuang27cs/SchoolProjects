SLOW, SLOW, SLOW...Went here last Friday, group of 6 of us.  We arrived around 7ish and were told 20-25 minute wait.  About 35 min later, we got our table.  Took another 15 minutes for the guy to get our drink order. Another 15 min to deliver the drink order.  We ordered a few flights but this is a brewery, right?  They should be able to quickly turn this around..NOT.  
Ordered Pretzel appetizer and blue cheese chips, again 15-20 min wait.  Then the food order, another 30 min.  We spent over 3 hours here just trying to eat dinner.  Sorry but the food was not good enough to make me wait that long.  It was ok but nothing to write home about.
