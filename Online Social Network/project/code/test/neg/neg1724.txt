here's the thing about being a vegetarian.  if you want to avoid being a vegetarian of the douchebag ilk, you try to be an agreeable vegetarian.  this means that i usually say yes whenever someone suggests a restaurant.  i'm sure i can find something on the menu that i can eat, whether it be a grilled cheese, or a salad, or something.  i DO draw the line at outback steakhouse, but i think that's actually for reasons other than the fact that it's a steakhouse.  

ANYWAY, there is literally NOTHING vegetarian on the menu here.  i would recommend to the owners that they have at least one thing.  another thing i would recommend to the owners is that they train their staff to not have arguments with each other in front of the customers.  it's awkward.  my last recommendation is to start making food that tastes better.  i couldn't finish my meal because the taste was so bad, and i got sick immediately after going here.  my partner normally has a huge appetite, and he couldn't finish his food either.  and he still feels sick a day after.  he's not picky at all, but while we were finishing up our meals, he said to me, "Let's never come here.  Ever again."  haha no problem babe!
