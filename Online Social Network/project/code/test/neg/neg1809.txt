Ahh, Harry's Bar and Burger, where to start? With the slow service? The uncomfortable atmosphere? The smelly waitress? No. All of these seem pointless when facing the fact that the place doesn't serve burgers. You heard me! HARRY'S BAR AND BURGER DOES NOT SERVE BURGERS. Sliders, yes. Burgers, no. These are not the same. A fact that some folks have overlooked, I suppose. 
One night, craving a juicy burger, the hubby and I ventured out away from our regular haunt (not sure why, in hindsight). Thinking we could get what we sought, we drove straight there, found parking, and entered the bar. We were handed menus and I looked at that thing for what must have been 20 minutes. But I couldn't for the life of me find one, single burger. Facing near starvation, we ordered. They came, those tiny morsels of overcooked meat with miniature toppings. I at once felt like Alice. I looked around for the shrinking potion, but I couldn't even get the bartender's attention to order another drink (or a fork for my chili fries, for that matter), let alone some concoction that would render me the size that would magically change this bite into a meal. Digging his fingers into the basket of chili fries, he turned to me and scowled, "this place makes me feel like an animal."
What's more, the 19 year old at the bar next to me, drumming along to every song on the radio and talking at a decibel for all to hear, wouldn't stop ranting about how he likes being a civilian much more than a soldier. Don't care, Skippy. Now go finger blast your girlfriend at Prospect Park. I'll be at the Ivy Tavern having a real burger.
