When it comes to restaurants, there's quality, service, price, and ambiance.  A good restaurant needs at least 2 of these things going for it.  Noda only has 1 - very good quality sushi.

I realize I may come off as superficial, to give a restaurant only 2 stars when I admit the quality of sushi is good.  But the place definitely lacks ambiance, and the service is just meh, and the prices are as high as any Beverly Hills swanky joint.  It definitely doesn't look like one.
