When I lived in Boston a few years ago, Brookline Lunch was my go to spot for Saturday brunch- good food, inexpensive prices, cozy atmosphere, friendly service.....so when I planned my visit to Boston after 2 years, Brookline Lunch was at the top of my list to visit- 

My boyfriend (it was his first time here) and I arrived and were seated immediately - I was happy to see that the menu had remained the same and the same family was still running the place.  

However, as much as I loved this place back in the day, I must say that this time I was very disappointed with the food.  Perhaps the quality has gone downhill over the years....or maybe I just didn't realize it so much before.  I ordered the vegetable omelet - it was served with the eggs on the bottom, then the veggies and finally topped with American cheese (of all the cheeses to choose from- why???).  I also found the choice of veggies odd- carrots and eggs....hrmmm....My boyfriend ordered the french toast which was made with white bread- with cinnamon on top - instead of mixed in with the batter.  He found the dish rather tasteless and bland.  

Unfortunately, I spent the rest of our meal convincing my boyfriend - 'no really, it used to be good back in the day, I swear!'.  Service, however, was good, and the decor just how I remembered.
