Au Bon Pain is expensive and not big on customer service.  I mean, they're friendly enough, but all they really do is take your money.  Not only do I have to butter my own bagel, but they add insult to injury by making you slice and toast your own bagel, as well.  I may sound uber-picky, but I am.  With all the options in the Comcast Center, I decided I am done with this one.
