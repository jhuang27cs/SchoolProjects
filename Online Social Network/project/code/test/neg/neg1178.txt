*Note: Because I've been told that my reviews take"too long to read", here's a quick and easy summary of my experience at El Torito's Taco Tuesday happy hour: 

ES NO BUENO! ¿Por qué? 

- EXTREMELY crowded 
- EXTREMELY understaffed 
- EXTREMELY hectic and forgetful servers
- EXTREMELY small tacos, even if only for $1
- EXTREMELY weak margaritas
==================================================
I'm sure the other appetizers are much more filling (if not as appetizing), and on a less busy day the service is much better but honestly this was a waste of time and money. I might come back some other time, but DEFINITELY not for their acclaimed Taco Tuesday Happy Hours.
