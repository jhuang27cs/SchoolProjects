Twisted Taco, you left me disappointed and a little ill (sorry inside joke)

TT I've hung out with you before so I knew exactly what I was getting into, the loud music, rowdy crowd, over capacity of people. I didn't bargain for the cattty girls that seemed to accompany you this night, but very happy we received the hot guys ;-). 

I'll probably only visit you, like this time, as a last minute, spur of the moment type of thing. Hanging out in a small, hot box of a room isn't really my ideal place. Sorry Twisted Taco, we're just not meant to be.
