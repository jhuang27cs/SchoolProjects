My boyfriend and I dined at Yummy Maki Yummy Box for a 9:15pm dinner on vacation in La Jolla. Yummy Maki Yummy Box is a hole in the wall of a shopping center. One large bottle of Sapporo and one bottle of Nigori was served immediately. Complimentary "Miso Soup" was unavailable and substituted by a bowl of teriyaki flavor and chives soup was tasty. My boyfriend and I were rushed to order by our server. Our "Rainbow Roll", "Spicy Tiger Roll", "Holiday Roll" and complimentary "Spicy Tuna Roll" arrived in five minutes followed by the last call. I specifically requested no mesago on the "Holiday Roll" and it arrived including extra mesago. The sushi pieces are large, sloppily prepared and lack freshness. The entire six tables of patrons exited the restaurant, my boyfriend and I remained inhaling our $50 worth of low quality fish and alcohol and the employees of Yummy Maki Yummy Box stood and stared. At 9:50pm my boyfriend and I exited the restaurant followed by the employees of Yummy Maki Yummy Box to describe the time it took to meet health and cleanliness standards.
