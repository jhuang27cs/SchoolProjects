I was hungry and wanted my food right away. It ttok about an hour to get my food, so I was seriously raging! It wasnt busy in there at all. On top of it, the waiter made me feel bad about getting a refill on my refillable soups..it was only my second round -- geesh!

Okay food, bad, slow service = bad review.
