All I can say about this restaurant, is don't go!! 
My family and I just moved here to the area by way of N. Cali- 
So need I say more about the terrible beef burrito I had; tasted 
like they cooked the meat about four hours before we got there and left it sitting in the pan for the flies to lay eggs in!! The salsa was really weak!! 
The service was a negative 10 on that scale!! 
So is there any great "Mexican Restaurants" in this area of Indiana state?!?
