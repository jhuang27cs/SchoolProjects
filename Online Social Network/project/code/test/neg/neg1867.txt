Like Jenni K. and Jen F. mentioned, the location of this place is terrible.  It took a while to find a parking space because it was so crowded with all the other businesses, and it's inside of a really sketchtacular mall.  When I went, the selection of cross stitch supplies was mediocre at best - they were all out of plain black embroidery floss, and the rest of the flosses were completely mixed up and not in the right bins (so for all I know they had a ton of black floss in the bottom of the wrong bins).  The store had the general look of slight disarray throughout, but I headed right for what I needed and then left without doing much browsing.

Since I live in the city, there isn't anything in the way of jack of all trades craft stores like Jo-Ann that carry my cross-stitch supplies, so I might be back here out of necessity - if you have the means though, I would highly recommend their Falls Church location over this one!  Their store seemed to be neater, and they had ample stock of everything I needed.
