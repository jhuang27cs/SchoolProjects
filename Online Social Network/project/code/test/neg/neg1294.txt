This cafe always seems so empty but I decided to go against my better judgment and grab some food because it's the only place really open before/after a certain time.

I wanted a light meal so I figured I would get a chicken salad (SF Soup Company was closed). I order then get my meal and it's LITERALLY a platter of bbq chicken with some pieces of lettuce stuck on. In no way did it taste like a salad because it was smothered in fatty oil and sauce. 

Other than that, the guys working there seemed bored and lonely because they were all smiles when they finally got a customer.
