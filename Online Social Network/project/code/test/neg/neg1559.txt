Overall, the food at Max's is good.  However, the service is TERRIBLE which is why I rated Max's a 1 star.  

When we were finally seated, we were not greeted at all by any workers (servers) passing our table.  After 10 mins of waiting for someone, we decided to flag down a waitress.  The waitress was kind enough to go ask who will be serving us.  It just so happens the waitress whom we asked was our server.  Why wouldn't she know her table assignments for the day?  So.....we placed our order and waited and waited and waited.

From where I was sitting, I was able to see that our order for soup, salad and shirmp cocktail were ready to go out.  The food sat for a good 15 mins until the waitress finally decided to get the food.  The restaurant was not that busy and the waitress appeared to have no "pep in her step" and took her sweet time.  The food finally arrived.

The whole time we were eating, no one asked us if we needed anything (and I did need more bread), nor did our waters get refilled.  So......food was eaten, but we still have yet to talk to anyone.  I had to flag the waitress down to close out our bill.  

When the waitress arrived, we asked if it was ok to split the bill 3 ways and she said yes.  Again, we were waiting and waiting and waiting for her to complete the transactions (again, no pep in her step) and she finally gave us our respective bills to sign.  What do you think happened?  She messed up......charging the wrong card the wrong amout.  

So in a nut shell, Max's needs to train their staff about greeting customers, and to wait on customers in a quick, yet courteous manner.  I would only go back to this place if I had 3 hours to eat lunch!
