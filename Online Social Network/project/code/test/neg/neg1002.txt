The attraction is -- what? If you like high ceilings, sterile decor, and are brave enough to eat from an open salad bar (in Harvard Square?!), then go for it. But otherwise, for a quick bite, a place to sit for a few minutes, or for a few groceries, there are many better options nearby.

This place does have great bathrooms though! And it's open all night.
