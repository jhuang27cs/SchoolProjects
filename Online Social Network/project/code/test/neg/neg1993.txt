The YD Tap Room is part of the Nassau Inn.  They're going for the historic pub look/feel with wooden benches and tables and colonial pictures on the walls - and it works.  I don't really eat here as the only vegetarian options are salad or a Grilled Vegetable Napoleon.  I usually stick with the beer, but my friends have eaten the burgers and such.  As for the draft selection, you'll find Guinness, Sam, Blue Moon, Yuengling, and Stella on tap, as well as some combo of the nasty Bud/Miller/Coors.  TV's in bar for games and live music on weekends.
