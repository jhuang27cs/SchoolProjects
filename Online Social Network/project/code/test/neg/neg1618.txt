How many Chinese people actually eat at China Gate compare to Great Lake or Chia Shiang?  Unless China Gate revamped their menu in the past 2 years, its actually one of the worst Chinese restaurant in the area.  TK Wu, Asian Legend, and Middle Kingdom all have better food and more authentic options than China Gate.
