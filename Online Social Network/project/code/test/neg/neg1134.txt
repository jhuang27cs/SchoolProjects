I will only come here on a late night when I am in need of food to soak up the alcohol in my belly.  Other than that, I'd rather go to the taco truck or Chipotle in Udistrict.  The food here is pretty oily and not that tasty.  But when its 3 in the morning, it probably doesn't really matter.  

I recommend their tater tots and churro.  You can never go wrong with tater tots.  And their churro is super cakey and sugary.  Yum.
