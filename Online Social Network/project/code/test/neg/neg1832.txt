Im sad to say, this place is ALL HYPE. 
I was in downtown LA , & I decided I would drive all the way to Westwood to check this place out, and I was truly disappointed. 

First off, the line was long, but moved very quickly. I went with 3 friends & all of us ordered ice cream sandwiches . The cookies were HARD, they didn't taste fresh at all. The ice cream was extremely bland, there was noting special about it, it tasted like Rite-Aid ice cream. 

The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars was because it was  cheap. I was so bummed, I expected this place to be amazing, but there was really nothing special about it.
