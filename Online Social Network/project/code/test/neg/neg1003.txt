Central location, reasonable prices and validation are all great.  But, they have GOT to do something about the antiquated payment kiosks.  They do not give change or accept credit cards, so after a recent event event at Zellarbach, I was stuck waiting for more than 20 minutes to pay.    Fortunately, I had cash.
