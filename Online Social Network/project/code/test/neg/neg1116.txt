This place is not good, but not terrible. If I was really hungry and right next to this place...I would settle for it; but ultimately that is the only way I would go back. I had sweet and sour chicken just to be safe and it was some of the worst I've ever had. The veggies were hardly cooked, the sauce was served on the side even though I ate it there, and the pieces of chicken were very very greasy. Like I said I would go back here, but only if I felt I had no other option (which you do). The egg roll was good and so was the sweet and sour sauce. Maybe there are some things that would have served me better but I doubt I'll take the opportunity to find out.
