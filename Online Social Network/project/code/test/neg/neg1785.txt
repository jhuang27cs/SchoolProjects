5 stars for the beer, 2 stars for the food!  First off, the beer is fantastic, and it is a severe disappointment that the food isn't.  Our waitress was super nice and helpful while we were making our beer selection, and the rest of the service was outstanding.  The food was a huge disappointment.  My husband ordered the BBQ sandwich and potato salad.  The salad was ok (nothing to write home about), but the BBQ was too sweet and it came out cold.  He was too nice to send it back.  I got the black bean burger and sweet potato fries, and it was salty to the point that I couldn't even eat half of it.  I love salty food, but this was completely inedible.  Same goes for the fries.  They were overloaded with salt.  I really wanted to like the food here because the beer is awesome, and I like that they try to use organic, local ingredients.  But I recommend going only for the beer.
