I think it was Shakespeare who said a man may smile and smile and be a villain. It applies in this case. This law office separated me from far more money than I can bear to say, and provided nothing of real value. As another attorney said, after reviewing what had been done, this might have been appropriate if I had a net worth of $20 million. My CPA, however, said that if I hadn't backed out of it I would've been in trouble with the IRS. Wish I'd never heard of this guy.
