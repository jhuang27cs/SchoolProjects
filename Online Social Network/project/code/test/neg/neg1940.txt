My hubs and I came here on a hot Pittsburgh weekend night in late July, meeting with two other late-20s couples.  The waiter seemed to be walking through sand, taking what seemed like hours to come over to greet us, take our order, and then come back with drinks.  I asked him if they had any citrusy white wines on the menu, and he just started reading me the wine list, verbatim.  Kinda rude....I know how to read, buddy.  I wanted a description, not a list of what you offer, which I'm obviously holding in my hands as I'm talking to you.  Luckily, I picked a nice Chilean sauv and my friend got a pinot noir.  We wanted to order food, but seeing how long the drinks took, we opted out.  There was only ONE other table outside and maybe two or three people inside at the bar, so I don't know what the delay was.  

At the end of the night, we split the checks and one couple had been charged for an extra glass of pinot noir.  We alerted him to it, and he darted off with the checks.  When he returned, the extra glass of wine had been added to OUR check.....like we wouldn't notice.  Each couple's check was like $60 for drinks alone, so we would have offered a nice tip (my hubs and I are 25%+ tippers as a rule).  However, his super snotty attitude when I alerted him to the red wine I DEFINITELY wasn't drinking, now on my check, pretty much made up my mind about tipping the guy and about coming back.  When I said, "I think you might have put that glass of wine on my check, and was drinking the white,"  he shot back, "No, I know exactly how much you drank."  

We went ahead a paid for the extra glass and left him under 10%.  What a jerk.  I will avoid this place like the plague next time and you should too.
