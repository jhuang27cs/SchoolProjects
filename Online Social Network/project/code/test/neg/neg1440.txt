Deli section: Rude staff. Recently I wanted to order a breakfast sandwich but there was no staff at that section. It was around 9am when I was there. I had to walk over to the other side of the deli section and asked a middle-aged lady with dark hair, "is anyone making breakfast sandwiches over there now?" She looked at me annoyed and said in a threatening voice, "OF COURSE THERE IS..." And then she went on and on mumbling for like 30 seconds. I was going to ask her, "wait, what?" and before I was able to do that, she said, "What kind do you want?" I was so confused the whole time. I wish I was quick enough to record her or at least her threatening voice as a proof. I really do not understand why she had to respond that way. And by threatening voice, I am not even kidding. I have received bad service before and seen staff having a bad day or something, but never ever have I seen anyone threatening me for wanting to make a simple purchase. 

Another time, I ordered some Asian dishes (chow mian and stir fried dishes) from the deli section and OMG they are so tasteless. I didn't know anything could taste worse than Panda Express. But Safeway wins on this one.

Selection: They do carry a good but basic selection of everything. That means, if there is a particular flavor or brand you are looking for, you will have to go to another Safeway.

They do have two parking lots on each side of the store, which is nice.

I am not sure if I will come back to this store as often. I will probably only stop by for a quick snack or something in the future.
