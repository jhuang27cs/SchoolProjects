Before I ever realized that Cambridge Cleaners did the on-site pick-up/drop-off of cleaning at the Harvard Business School, I went to them to get two pairs of new (expensive) jeans altered. Both pairs needed to be hemmed, one needed to be altered at the waist. One pair was to be worn with heals, the other pair with flats. They hemmed both pairs too short. Thus, the pair to be warn with heals (Rock & Republics) was salvageable. Unfortunately, the other pair (Sevens) was not.... I even took them to my parent's dry cleaner in Naperville, IL and while they tried, it was just not enough. Now, I'd probably be more upset if I had paid full price for the jeans, but if I remember correctly they were on-sale and I had rewards from my old Corporate AMEX. So, in the end I got one good pair of jeans for full price... 

Since then, I have been *forced* into dry cleaning with Cambridge Cleaners as it is the only reasonably convenient option for an HBS student. They have always done a fine job with dry cleaning, even on delicate pieces such as party dresses and thin, sparkly cardigans. The owner has made me sign away their liability for such items a few times. After my initial experience I was only willing to do this out of desperation, but thus far I haven't had a problem.

Therefore, I would say DO NOT get anything altered here... However, in a pinch the dry cleaning services do suffice.
