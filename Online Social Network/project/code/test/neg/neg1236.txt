I came in to get a cut and blow dry and was a little uneasy after the cut took only about ten minutes. Having curly hair, it's important to get a stylist that knows what they're doing, and I am extremely sad to say that mine clearly did not. Though the cut looked okay blow dried, the minute I washed it back to curly, I was HORRIFIED with the results. I usually have a side part, but the stylist cut it at a middle part (though I advised her against it), and I have since had to go to a different salon a- mere two days later- to get my horrendous cut fixed. 
Perhaps the salon may be good for other treatments, like makeup, etc. But when it comes to hair- the staple of any reputable salon- Aguayo falls short.
