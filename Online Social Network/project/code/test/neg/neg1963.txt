Got a deal from Amazon local for teeth whitening at Million Dollar Smile.  The technician was late arriving, and that was the least of the issues with this place. FILTHY, UNPROFESSIONAL, GROSS! Located inside a salon, using the gross kitchen space and a machine that was sort of broken. There was a lawn chair for me to sit in and a nasty vinyl chair for my friend who also went with me. Then the technician put gloves on and proceeded to touch everything in there and then put trays in my mouth. Afterwards, had to follow him to the bathroom to spit, (no cup, mind you, just running water from the bathroom sink!), and I'm pretty sure he was going to reuse the tray he used on me. Nasty lyric music playing loudly the whole time- very offensive. I would have walked out as soon as I got there, but I was just sort of in a dumbfounded state. DO NOT GO HERE! BTW- the whitening had no effect on my teeth whatsoever- waste of time!
