I've visited a couple of times for breakfast (i.e. pancakes and waffles) because I couldn't think of a place more affordable. The taste was okay; the food could possible have been served warmer. I was a little disappointed with the portion size; I still feel like I could have gotten more for my money. I'm sure the cafe has better performance with lunch and dinner, and I like how it offers several tea options. Patrons may enjoy the hookah.
