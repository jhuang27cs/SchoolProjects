This was one of the more uncomfortable movie watching experiences in recent memory.  I was generous and gave it an extra star because the IMAX screen deserves it.  In all its domed glory, the screen is massive and when the huge vista shots come across the screen it literally envelops you, floats you and you feel like you're going on for the ride.

What snaps you back to reality is the fact that you're sitting in the worse theater seats possible.  The seats and rows are entirely too narrow.  The seat provides no support as it's basically a covered wooden board - so you'll be entirely uneasy and your butt will fall asleep while you're elbowing for space from each side and fighting over the barely-there armrest.  

If you're watching a movie (as we did, Star Trek, don't judge), the only decent seats to get a good view are from the  four or five rows from the top, anything below will give you a real shiteous view.  Also if you're prone to light-sensitivity or have even a smidge of motion sickness, the screen projection might aggravate it.

And on a last and related note, why is it impossible to watch a mainstream movie in peace these days?  In the six years I've lived here, I've been unable to find a mainstream (read: not Ritz) movie theater where I can watch a movie free of fellow patrons' running commentaries, constant talking,  and cell phone conversations? Are good manners dead?  Even at the IMAX, I had to actually turn around, 45 minutes into the movie, after three people behind me kept talking to tell them to "Please be quiet".  

Now, I'm an easy-going chick, I'm young and every now and then I'm a rule-breaker, but hot damn!!!  Stay at home if you're going to narrate and make comments while I watch a movie I paid $12 for.  After all, this ain't the Bridge or the Riverview Plaza.
