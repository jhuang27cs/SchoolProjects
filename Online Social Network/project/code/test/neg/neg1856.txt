I don't know what's wrong with the service at this place...

I come there at 10:30 on a Saturday morning and I hear people clamoring in the back but no body comes out to take my order....I look around the store to see if the store hours are listed and they are no where to be found...what kind of an establishment does not list their hours?  

I drive to the other TapEx on Regents road and the same story...no store hours?

So I took my ass to the local Starbucks...








You have got to be kidding me if you think this place has good food.

It took 30 minutes for the food to come out and there was no one in line!  How is that even possible?  Are they thawing the chicken back there?

I have to say that the drinks are really good.  I don't know what they put in it, but the green tea is definitely distinct from other places that I've tried.

If you come looking for food, you got it wrong.  Drinks...maybe.  

Service is also good.  The poor cashier is always afraid when they take your order because they know you're pissed for waiting so long.
