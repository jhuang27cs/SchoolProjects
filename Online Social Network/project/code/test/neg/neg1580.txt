This place is closed again for the 3rd time.

Bring two dices and if you roll 3 straight doubles, you might just get lucky with great food. At times, I've had good quality food but that's rare. Throughout the years, we can see that its owner try to redecorate this place with modern contemporary buddhist style decor. But the service and food hasn't improve. I suspect their Cooks are on strike during lunch and dinner, but that's just my guess. 

I cannot whole heartedly recommend this place to anyone.
