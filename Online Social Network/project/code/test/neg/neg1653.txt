Pros: There are lots of options, and the portion sizes are big.  The ingredients are fresh, and the staff is courteous.

Cons: The food is only OK.  Every meat dish we ordered came out a little overcooked and tough, and there was way too much cilantro in almost everything.  And while the prices aren't exorbitant, it's not exactly a great value either.
