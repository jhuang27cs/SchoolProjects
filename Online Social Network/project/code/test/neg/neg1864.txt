I'm usually not that good with spicy foods. Picture an Asian girl, hyperventilating & crying uncontrollably, and you'll understand. Nonetheless, yesterday was my first time diving into the deep end of the kiddy pool- I got kimchi fried rice! :D

But other than losing my spice-virginity (yes, I realize how weird that sounds), I was a bit disappointed with Kimchi Garden this time! I went with a group of 6-7 friends on a Wednesday night and it was pretty crowded. In other words, it took almost half an hour to get our food! One of our friends picked up dinner from somewhere else; he ended up finishing ling before we had even gotten our food!

Kimchi Garden, your food and portions aren't bad but, man, could you be any slower...?
