I made a Yelp account just so I could leave this review.

I first got a taste of their sandwiches because of the Munch on Me promotion, and I LOVE their sandwiches. I think the taste is fantastic, and there really isn't anything else in Berkeley like this.

BUT, there have been 2 times when I have gone there to get a sandwich and the shop has been closed even though it was during open hours. They even have a giant sign on their window that says they are open until 3am on weekends! But I always find myself sandwich-less, and end up going elsewhere and being extremely disappointed.

If you're going to close up shop early, AT LEAST take down your sign, or change your hours permanently. I mean, come on.
