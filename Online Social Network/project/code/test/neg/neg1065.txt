Super upset today. Ordered a large black iced tea. Received a small black iced coffee. 

Me: "Oops, I got an iced coffee instead of a black iced tea." 
Him: "We don't have black iced tea." 
Me:"You had black iced tea yesterday."
Him:"We're out today. Do you want mango?"
Me:"No. Why did you give me coffee?"
Him:"Because we don't have black iced tea."
Me:"Then why didn't you tell me when I ordered?"
Him:"Do you want something else?"
No offer of refund or apology.
Me:"I guess I'll just have a bottle of water."

I am in customer service and this is not the way you do it. Done with the wrong orders, which is too bad because I love that spicy mocha.
