This place is terrible.  It is the only Thai place located inside Asian ghetto, and their pineapple fried rice is decent.  However, the service is terrible.  Twice I got literally yelled at/scolded.  Once because I didn't bus my dishes to the right location, the second time because I asked for chopsticks with my to go order.  I came here again post graduation after a Cal football game and got the special, and the noodles were dry and the food all in all tasted old, like they prepared all the food at the butt crack of dawn and didn't replenish it as the day went on.
