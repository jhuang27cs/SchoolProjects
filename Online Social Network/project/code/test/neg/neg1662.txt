We guys made a trip to Boston,MA this thanks giving basically to visit two friends of my husband. We 4 guys went here for dinner, one of those nights, the place is cozy, tables just stuffed in. Below average interiors/furniture. Not a good place for groups.

The staff was ok, took the orders fast and food came to the table within a few mins.

The Food what we ordered was like Indo Chinese, too much of oil in the entrees and the appetisers. We ordered like 5 or 6 appetisers (chilly paneer, chinese bhel, spring rolls, Gobi manchurian and 2 other stuffs) portions are just not enough for a person, trust me they are such small portions and the prices are way too too much. The entrees were average however bland and portions were medium.

The quality of the food was fresh and good.

The prices are super high, luckily we had a groupon so it was not that bad, anyways not worth paying so much.

The last and the best thing about this place, they have v.good & eye catching cutlery.

After having so many stuffs here we still had place for Ben & jerry's ice cream which was on the same lane :) :) :)
