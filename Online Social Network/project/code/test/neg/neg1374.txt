I was craving for soup and since i was only across the street, i decided that i would give this place a go. I decided to get the New England Clam Chowder in a bread bowl not knowing that we were given a piece of bread along with our purchase. Because it was really loud in there, i couldn't hear the girl telling me we got free bread with the soup. The girl that served me was really impatient. She made me feel really rushed even though there was no one behind me and she had a really sour attitude. But whatever. The girl that rang me up made up for it because she was a lot nicer and had actual manners. I looked aroundfor a place to sit, but there was none. So i walked out to find a bench to sit on and when i finally did i had the most difficult time opening the lid! my friend and i spent almost a good 5 minutes trying to open that stubborn thing. but that didn't matter. When i finally got to taste the soup, it wasn't as great as i expected it to be. I've had much bettter New England Clam Chowder. I was pretty disappointed. I expected the food to be much better than what i received.
