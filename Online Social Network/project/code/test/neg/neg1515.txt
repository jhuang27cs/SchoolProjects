I went to Central Coast Ob-Gyn twice to see the nurse practitioner at Dr. Yin's office.  She was very nice and I felt comfortable there, but on my two visits I never even saw Dr. Yin.  Also, this office has messed up my billing for BOTH of my appointments.  The first time they did not even bill my insurance and sent me a bill for $350.  The second time, they sent me a bill for a co-pay which I had already paid.  Things like this are really annoying -- I can understand making a mistake once but to mess up the billing for every single appointment I have had?  Clearly their billing department is useless.  Luckily we have since moved and I am now going to another doctor's office, which hopefully will not be as incompetent with billing.

UPDATE: I also requested that Dr Yin's office fax my medical records to my new Ob-Gyn in Orange County.  Even after repeated phone calls to remind them, they never did.  The lady I spoke to in the records department acted like I was annoying her and wasting her time.  Useless.
