Sprinkles seems to be more hype than anything. I have tried their banana cupcake, the red velvet, and a few other flavors. I was not impressed. Honestly, I am the person who licks the frosting off the cupcake unless the cupcake is a standout. Sprinkles does have pretty good frosting, but their actual cupcakes are just mediocre. They are fresh daily, but their tastes just aren't that good. The flavor of the banana seemed sort of dull. Also, they are expensive for a cupcake. I would rather go to one of the supermarkets and buy a cupcake. It is nice that they have the word of the day to receive a free cupcake. But, otherwise, I would skip it. Head over to Sigonas next door or one of the many bakeries at Stanford for a much more exciting treat.
