The burgers alone are 3 stars.

Personally, I'm not a fan of looking for the 1 waitress that's serving the entire restaurant. I've eaten at similar checklist-style restaurants before and generally like the style.. but.. (esp considering the price) I'd expect them to grind their own meat and make their own patties. The bison burger I had looked like something I could have purchased locally. I'm somewhat intrigued by their burger bowl and might go back just to try it. Basically it's a burger salad sort of thing.. looks good.
