Nauseating!!!!  I tried three different sushi rolls here - the philadelphia, the kobe beef, and the california dynamite roll. They all were extremely gross. The later being completely inedible. The calamari salad that everyone on here raves about was just mediocre. Not only is the food gross but its also expensive.
