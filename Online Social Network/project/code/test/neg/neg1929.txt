This store makes no sense! The layout is terrible. None of the products are placed in any logical place, so it's impossible to find anything. Staff isn't too friendly when you ask for help either. And they mislabel prices. The prices are overpriced too. The quality of fruits and vegetables isn't great either. But...the two stars is for the convenience of it being 24-7 and close to campus.
