I've been hearing such hype about this place since it opened so I was excited to try it.  I work close by so I decided to stop by for lunch one day with my boss.  We came at good time because right after we showed up, so did everyone else.  The decor is cute, very casual and friendly.

I ordered Bobby's Blue Burger medium rare with sweet potato fries.  It was definitely a knife and fork job cause the blue cheese was oozing everywhere.  The burger was cooked perfectly to my taste but the blue cheese and bacon was overwhelming salty.  The sweet potato fries were nothing spectacular, no seasoning or anything..I guess that's why they offer so many different sauces.

The burger and fries came separately, so I guess it's pretty pricey for an okay burger.  Not sure if I'd come back any time soon
