The stock is interesting, but the aisles are narrow and it's hard to browse.

The guy who's always behind the counter has always been weirdly rude/passive-aggressive when I have bought, sold, or traded books there. He's the worst thing about the store. He reminds me of a pawnbroker who reluctantly and contemptuously accepts or refuses what you brought in. 

I've spent a lot of time in used bookstores in Berkeley, Portland, OR, and Cambridge, Mass, where the bookstores have a much larger stock and more room to wander, and never did I encounter a clerk with such a negative attitude
