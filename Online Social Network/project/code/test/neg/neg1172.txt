I was really excited when this place opened up in my neighborhood, but the time I went there was only so-so. The restaurant interior is cool and modern. The pizza was a bit overpriced for the portions, and the crust was bland. The waiter went on and on about how thin it was, and it was basically a cracker. I've had plenty of delicious thin pizza (try Keste in the East Village) but this doesn't qualify. It was a bit disappointing.
