Just average.  I came here with two friends for lunch.  The first thing we noticed is the fishy smell, figuring we'd have to go back to the office with a fish smell on our clothes.  I ordered the Boat Noodle Soup, the others got the noodles with peanut sauce and the Tom Yum soup.  

The food arrived and the portions are enormous.  Upon first taste, my thought was "not exciting, but edible".  The pork balls (please rename these, it's not an appetizing name) were slimy and seemed manufactured.  All three of us agreed that the food was okay, service is fine, but we won't be returning. (note: all three of us are Asian so we know our noodles)
