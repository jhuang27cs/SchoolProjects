When Joanna first called, I have to say I was very pleased to have this follow up a week after coming home from the hospital. She helped us realize that we were underfeeding our son and what measures to take to help me increase my milk supply.

Several weeks later, I was still having nursing issues and decided to have a consultation with Joanna at PAMF. I must say I very displeased and upset after my appointment. While she is fairly knowledgeable, I found her bedside manner to be somewhat blunt and stuck up. She questioned the number of layers of clothing I dressed my son in. When I showed her the technique I'd been taught at the hospital, she said it was all wrong. That's fine, but it just came out in a very condescending manner. I felt like her way was the only way I should nurse. Even worse, when I asked her about my pump, I did not get very good information from her. She insisted I was wrong about the dials and buttons on current Medela pumps. I double checked on the Internet and at the store and found she had no idea what she was talking about. Shouldn't a lactation consultant know something about pumps?

When I returned one week later for a follow-up appointment, I politely told her some of the techniques she taught me weren't working and asked what I could do to adjust. She basically ignored me, saying that we should just focus on what works. It seemed like she was unwilling to address me if I challenged her methods. Personally, I just need someone more supportive than this and someone who will explain things to me rather than tell me not to worry about it or ignore me.
