Terrible experience as well. I just needed a screw to be put in. They told me to come back after 2 hours (!) because they needed to look for the right screw. I needed the glasses right away, but decided to leave and come back anyway, and only then did I realize that the charge was $15...for a screw!! I made it clear that I was surprised  and they rudely replied: it's not only the screw you're paying for, but also my trouble of looking for the right one (WTF) and the work I put in it. Horrible people. Despicable behavior. Greed greed greed. PS: I got the same job done in NY this weekend for FREE.Shame on you!
