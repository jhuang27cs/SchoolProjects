Everyone likes Dos except for me it seems, which is a shame since it's cheap, near campus, and the service is good. What can I say? The meat quality reminds me of The Jungle, the "spicy" sauces are incredibly bland, and everything seems to be soaked in puce-colored refried beans. 

The hilarious thing is how every item on the menu is pretty much the same...there is very little difference between the tacos, the burritos, the tamales, or anything else. Entrees are a lot better than the specials. The carne asada tacos, while very much not carne asada, are OK. The ambiance can be summed up with a description of the walls: pink and orange sponge paint. 

Dos Reales has a lot of loyal fans, but I prefer El Charro or Los Amigos.
