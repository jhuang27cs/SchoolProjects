Looking down at some recent reviews I'm seeing a trend here.  Like many of the reviewers, I am more local to the Grant Park location.  I will echo the sentiments of many people who have made recent reviews here.

I was there last Sunday evening on the roof top.  Service was abysmal, to the point where different tables of strangers were helping each other snag their respective servers to get their attention.

I ordered my favorite menu item, the Fish Stew.  Seemed oily in a way that I have never experienced that dish to be (at least at the Grant Park location).

The kicker was that my fish stew came with bread that had clearly been RECYCLED from someone else's plate.  This bread hadn't just been sitting in the kitchen a while.  It was as hard as a hockey puck, as if it had been sitting outside in the Atlanta air for hours.  

This 11th street location ain't towing the same line as the Grant Park version.  They need to shape up.
