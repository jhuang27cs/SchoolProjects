A lot of people love Pizza and Pasta but there are so many better pizza places on main Franklin Street. I find the pizza bland and not exciting. I have only sampled the pasta dishes and they are ok. The garlic knots are pretty dry and I don't really like the sauce. There is plenty of room for improvement.
