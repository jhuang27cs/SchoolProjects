This place was formerly the Crocodile Cafe. Same owners as Smitty's and Arroyo Chop House, so I had high hopes.

My coworker and I ordered and shared a pastrami panini and roast beef panini with curly fries and salad. The salad was tossed and had jicama, carrots, and pine nuts. Interesting combo, but tasty. The curly fries were so plain and not fresh. The pastrami panini was dressed with honey mustard aioli which was way too sweet and overpowering! The roast beef panini came with horseradish (yum) and onions (yum), except the onions were pickled! Gross! I did not like either panini.

My other coworker ordered a burger with fries. He wished he had gone to the Counter instead.

Before the DBA name change, I came here to order a fiesta salad (blackened chicken, roasted corn, tortilla strips) and it was delish. Is this all this place is good for? Salads?

I may be ordering the wrong thing, but how many times must I got back to order the RIGHT thing? The only thing I haven't tried on the menu is entrees...

Not sure if I'd come back, and I only work up the block.
