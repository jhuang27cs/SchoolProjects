The only good thing about this place is the strawberry hotcakes.  Here's the thing: the combination of sliced fresh strawberries, sour cream, and brown sugar is sheer genius.  I'll give them that.  But you can do the very same thing AT HOME.  And you can do it without waiting outside in the heat/rain/snow for 20+ minutes, having to have cash on hand, eating your meal sitting practically on a stranger's lap, or wondering what the strange sticky substance on the table is.  Oh, hey, and you can even brew a decent cup of coffee while you're at it.
