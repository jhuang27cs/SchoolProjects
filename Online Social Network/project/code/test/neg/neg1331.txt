I ordered delivery from Beijing Tokyo.

Pros: Cheap for the quantity of Japanese food; prompt arrival; good packaging (including plenty of chopsticks, soy sauce and little trays).

Cons: Low quality. Also, the Sushi Sampler I ordered was supposed to come with miso soup, which was nowhere to be found.

The main entree was the Sushi Sampler, which I ate as soon as it arrived. The nigiri looked great, but it didn't taste very fresh. (I'm sure there are days when it's better.)

The veggie combo was even worse. Sweet egg? Fried rice balls? Yikes. When I order veggie sushi, I expect, say, eggplant, green beans, and yam. None were to be found.

There was also a pad thai. I suppose you should lower your expectations for pad thai from a non-Thai restaurant. It was basically a big pile of tasty noodles, with not much else.

Appetizers: The spring rolls were cheap, but deep-fried and bland. An avocado salad was basically what you'd get if you stirred avocado, crab and mayo together--not bad, but not something you'd want to eat a lot of.

Oh, and there was a very lackluster vegetable tempura--soggy, overcooked, thin slices of vegetables.

The one (relative) high point was the vegetable soup: thick broth and a good number of tasty veggies. Not exactly an exotic delicacy, but you get lots of soup for the money (it's $4.50 and could be a meal by itself).

In sum: I should've ordered from Ginger Exchange instead.
