Nothing special.  Profoundly average.  "There are no droids here...move along."

Look, I have nothing hostile to say here.  The place was acceptably clean for an aging diner.  I ordered the lunch special this week consisting of their cheeseburger and choice of either fries, macaroni salad, or potato salad.  I ordered the fries.  I ordered the cheeseburger "rare".  On the way out the door, I ordered a slice of blueberry pie to go (not part of the special).

The service was friendly and attentive - they were not that busy when I walked in (a Tuesday around 3:30).  The order was served promptly.  The burger was cooked "medium" - NOT what I asked for, and it matters to me.  The overall taste was unremarkable.  It was okay, but not in any way memorable in either flavor or size.  And I really do not like having the meat overcooked.  I did not send it back because this was a test visit, and either they passed or failed.  They were not busy at that moment so it was hard to screw it up if they cared not to.

The fries were of the "crisp outside, soft inside" type.  Cut large rather than McDonald's thin.  They were not adequately drained, but not drenched, with an oilier feel than other restaurants.  Texture and taste were good.

The blueberry pie slice (consumed later) was good.  If homemade pie just out of the oven is 5 stars, this pie was a 4.  Crust was flaky, not commercial.  Filling was generous and fresh.  ($3.85)  I would return if I were close and craving pie.

Finally, for the regular price of $7.10 for the cheeseburger and $3.99 for the fries, I would not return.  It was simply not memorable or compelling.  Just okay.  Old school 50's diner.  A neighborhood burger joint, better than a chain, but nothing special.
