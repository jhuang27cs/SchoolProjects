First of all, my girlfriend and I went into the restaurant, having just moved to Somerville and wanting to try this place out as we'd heard so much about it. As soon as we walked in and were seated, our waiter came over, found out we didn't want any drinks (b/c we hadn't decided yet) and promptly handed us over to another waitress with no explanation. We figured it was because we're both 22 years old and didn't look like we had any money because he was over-the-top, ridiculously nice to the old couple in the booth directly behind us and the family of six sitting next to us. The food was decent (I had calamari, she had steamers, and we both had a cup of clam chowder) but it was nothing worth the price. There's much better chowder to be had up in Maine. Plus, when we finally did order drinks (mine a Black and Tan, hers a Guinness) we found them to be flat and the Guinness didn't even taste like it was from a keg. And they cost $5.25!!! And I'm pretty sure they weren't even a full pint. I have never paid that much for that size beer, especially when it tasted like Guinness from a bottle. There are dozens of good bars and dozens of very good restaurants in the area (I'm still upset we didn't try out the Greek Corner instead) and while the food here may be decent enough, it's not even close to worth the price and it certainly isn't worth the service. It's a terrible shame that so many people go here based on a name and miss out on the huge variety of great food that the area has to offer. I'm still upset and this was pretty much five hours ago. Terrible disappointment. I'm going to go drink it off at Bukowski's (where I can get a good beer for less than 5 f'in 25).
