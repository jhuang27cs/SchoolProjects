Auntie Ann's pretzels are the worst ever. I happen to go here last week.  The pretzel was greasy, stale, and terrible.  It is a stretch to call this food.  

Whereas a pretzel should be light and fluffy, this was greasy and almost fried-tasting, as though it had been sitting out too long.

Also, they won't give you mustard on it (well, they offered sweet mustard, whatever that is.  I wanted spicy brown mustard), so you have to use the packets of mustard, which are messy to apply.  

This was the worst pretzel I have ever had.  If you have a craving for a pretzel, you are better off looking for a food truck!
