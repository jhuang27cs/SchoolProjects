I've had two experiences at the Enormous Room- 

The first was on my 25th birthday, and yes, I was a little old for the crowd.  I had a fun enough time, dancing and getting really drunk but my (more sober) friends said it was totally lame with really weird guys trying to hit on us all night.

My second experience was on a Saturday night, and much more sober than the aforementioned birthday.  It was more low-key and I could see how it COULD be fun if you were with a big group and didn't want to meet people.  Otherwise- a total waste of time.  

In general, the bar is at the VERY back with little to no access, especially if it's crowded, and the bartenders were slow and apathetic.  I wouldn't go back.
