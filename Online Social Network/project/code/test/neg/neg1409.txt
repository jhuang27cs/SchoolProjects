Consider me unimpressed with HuHot. 

We waited a couple of months after opening to visit because of mixed reviews that seemed to be mostly related to staffing issues. But even with the intentional delay, my overall impression is that HuHot overcharges and under-delivers. 

We went to dinner with some extended family and while they were marginally more satisfied with the experience, the Mongolian-style cooking gimmick wasn't enough to get me past the underwhelming food presentation. 

Somewhere between the frozen meat chips and the chatty cook being completely oblivious to my food allergy notice, I realized that HuHot wasn't for me and wasn't worth the money. (Not to mention having to hunt down a server to refill my drink after 15+ minutes of waiting.) 

Maybe my problem is that I've been to really good stir fry joints (Flat Top Grill, anyone?) and HuHot, even in spite of its slick entryway decor, just doesn't measure up. 

Doubt I'll return.
