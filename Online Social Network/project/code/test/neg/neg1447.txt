He rushed me through the original appointment, there was no urgency in ordering an MRI, he encouraged me to ditch the crutches early to push my range of motion and he spouted his record of never having a patient with a blood clot. 10 days later (like I said, no rush) my MRI showed a worse condition than originally expected which could have seriously impaired my long-term ability to even WALK if I had continued to push my "pre-mature" rehab of walking or pushing my range of motion. After the MRI, my non-urgent impending surgery was expedited to within 2 weeks. During that time I sought a second opinion (which was a 45-minute appointment/consultation and he KNEW it was a 2nd opinion) and the doctor's thoroughness/time made him seek an ultrasound for fear of a blood clot. Sure enough, I had a blood clot which obviously complicated the surgery situation and was enough to make me switch doctors in order to protect my life! It is too bad I cannot do more to warn people from Dr. Eakin or take him to task for his over-confidence. There are MUCH better orthopedics...call SOAR and ask for Dr. Wall.
