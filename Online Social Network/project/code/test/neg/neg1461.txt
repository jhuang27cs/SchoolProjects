Came here for *years* for their lunch specials - so frequently the staff knew me by name. Prices CANNOT be beat... 

However, I came here once and there was a cockroach on the wall. I stopped coming for a long time but eventually, about a year later, gave into the temptation and decided to try again.

I got the broccoli beef to go. Upon opening it at home it appeared to be full of black pepper.  I looked closer and realized it was dozens of Weevils ... aka FLOUR BUGS.   Ick. 

I will never go back. If you go inspect your food. Closely.
