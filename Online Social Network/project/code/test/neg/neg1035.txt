I'm a huge fan of good carne asada fries and thought this could be the same Alberto's as a San Diego joint I went to a few weeks back. BUT ITS NOT. The meat was really dry and all the ingredients were sub-par. Maybe it was too late during the day whatever the case maybe I was an unhappy camper.. I could name 3 other Mexican Food spots in the immediate area that can give this place a run for their money.. BOOO.
