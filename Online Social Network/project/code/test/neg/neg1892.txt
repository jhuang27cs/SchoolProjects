I used to eat dim sum in New York's Chinatown and in heavily Chinese neighborhoods in Queens, NY, so I have pretty high expectations.  This place can't compare with my old haunts.  But based on the fairly positive reactions of my friends, who aren't as familiar with dim sum, this place is okay by Pittsburgh standards.

The dumpling wrappers on the vegetable dumplings were gummy, and popped right open when I picked the dumplings up.  The "rice crepes" were also a little too jelly-like in texture.  I don't recommend the cilantro crepe, even if you like cilantro.  The crispy crullers are a little better because the the crispness of the cruller contrasts with the gummy rice crepe wrapper, but you're better off just picking off the rice crepe and eating the cruller middle.  

My friends especially loved the Shanghai pork dumplings and sticky rice dumplings with chicken.  I couldn't eat those, but if you can, they might be your best bets.  

The egg custard tarts were decent, and a nice way to conclude the meal.  The tea, unfortunately, appears to come from tea bags and not loose tea leaves.  

Dim sum cart service is only on weekends.  What's more confusing is that only some items are brought around on the cart, while other items must be ordered.  I do miss seeing what all my food options look like before committing to anything.  The service here is pretty pleasant, though, which is a surprise when it comes to getting dim sum.
