I've been here twice, and I won't be returning.

The first visit was a rather wonderful date which I still remember fondly  -- it's their favorite restaurant and I guess I could see why:  it's convenient, the atmosphere is very warm and cozy, there's live music, the crowd and waitstaff are all young and fun -- but my Veal Saltimboca was terrible, burnt to a crisp and tougher than nails, overpriced at $23.95 -- I tried some of their crab & corn salad and meatballs & polenta, I suppose both dishes were fine fillers but in my opinion there was really nothing at all special or interesting about either of them.

The second visit -- remembrance of things past, in search of times lost -- I languished and luxuriated for about 3 hours... A bottle of pinot noir was well-priced, went down well... The steamed artichoke was mushy and entirely too oily... The grilled eggplant was undercooked and the marinara was way too salty... The orecchiette broccoli rabe with spicy sausage was fine, no complaints, but it was just okay... The house special lamb dish was overcooked and over-seasoned... I had a couple martinis (gin, of course) which were gratefully very potent.

My belabored conclusion: I want more, I deserve better.
