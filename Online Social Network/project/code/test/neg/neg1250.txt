Horrible service and bad customer relations.

My wife and I stopped in this afternoon to look at and potentially purchase 10 black  leather chairs for our new dining table which we had seen a few weeks previously in the store. We enquired about the chairs with the sales lady, who was strangely rude and abrupt even though the store was empty at the time, perhaps understandably so.

As they did not have the chair available in black, we asked if we could purchase  a white chair  to take home, to see if the chair would go well with our table, and if not return it before noon the next day for a credit and we would then potentially order the 10 chairs in black.
The sales lady emphatically informed us that f we did not bring the chair back by 7pm that evening , our credit card would be charged with no possibility of a credit card refund  if the chair did not go well with our table. She spoke with her manager over the phone who apparently agreed with her rationale. When we asked her to call the manager again so I could speak to him personally about my request, I was told he was in a meeting and could not be disturbed.

In these economic times, one would think retail stores would show some flexibility, and minimal "rule bending"  to engender customer relations and ultimately improve business. I purchased office counter stools from them some  years ago and was ready to do business with them  again.

 My wife and I  subsequently walked across the road to another store, Crate and Barrel, experienced outstanding service and found exactly what we were looking for and happily paid $100 mor per chair. 

I  would not recommend City Schemes and I will not do  business with them again.
