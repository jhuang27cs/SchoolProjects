Overrated, overrated, overrated. I first tried Wagamama in Oxford and even though I had tried it after being deprived of East Asian food for months, I hadn't been impressed. 

Sure, a bowl of noodles here is healthier than a package of instant ramen, but when you compare the prices ($9+ versus $0.95+), there's no contest. Also, the soup was bland and reminds me of weak shabu-shabu or hot pot broth. You can't beat Shin ramen for the flavor. Even the gyoza here can't compete with frozen dumplings from H-mart or Trader Joe's.
