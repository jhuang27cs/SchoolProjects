I attended a relatively diverse university in an urban area, and one of the things I loved about college was the proliferation of cheap but delicious restaurants of all cuisines catering to the broke student population.  I work near Ray's and gave it a try, hoping that its proximity to GA Tech meant that Ray's would deliver the same cheap+delicious formula.

I ordered the mediterranean sampler (to go - so I can't comment much on the ambience, although I can say it's definitely casual).  The sampler comes with hummus, baba ghanouj, tabbouleh, two pieces of falafel, several pita slices, and sides of tahini, pickles, banana pepper, and lemon wedge.  At $7.50, it's not a bad deal - it's definitely a LOT of food.  So Ray's gets a point for cheap(ish) food.

I'm sorry to say Ray's didn't fare as well on the delicious half of the formula.  The tabbouleh was actually pretty good - heavy on the parsley, which is how I like it.  The hummus and baba ghanouj were pretty standard - not bad, but nothing distinctive that you couldn't get in a grocery store.  The falafel were, well, weird - WAY too cinnamon-y.  And my other complaint was that the tahini was pure liquid - what are you supposed to do with that?  Anything you put it on it just drips off of.  I prefer tahini to be thicker, so you can actually scoop it with pita or falafel (but I have yet to find a place in Atlanta that makes tahini how I like it, so in all fairness I can't hold it against Ray's any more than any other place).

I might give Ray's 2.5 stars, but it doesn't meet my 3-star bar of a place I would come back to with no reservations.  For me, 2 stars means that I would go back but only under special circumstances (only place open, someone else really wants to go, etc.).  Given all of the other choices in this area, I don't think I'll be going back to Ray's any time soon.
