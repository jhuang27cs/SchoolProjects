Came here for the first time today and it kind of sucks. My friend and I were starving and needed some food fast but weren't feeling any of the countless fast food places on Fig. We decided to try Trio House. The food came fast, the service wasn't bad, but the food was not good. I had pad thai. The sauce tasted like it came from a box and the chicken pieces looked like they were more like a chicken's innards. It wasn't the worst food ever, but it definitely wasn't good. Next time, I'll just go to McDonalds.
