So happy now that I have found a new podiatrist. 
Several months back I went to Dr. Szpiro and wanted to turn around and run out of the office. I also refused to go back. I have been suffering since, but it's fine, I am on my way to recovery now. No amount of pain is worth going back. 

She is so rude, so unprofessional and insulted me about 7 times during my 20 minute appointment. Her recommendations for my issues were pretty much what I found on google. I think she has a very inflated sense of self-worth, and, I don't know why. I felt so uncomfortable there, and I left near tears. It's a huge shame too, because the location is prime, and the support staff in this practice are fantastic. They get 5 stars on their own.
