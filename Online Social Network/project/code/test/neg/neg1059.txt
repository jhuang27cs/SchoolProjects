So, I left the place feeling satisfied, having ate the falafel sandwhich (not the junior one- the full sized one) with delicious and healthy toppings. The service was pretty average, but quick, the tables were clean, the falafels were moist and not too dry like some falafels I have tasted. 

However, maybe five minutes after I left the place, walking toward my class, I started feeling stabbing pains in my stomach. I started to run towards my class, hoping to reach a bathroom inside the building, but it hurt so much I had to power walk to class. I honestly thought I was about to poo in my pants, it was that bad.  Than I sat in the bathroom for half an hour praying that I would get to my midterm review in time. Not gonna lie, there was diarreha, but after that uncomfortable experience my stomach didn't bother me. It was a short if very uncomfortable period of food poisioning.   

Still hungry?
