I've been to the Toast a few times. The food is plentiful and tasty, and leans heavily towards sweet-tooths. But, given the crazy lines, annoyingly loud music and god awful service, I don't think I will return.

How bad could the service be? Every single employee we interacted with was visibly annoyed at having to deal with customers. The hostess, who announced tables ready with a barely audible monotone, so that people waiting within 5 feet of her couldn't hear their own names and lost their tables, to our server, who couldn't manage to get our drink order without being asked 3 times, to the person at the front desk taking payments, whose back was turned away from the people trying to pay her, and preferred to face the wall.
