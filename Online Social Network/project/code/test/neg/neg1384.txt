While the prices are cheap, quality is sacrificed and the atmosphere is very unpleasing. Expect a very immigranty, bottom of the barrel sort of discount store ambience. Many of the shoes have a hooker/stripper feel to them, and are made of low quality synthetics. Would be better for something to wear once, in a pinch, or for a costume!
