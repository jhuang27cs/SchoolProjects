It pains me to give them a star! But I have no choice.

First and foremost, it should be completely OBVIOUS how horrible a place is if the staff thinks that it's okay to sit their patrons at a dirty, filthy table! It was horrible! There was tons of trash underneath the table! None of us saw it until after they had already taken our order. Also, it was a busy night and there weren't any other tables available and we were absolutely starving! And we sure as hell didn't want Burger King from down the street either. 

We ordered pho and ramen- safe dishes right? Wrong. The flavor was dull and just smelled horrible. We didn't finish our food but still paid. We certainly learned our lesson though- no more paying hard earned money for sub-par food. 

Came with Adam R. and Priscilla L. and we all made a pact to never let either one of us come here- no matter how hungry we are.
