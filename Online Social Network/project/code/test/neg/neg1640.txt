Never ever ever shop here. After having an employee tell me I had 14 days to return an item I went in the next day and they refused to give me credit or y money back. Also the employees are really rude and not that cool/or cute. I thought retail people were at least pretty?!?

The clothing is really over priced and if you look up the brands I assure you  they exist online for cheaper!
