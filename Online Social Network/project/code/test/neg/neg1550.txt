Its ok. The atmosphere is unique, very Bavarian. The service was quick and friendly. The food... ehh. I got the veggie burger, def not the "best veggie burgers in town". Both the burger and the fries were overdone. The burger was over charred and the fries were too crisp. The coleslaw was good. My husband said his sausage was good but not big enough to warrant the name "junk yard" Its probably a good place for a couple beers with friends but I don't think the food is worth a stop.
