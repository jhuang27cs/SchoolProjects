The Virginia peanuts were very meh, basically just boiled peanuts, mushy, lacks flavor.  The Grits were ok, probably highlight of evening, but he lamb app we got was just salty without much flavor.  The main entree was forgettable...gnocchi in some sort of salty brown sauce, very meh.  Overall a very forgettable dining experience.  Wait staff was excellent, quarters are a bit cramped but cozy.  probably won't go again, complete lack of flavor.
