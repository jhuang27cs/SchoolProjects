We did lunch. It had a nice quaint ambiance with rich dark woody colors.
Cafe Verde was a small cute cafe which offered a medium sized lunch menu with cleanly uniformed, friendly servers that were timely. 

I ordered a cup of tortilla soup which arrived in a torquoise colored lion head cup with tri-colored tortilla sliver chips and a creme fraiche swirl! The presentation was cute and alluring. The colors popped and made me wanna devour the soup. Unfortunately, the tortilla soup did not have the followthrough. It lacked salt and flavor and balance. Sadly, I've had better soups in corporate establishments and I was slightly disappointed. It tasted like watered corn tortilla blended into a tomato paste.=(   I also ordered a caprese salad: three mozzarella medallions, on a bed of baby arugula, tomatoes cut medium dice, and a balsalmic reduction. Asthetically, lacked presence- there were lots of arugula leaves that were turned  (yellow). The mozzarella was pre-sliced and frozen(meaning, they don't sell enough to have it fresh so they hold the cheese in the freezer).  The balsalmic dressing was the only highlight of the dish. 

Dear Chef Carlos can you ask the line cooks to at least defrost the rock hard cheese before it gets out to the patrons table? I almost asked my server for a machete and a Rambo du-rag to chop into my bufalata disk of steel. BTW....my dentist sends his thanks for the business!!!!
