The customer service rep was fairly rude to the customer ahead of me. The car was unclean and over scratched bumpers which were not obvious since the parking lot not illuminated. Also the car had a staunch smell. I tried to call in the customer service reps and got an attitude for not having caught it when I picked up the car. Next time I'll just cab it....
