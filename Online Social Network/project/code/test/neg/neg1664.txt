Why I like it:
-Open late
-Five minute walk from my house
-Service is friendly enough
-They have some placards in Arabic that remind me of home

Why I don't like it:
-Maybe my expectations of falafel / shawarma is a bit high, y'know, me being Lebanese and all, but the food here isn't that great for what it's supposed to be. I just feel that since the people who make these wraps are Egyptians, they should know better. All my friends love it, but it just doesn't taste like home to me.
