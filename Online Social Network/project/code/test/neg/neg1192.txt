I must say, this is one time I disagree with the all-powerful Oprah.
Sprinkles is totally a bomb.
It's not that I won't pay $3+ for a cupcake, I would  (see my review on Sibby's Cupcakery).  But I wouldn't even pay $2 for one from Sprinkles.  I must admit, I have not tried every flavor, and as a next morning breakfast on the go, their cupcakes suffice with a glass of milk; but if you're looking for a really good cupcake and you're wondering if it's worth it to buy one vs. get a 99 cent box of Duncan Hines cake mix and make it yourself - if your only retail option is Sprinkles, bake a dozen of them yourself, it'll be way more worth it.
Harsh, I know, but really, how many people do you need to tell you that they're dry?
