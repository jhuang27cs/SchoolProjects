The flavors are good but we weren't satisfied during/after our meal. 

I ordered the sizzling bibimbap, and the boyfriend ordered the bulgogi (marinated beef). My bibimbap was decent, it had a generous portion of vegetables and bulgogi on top of brown rice, and you get to drizzle however much gochujang (spicy red pepper sauce), and sesame oil as you prefer, and enjoy. Again, decent. The boyfriends order was literally just meat and rice, which, they charged extra for. He's not even Korean and he was itching for some kimchi! They don't serve any side dishes here, which makes for quite a lonely meal. Oh, they DID serve a tablespoon of potato salad as a side dish... I guess that counts?

Anyways, I definitely think that they can step it up and do well if they were a bit more generous with their food. Everything TASTES good, but I don't think I'd come back here unless I heard of improvements, simply because I know I wouldn't be satisfied with my meal. 

Decor: simple, clean, welcoming. The tables are all wood and aren't the most comfortable to sit on, but you won't do a lot of sitting because it doesn't take too long to eat the small portions they serve. The menu is quite nice to look at, because a) I love hand-written ANYTHINGS and b) the prices are, again, decent.
