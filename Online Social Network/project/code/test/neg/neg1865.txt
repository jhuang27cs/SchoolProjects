LOL.  I am writing a review for public because I bought lunch from Publix today.  $6.99 for a pound of wings.  This is just a warning.  If the wings look dry, it is because they are dry.  I order the spicy flavored wings previously and it was so dry that drowning it in Blue Cheese did not help at all.  I got smart this time.  I asked for the wings with the sticky BBQ sauce of it.  They were pretty  heavily breaded and drenched in BBQ, but at least they were not dry and hard as a rock.  Yummy.
