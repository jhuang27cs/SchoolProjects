so i took a friend here for dinner for a belated birthday dinner. it was one of the places that i had yelped as an option for dinner. they were really slow but then again its a wednesday night. they welcome you by drumming a few times. as all japanese places they were very friendly.

we ordered california rolls, salmon w/avocado rolls, salmon, a bento box with teriyaki beef & sashmi. the bento came with one miso soup and a bowl of rice with a slice of cantaloupe, mashed potato, and salad. 

service was great! sashmi not so much. tuna was the worst! i felt like it wasn't very fresh. i'm not an expert sashmi eater but it definitely didn't taste fresh.

it was a weeknight so there was plenty of street parking. they had  a picture of the staffs and adam sandler and another comedic actor that i can't recall of the name. i thought that that was pretty neat. i probably wouldn't go back though.
