I have only been to this establishment once, and I don't anticipate ever really going back...unless someone is treating as was the case during my first visit.

The food is billed as a traditional robata grill...which actually means nothing to me. The sushi was way below average as everything tasted like it might have been frozen at some point. There was just too much water inside the cuts of fish, with not a whole lot of flavor or texture.

The bar serves Johnny Walker Blue, however, at an obscene price. But again, if someone else is paying, I would order those all day (though blended scotch whiskey is not my thing). Honestly, running up the tab on someone elses dollar at this place is the only reason to go!!!
