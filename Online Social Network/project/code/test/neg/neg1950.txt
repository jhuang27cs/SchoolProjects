Im Filipino but avoid this place like the plague. I almost feel like ill get a stomach ache from eating the not-so-fresh food here. Both times I came to the place it was for a party and even then, the food wasnt great. The broth for the sinigang was bland, and no amount of patis would make it right. The other dishes on the buffet seemed sad and old. I can cook Filipino food well...but there are just days when I dont feel like cooking. I dont go to Gold Ribbon during those days ... ive been to Godo's in Fannin by the Med Center and it was WAY better than Gold Ribbon. The Filipino fast food place in the Viet Hoa food court is pretty good too.
