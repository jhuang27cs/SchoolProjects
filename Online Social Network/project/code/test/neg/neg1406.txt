Among the many sushi joints laced around the La Jolla area, this place is a bit overrated in terms as quality and pricing.  

I give them credit for the "rich appeal" but after making a trip to the rest room, I took a deep breath and the fish smell was very heavy.   A good sushi restaurant and someone who eats fish on a regular basis knows that fresh fish usually doesn't emit an odor.  It was pretty heavy once you get closer to the sushi bar.  

Parking is hotel style with a walk unless you choose the vallet which will drop you off right in the front.   

My friend and I sat at the bar, the waitress was nice, service was good but the food was very overpriced based on what we ordered.   

This place is good to check out but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
