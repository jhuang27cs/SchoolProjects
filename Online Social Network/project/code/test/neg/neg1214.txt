I went to Dr. Lucido once for a severe ear infection, and the very first thing he told me was that I needed for lose weight.  And how I could lose weight through diet and exercise.  Wow, I never thought of that, doctor!  And thanks so much for telling me how fat I am.  Because I had NO IDEA.

Now may I please have some antibiotics before my eardrum ruptures?
