I'd like to review this restaurant, but although the website says they are open until 11pm... they closed just after 9pm.  When I inquired I was told... it was slow,

Unlike Sovrana who WAS closed and offered to make me an eggplant parm - provided I picked it up from the side door!  THAT's service!!!
