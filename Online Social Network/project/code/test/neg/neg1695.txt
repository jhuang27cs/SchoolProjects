Wow is this place gross.

I enjoy electronic music and all (though I prefer old school pop-based stuff over anything even remotely related to house/trance/drum&bass etc.) but even for an electronic music lover this place is awful.

Gross dudes and girls grinding everywhere.  The floor sticky with year-old spilled drinks...

The smell...   God the smell!

Never setting foot in this place again.
