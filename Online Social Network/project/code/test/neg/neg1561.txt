I have used this shop several times. It seems like they change attitude depending on how much you are willing to spend. I especially had a bad experience a few days ago. I don't think I'll ever go back to the place.
Oh, no. I asked twice if I could get wrapping/ribbon. First, I was told no. Then the second time I asked if I could get a ribbon if I paid and you said yes! Someone gave me the tiniest ribbon for 2 dollars and I asked if I was paying 2 dollars for that, then you told another lady to give me a bigger one. I don't think I "insisted" so much. In one of the messages we exchanged earlier, you also said I would have been "mad" anyway. I was not mad but just disappointed.
