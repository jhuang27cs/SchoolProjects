In theory, Olive May's should be Princeton's definitive source for organic produce and natural foods.  It's within walking distance of campus, the prices are lower than those of comparable local competitors, and its large facilities allow for a truly solid selection of products.  Accessibility, price, and variety--everything you need in a market, right? 

Unfortunately, after a few visits, the initial charm started to wear off.  Slowly I realized that most of canned and packaged food is also available at cheaper markets (like down the road at McCaffrey's), a good deal of the extensive selection of beauty products are rather low-quality, and certain aspects of the store are not kept to the highest of professional standards.  At my last visit, the vast majority of the granola/cereal/dried fruit dispensers were almost completely empty, and the veggie section was also pretty picked-over. 

By and large, Olive May's is clean, friendly, and prices its groceries fairly, and these qualities will almost certainly keep me coming back every once in awhile.  Nobody's perfect, and Olive May's has potential.
