MGCI is one of those places where only nostalgia can save the experience. Sadly, my nostalgia is ancillary to my husband's memories of gyros at 3 a.m. used only for the specific reason of absorbing alcohol.

Lots of alcohol.

The floors are sticky, the bathroom toilets are clogged, the food gives you lassitude. As an adult, there is nothing redeeming about the experience. Walking through a kitchen to drop trow usually gives me the heebies anyway, but this was Dead (Wo)Man Walking reincarnate. 

Just ew. Plain and simple. And $14 for a hani and some fries? Don't insult me, MGCI.
