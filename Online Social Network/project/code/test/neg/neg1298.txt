This place is in the basement of Ben Taub Hospital, right on the other side of the wall from the imaging lab so there is a huge electrical field which will mess with your cel phone or other electronic device. Its disorganized, crap food & service. 

Unfortunately, if you're at the hospital for any kind of service or in my case an all day affair for a family member's cancer treatment, then you don't really have any options for food as the cafeteria doesn't have consistent or even decent/affordable food options.

I can't see how a hospital can justify having a fast food establishment onsite as its definitely not a healthy option for its patients or its staff.
