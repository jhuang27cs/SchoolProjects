I just have a few things to add.  Granted, we stopped in before a sold out show at the Fox (Mumford and Son- awesome), but Baraonda bills themselves as a place to go before or after a show at the Fox.  And  they weren't even slammed.
  We were offered immediate seating on the patio then promptly ignored.  Eventually we wound up with warm beer and cold pizza- both resulting from an inattentive server not getting the product to the table.   The pizza came before the salad  which they took off the check.  Nobody seemed concerned as to whether we would have enjoyed a second beer (except us) until we had finished eating, with empty glasses. The pizza's had a nice char on the outer rim but was soggy in the middle by the time we got it. Possibly the crust was a bit undercooked.  They must rely on the fact that people who stop in before a show are reluctant to send a dish back due to time constraints.  

We sat under a speaker which was blasting a techno loop that appeared to have no beginning nor end but lots of thump.  Annoying.

On the positive side, the spicy salami slices on the  Fra Divolo are really good.   And the guy who fills the water glasses did a great job!
