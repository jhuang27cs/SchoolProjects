Salt Creek sets itself as a fine dine date night restaurant. I loved the decor and the bar, however a look at the Menu I was a tad disappointed. There isnt much variety to look at is what I felt.

I ordered a couple of drinks, personally didnt like the Salt Creek special martini.

The mushroom based appetizer was average and so was the main course. The next time I go here will probably be only for known drinks. 

I do give the ambiance and service five stars.
