I don't get the love for this place. I've been here a ton of times because of friends loving Toscanini's, and I've even tried their weekend brunch items, but I am just not that impressed. I have never tried a flavor that seemed better than "just okay." It's a fine establishment, but a lot of people tell me this is the "best in Boston," and I don't think it deserves such high praise. 

I rolled my eyes on the bus as some guy told his friends from out-of-town that this was the most famous ice cream place in Boston because it was the best thing ever. The bus rolled by Toscanini's, and I could see the sad faces of three women reflected back at me as they stared longingly at what they believed to be the greatest ice cream purveyor ever.

Who does their PR anyways? That's the real genius of this place.
