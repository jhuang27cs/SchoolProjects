The food was ok-ish...but pretty bland for my taste. But as my party and I were leaving, a cockroach fell from the ceiling and into our basket of chips. THANK GOODNESS it happened on our way out. Though it later dawned on me, if that's what's happening where everyone can see....what's happening in the kitchen?

There are so many other places to go for much better Tex-Mex, I don't see any reason to stop here.
