I don't want to risk my life flying with someone who stinks like pot.  I know marijuana is legal now for some people but seriously, would you want to jump off a cliff dangling from a parachute steered by someone who is stoned?  The pilots aren't the only thing high, the prices are way too expensive.  $150 for 15 minutes?  I can go to a flight school and fly a real airplane with a licensed pilot for a whole hour for less than that.
