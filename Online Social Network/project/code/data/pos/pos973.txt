It should be illegal to sell something so addictive. Once you have had their coffee you can't go back to anyone else!

I recommend the Mocha Tesora if you like a flavorful nutty dark roasted coffee. I really like that you get to choose the sweetness of your drink; if you're a newbie start low in the sweetness department--they can always easily add more but not subtract.

Yes one cup will cost you around $4 but it had me completely wired the entire day! You won't need another cup of coffee. So the next time you think you're going to be stuck in lab for a 14 hour experiment, skip the cafes on campus and come down here. It'd be super nice if Philz join the Stanford student/staff discount program (wishful thinking ;D) but they don't need it to attract business.
