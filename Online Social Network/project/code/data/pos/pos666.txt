The Daily (UW's paper) goes here for group dinners ever since they've moved into Northcut Landing near UVillage, and this place is great!

Food: Pretty good pizza. I got the prosciutto & arugula pizza, and it was a bit dry. My friend, however, got the Bianca (the special for the night) and boy it was DELICIOUS. My salad (chicken, mixed greens, etc...) was quite tasty, but my friend's caprese was amazing! Finally, we were served tiramisu and gelato on the house and that was fantastic. 

Service: Our waitress was great. Coincidentally her boyfriend worked at The Daily, but even if he didn't I'm sure she would've been just as great. Our food arrived promptly, our glasses were always filled, and she kept those lemons coming! 

Price: Not bad, especially for the size of the single salad. The pizza is a bit bigger than a personal pizza, so the $12 price is not really high.

Ambiance: A bit noisy and busy, so not really a "date" place. Great for kids and family and group dinners though!

We love this place, so I'm sure we'll be back again!
