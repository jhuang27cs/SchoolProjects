I'm not a Bostonian from birth.  I grew up out west where it's not cool to be a geek or get your nerd on.  Where I come from comic book stores are usually reserved for back alleys next to check cashing places and pawn shops.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered Newberry comics.  People walking around the city with bags of a freaky looking kid on them proclaiming that these people had bought comics, glorious glorious comics.

But alas, when I first entered into a Newberry, I was dismayed with all the other crap that was there.  Stuff that was great if I were to shop at Hot Topic of a Spencers gifts.  But comic book stores are reserved for comic books, with the occasional action figure thrown in just to balance things out.  It wasn't until I discovered Million Year picnic that I found my north easter oasis.  It's everything I believe a comic book shop should be.  A place with more comics then they have space for, and a staff that's probably read everything there, twice.  If you want something they don't currently have, they can find it for you and get it in.  There hasn't been a time where I went in there and didn't walk out with something, and more often then I'd care to admit, I've even walked out with a smaller bank account then I'd come in with, but extra goodies I'd found without even looking.

If I had to pick something to complain about, and let's face it, I'll never be elite if I only said good things about places.  I'd say this, check out sometimes takes a bit of time.  They check off each purchase of the trade paperbacks, and their credit/debit card machine is slow, when it's working at all.  I've been there on two separate occasions where the machine was down and it took a painful amount of time to get home and read my new purchases.

(Who am I kidding?  We all know I'll have read everything on the bus ride home)
