I have been here many times, and every time the food and service have been amazing. My favorite dish is only about 7$ for a huge bowl of noodle soup. I am also very partial to the fresh rolls as an appetizer. 

The location is not super convenient for parking, however, once you are at Le's, there is a Ben and Jerry's and a Starbucks in the same building so, dessert and after dinner coffee are all in the same place. So you see, it is well worth the schlep.  

It is generally best to make a reservation here because it does get fairly busy at night, but if you do have to wait, there are nice tables to sit at right in front of the restaurant, with some prime people watching possibilities.
