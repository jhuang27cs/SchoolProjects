I was torn between giving this particular Urban 3 or 4 stars. I think it deserves 3 for the selection, even though it's a two story store. They never have a decent selection of shoes (aside from ballet flats) and pretty much no home items. However! I do have to give them 4 stars because the staff is just wonderful. I do most of my Urban shopping online, but because their brands are each sized so differently (and, unfortunately, many things just don't look right on my body type), I end up returning or exchanging a lot of things to this store. They are always so nice and helpful. If I want to exchange an item for a different size and they don't have it (often the case since, as I said, selection isn't great) they call another store and have it mailed to my house, without charging for shipping! This is my favorite thing about shopping here, it's amazing how few stores will do this for you.
