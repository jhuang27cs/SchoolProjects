Went here after a choral performance...so did the other choristers!  It's DARK inside, but it adds to the ambiance.  Food was tasty pub grub (and they do use Calder Dairy Sour Cream...is it wrong that I want to eat that with a spoon?) but a little pricey.  I can see why people make this their "backup" spot...
