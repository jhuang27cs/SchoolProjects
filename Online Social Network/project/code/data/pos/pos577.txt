Yes it's a bit overpriced for things, yes the setup is a bit confusing as a newb. That being said it is huge portions of tasty, fresh and real food. They make it to order and it comes out hot when it needs to be. I am willing to pay more for that myself.

I have had breakfast and lunch here now. I brought my dad for the breakfast trip. We debated the menu and finally settled on splitting a farmer's omelette with ham, potatoes, onions, green pep, swiss and cheddar. We also went halfsies on the cheese blintzes with strawberries and pineapple. Everything we ate was happy. It was more than enough for us and we enjoyed every bite. 

For lunch I brought my mom. I sampled a lemon chicken salad with a muffin. Mmmm a happy salad indeed. Marinated chicken breast served hot over mixed greens with red onions and alfalfa sprouts. It's served with with tomato wedges, strawberries and oranges and topped with pecans. I ate every bit. My mom had a chicken salad and fruit plate with strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, fresh pineapple, bananas, apple wedges and orange wedges. It was garnished with frozen yogurt. Impressive and it made her extremely happy.Everything was ripe and tasty.

I will bring James here sometime when he can wait. I hear weekends can be a zoo.
