This is one of LA's under appreciated museums. Everyone should come here at least once. Right now they have an exhibit called Sonic Scenery. This is an amazing exhibit, they asked different artist form the LA area of compose pieces based on the different display galleries. You can either download the music for free to your ipod or rent a headset at the museum for three dollars. This lets you experience the exhibits in a whole different way.
See it before it closes!
