Last night was my first time at beleza. I had heard mixed reviews...Well I have to say if you dont like this place maybe you dont really get it. This is the first place in Atlanta to do the cocktail louge thing right. The drinks are exceptional. I had a drink called "Envy". It was an absinthe drink with honey, egg whites, and basil...sounds strange...soooo good!! I was nervous about the eggs, but the bartender told me "shake em hard and youre just making meringue". He was increadably knowledgeable, definatley a cocktail nerd. Not the place to order a vodka-tonic, you will definatley get a sideways glace, and with good reason,-thats like ordering a cheese sandwich at the Ritz dining room.Aside from the great cocktails they have a DJ everynight and good nibbles on the menu. Ill definatley be back.
