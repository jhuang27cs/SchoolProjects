Just like the Trader Joe's back home. 

The store is clean, and people are friendly. 

I agree with others, the price is pretty reasonable for what they sell. I always love going to their frozen food section because they have pretty interesting and exotic combination of frozen food. Their desserts are also really amazing!

I'm glad there's one in Claremont... I miss TJ!!!
