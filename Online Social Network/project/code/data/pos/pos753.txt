The beef pad see-ew here was the first I ever tried and it got me hooked! It's the default thing for me to order now every time I go to a Thai restaurant. The pad thai is also pretty good. 

I've gotten some really great servers with a lot of personality in the past. Some other servers are just nice, but don't talk too much.

One observation: When you order food to go, the portions are pretty reduced. One time though, I asked for my pad see-ew to be packed in a vertical container of some sort because I was riding a bike home (and didn't want to dump the regular flat to-go container in my backpack), and to my surprise, the portion seemed bigger as it was packed in a taller soup container.
