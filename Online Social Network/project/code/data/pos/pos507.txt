Both of the Pearl Paint stores I've frequented (this location and Philadelphia's) just fill me with ecstasy. I am thoroughly addicted to paints and brushes and I could spend ALL BLOODY DAY in this store. The sales are great, the student discount is sweet (though I've just graduated...wonder if they'll notice my ID is expired?), and I dunno about the complaints about the staff...every last one has been incredibly nice to me. I was up in the paint department and I must have asked the gal a thousand questions. She had infinite patience and was also really friendly and conversational. They stock just about everything I need, and honestly, as someone who buys primarily paints (oil and acrylic) and brushes, with occasional pastel and colored pencil purchases, I have never had a problem finding things. When I do, the staff are right there, ready and willing to help. It's pricey, but heck, that's art supplies for you! I can't really make a single complaint, especially after seeing the far less organized, by comparison rather poorly stocked art store across the street.
