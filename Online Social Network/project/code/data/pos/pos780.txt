Came here for brunch, and while there was a 40-minute wait, it was so worth it. Their amazing bloody marys helped keep me company as my friends waited to be seated. Once seated, we were treated to a slightly wacky ambiance, and served by hipsters. I ordered the incredibly delicious smoked salmon benedict and a side of sweet potato fries to die for. This is a real gem.
