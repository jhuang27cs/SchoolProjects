This is a jewel of an art museum, with an incredibly broad collection for a museum of this size. They have everything from ancient Egyptian to Japanese prints to video. They have an entire building dedicated to decorative arts of the Colonial period.
Their special exhibitions are always interesting. I particularly like the faculty art shows -- so fun to see new stuff and what a great range of talent.
This is one of the best places in Providence.
The museum is often free for special RISD events.
