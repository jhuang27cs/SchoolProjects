Fantastic service! I'm getting IPL treatments from a Groupon. The service has been thorough, timely and successful.  I've had IPL previously so I don't have much hyperpigmentation left to take off but the IPL really helps with my pores and skin tone in general. There is no down time after each procedure. Would highly recommend to anyone!
