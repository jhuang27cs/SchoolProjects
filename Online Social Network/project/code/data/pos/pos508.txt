I've only been to two tapas places in my life so I may not be the best judge of good tapas restaurants, but I do like this place. I have never been on a Friday or Saturday, but I imagine they get extremely busy considering the area. 

Prices are reasonable, food is great, the entertainment is a nice touch. Only issue is it can get loud at times and parking kinda sucks. 

I'd definitely recommend though.
