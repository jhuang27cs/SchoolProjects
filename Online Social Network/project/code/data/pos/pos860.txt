It's a beautiful Spring morning, and I am at work. Am I working? Nah, that's for the birds. Instead I am gobbling  down a chicken and egg biscuit from Sunrise  while typing my Yelp review  regarding my breakfast .

The biscuit is huge!  It's light and fluffy with a buttery taste.  The chicken is a full chicken breast with a crispy, breaded exterior. The egg is a real egg, not egg substitute.  I also ordered hash browns with my biscuit and it was your typical grease fest, but still good.  

I have heard the line of cars can get quite long on a weekend morning, but the wait time was minimal when I went during the week.  

Sunrise biscuits is a small hidden little gem that should be frequented by biscuit lovers everywhere!
