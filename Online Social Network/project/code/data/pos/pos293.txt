I'm struggling before 3 and 4 stars, I hate to be this mean. its a 3.5 (grossly approximated to 4) stars.

The thing is, with the Silver Skillet, you are eating there to get a piece of history, a landmark, a feeling or being back in an old school diner. I doubt that you come here for exceptional food.

Grated, their pork chops are really good.. but its the best thing on their menu. To be brutally honest, the pork chops are super tasty, and their biscuits are probably the best ive had in a long time. However, the portions aren't that big, the prices are a little high, and the rest of their items (eggs, hash browns, etc) are just OK. Edible, tasty, satisfying, not food orgasm. I am super picky about my soft poached eggs to be fully runny on the inside. The were already mostly cooked on the inside. :(

I still really liked coming here. They have the super old school trivial pursuit and play awesome hits from 1969 and before. The waiters are very nice and the whole feel of the place is really cozy and nice. You definitely do feel like you are part of the landmark, making this place a "must visit" for the environment more than anything.

The good: I ate enough to make me pass out for 2 hours after eating here. I wasn't hungry until 7pm.
The bad: the tables were a tad sticky and they charged me an extra $1 to replace the white gravy and potatoes for hash browns. $10.75 was a tad steep. (deal with it, i'm a cheapo).

Would come again with out-of- towners to show them the place.
