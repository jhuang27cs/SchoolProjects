This spot is great reminds me of other coffee shops in (Tryst) DC, and NY.. Always felt a good vibe of this spot.. As a coffee shop it does more than required.. (Location,Coffee, Food/Lunch, Liquor, Free WiFi,  and a really cool staff).. As a bar/ lounge. 4****. 

  I DJ'd at Octane for there 5 year anniversary,  as well as a few other events and killed it. The crowd was 'going in"..(Slang: having extreme fun) lol.. They started on a great note and only moved up the ladder.. Whenever in ATL. This is one of my fav spot.
