So glad we stopped in to Splash Cafe as the food was super delicious and inexpensive! Ironically enough we came here a few days after visiting Boston and can honestly say that Splash's chowdah is every bit as good as Boston chowdah! I also added the extra crab and shrimp topping on to my chowder for only $1 more and it was quite an extra heaping of seafood. The bread bowl it was served in was warm and crispy and they also toasted the piece of the bread they take out to make room for the soup. The host and waitress were extremely friendly and the establishment was clean. I highly recommend for super satisfying meal and experience!
