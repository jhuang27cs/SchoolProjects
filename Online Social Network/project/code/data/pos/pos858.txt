A new, quaint little stop in Oakland.

I stopped here with a friend the other day for some dinner. The decor is kind of bland, but the prices are reasonable. There's a plethora of food to choose from, from burgers and fries, to Peruvian fried rice, which is what I ordered. 

The food was great. The chicken is seasoned beautifully, and the portion was GENEROUS. The staff is friendly and was willing to help us out when we needed it.

My only complaint: there was no ice in the ice machine, so one of the staffers went outside and came back with ice in a tiny bucket. Kind of sketch, but, oh well, I got ice.

I suggest you check this place out. Pretty yummy stuff.
