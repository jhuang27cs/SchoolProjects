I've always been a fan of Korean food and have walked past this spot numerous times.  This place is always packed and usually has a wait during dinner.  I've been meaning to try this spot for a while and finally got the opportunity during a Friday dinner.  There was only 2 of us so our wait ended up being no more than 10 mins.
Everything was delicious and food came out quick.  Ordered the short ribs and the tofu soup and finished everything! I'll be back soon and will bring new folks to experience this great place.
