Okay heres the deal when you aint got money like most college kids you go to establishments like this who caters to folks like you. Back through my college years, the gf went to school at UCLA so as broke as I was I always managed to scrounge up a little something something here to buy us an ice cream sandwich I mean for a buck you cant beat that. The cookies are freshly made and the ice cream is dreyers so for the money you can't beat that. They also serve hot dogs for those that are hungry.
