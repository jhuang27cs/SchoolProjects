4 paws for this oriental delight.
It wasnt an upscale place but still tasty. The curry I had wasnt as spicy as I wouldve liked, but nothing some siracha sauce couldnt fix!
It was meaty and with lots of vegies.
I went with my friend who had the pork friend rice (I secretly wanted to try it)
It looked and smelled good. Very nicely sized portion too.
If im ever in that area I would definitely try it again.
