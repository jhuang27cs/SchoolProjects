This is one of those great little things about Ann Arbor.  It's basically a head shop.  You know, a place where you can buy "tobbaco" pipes.  I bought my first "tobbaco" pipe from Stairway to Heaven.  Haha, get it, because selling products of or pertaining to marijuana would be illegal.  The act of simply allowing some poor 18-year-old kid to purchase a bong with his or her hard earned lawn-mowing money would cause them to fall deeply into the bottomless pit of despair that is marijuana addiction.  But hell, promoting smoking pipe tobbaco straight out of a one-hit is alright.  Stupid American draconian drug-laws.

This store also contains left-wing propaganda ranging from hilarious anti-Bush parodies to disturbing tinfoil-hat conspiracy newsletters.
