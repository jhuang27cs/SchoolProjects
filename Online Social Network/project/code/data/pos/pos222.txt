Were it not for the Bent Spoon, many a Princeton graduate student might have shriveled up and died in their lab basements and cubicles. It's one of those saving graces of the local Princeton town (that number can be counted on one hand) and can motivate one to push through a day of work.

I personally buy a scoop so I can taste the variety of flavors first. Some memorable ones: Earl grey tea-- it's novel to have the taste of tea in a cold, non-liquified texture. Honeydew-- smoother than eating melon itself. Sorbets of all sorts, especially their blood orange-- sweet and tangy and cooling. Pistachio-- it's so potently pistachioey, it's more like the essence of pistachio, as if you took that filmic skin of pistachio, compressed it, and turned it into ice cream.

It's a  fun game to walk into the store and guess what flavors they'll have for the day. Even more fun is getting a free scoop after you've finished off your punch card!
