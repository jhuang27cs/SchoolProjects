I finally made it out to this place.  I've been wanting to compare it to Espetus in the city.

(Note, before I continue: DO NOT starve yourself thinking you can take in more food! Bad call on my part because (1) my stomach shrank and I was stuffed after the damn salad bar (2) you'll just be throwing away your $$$ if you don't try a small piece of everything (3) just come prepared to eat a lot of meat)

I actually like the ambiance and the set-up more at Pampas.  Great lay-out (tri-level), spacious, can accommodate large parties, service was good, attentive to your needs (you can "pre-order" the meats you want them to come around with), good vibe all around.  They also have a good cocktail menu.

Espetus does have a better salad bar (more selection) and better desserts though.  

Totally recommend this place, but save it for a special occasion because it's on the pricey side ($44/person for the unlimted option - which isn't THAT bad for all-you-can-eat)... That doesn't include your drinks.  I ended up paying $61 with ONE cocktail, so it can add up fast if you're a drinker.
