This was my first time going to Princeton Nails. I just walked-in for an acrylic fillin. They were price competitive, used really good product (OPI acrylic vs the regular stuff), and were among the most polite I have come across in the area. She also did a phenomenal job; the shape and length were exactly what I wanted, and she did an impeccable job with the painting. After they were dried, she even put my coat on for me! A+ service and I intend on going again. Thanks Annie!
