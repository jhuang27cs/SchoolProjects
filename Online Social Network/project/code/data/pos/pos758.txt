Some of my Berkeley sisters took us here after a meeting. Normally I am not a big fan of Thai food, but I really liked this restaurant.

A couple of our girls went to the restaurant early to save spots for us. One thing I liked was how the waitress had everything set up- silverware, waters, and extra water.

When the waitress took my order (usually I am super indecisive) I asked her if she had a recommendation for the meat to put in my order-
I ordered number 44- and she quickly responded, "chicken,"  instead of asking me a whole bunch of questions before making a recommendation- which I liked. 

#44 had a good flavor with a kick to it (the chili). The flavors were yummy- not too over powering or too little. The portions were generous for a THai restaurant- I was expecting half of what I got.

When it came time to pay- I liked how you just go up to the waitress and tell them what you ordered and pay there- that way you dont have to calculate what you ordered and how much you need to pay towards the group bill. 

The one thing I didn't like, was how I think either they need to up date the prices, or let the customers know if they are paying with card and their amount is less than $10- they added the tip in. 

The prices said the noodles were suppose to be 6.99- with tax this would have been around 7.70-8.00 for the meal. When she told me my meal was $9 ( I think it was cuz she saw I was going to pay with a card?), I didnt think too much about it, but when I got home, I would have preferred her letting me know there is a 10 minimum- that way I would have tipped her the amount that adds up to 10 (if it would have been less than 15-20% I would have just given her 15-20% tip instead)



Overall I would come here again
