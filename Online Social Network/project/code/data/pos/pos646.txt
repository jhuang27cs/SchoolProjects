Summary:  High-quality sandwiches.  Friendlier than the in-law who wants to borrow $1000 for his new start-up.

Jimmy John's is a franchise but they make a superior quality sandwich.  You have a choice of regular bread or french roll, and the ingredients are top-notch and come with super-fresh toppings.  They are incredibly fast--a lot of times I'll order the sandwich, pay, and by the time I've picked out the chips they have it ready.  This is the place to go if you are on a time limit at lunch.  Plus they are super friendly--you get a choir of welcomes the moment you step in the door.  The box lunch is an excellent value if you are catering a lunch.  I work in the Med Center and use them regularly for meetings.
