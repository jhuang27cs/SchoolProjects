Went to Grendel's Den for the first time this weekend and was pleasantly surprised!  Have been to Harvard Square a million time s and some how never checked out Grendel's.  All food was half price if you buy a drink.  In season they offer warm cider drinks.. can't wait to go back and try em.  Cute and cozy inside with a fireplace (wasn't lit while we were there).  Staff was friendly but not over the top.  I would reccomed this place after a day of shopping or for a snack and a drink if you are looking to relax.
