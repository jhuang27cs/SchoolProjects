have been waiting for this place to open for quite awhile and was pleasantly surprised.  they have an awesome drink and creative food menu.  we ordered the 10 course tasting menu for $45 and felt it was well worth the money.   at the 5th course i was already full!! and took the rest home.    our waitress was very nice and helpful.  Great addition to central square!!
