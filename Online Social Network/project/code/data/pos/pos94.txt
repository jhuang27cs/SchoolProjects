When I bring my friends come from college; I always take them to Chuck's. It's just a given. I honestly have never gotten anything besides wings here. They are always given in huge portions and the prices are okay. It is worth it though. If you don't like college kids--don't come here. It is always packed with them. It is in walking distance to everything awesome and if you are lame and drive in Princeton--then there are parking spaces available near by.
