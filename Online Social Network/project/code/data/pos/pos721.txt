The best Mexican in NYC hands down.

I love this place. It's a hole in the wall--just a few tables inside and the grill is up front. You can watch them make your food. The food is cheap but really good and you get a LOT of it!

I am vegan so I usually stick to bean, veggie, or cactus taco--they are sooo huge and really good. Their rice is the bomb-sticky and soft. I always leave this place with leftovers and totally stuffed!
