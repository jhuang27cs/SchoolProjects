Tanino is a restaurant which really understands its customer base, in  addition to preparing food. This is, yet, another relative of Celestino Drago, Giacamino and heaven knows how many other Drago brothers. Those guys really understand what folks want to eat and what they want to spend. Good for them! 
The restaurant is just gorgeous!! What a pleasure to walk in to this exquisite setting. The service is always fine. One can always count on ingredients being fresh and top quality. Perhaps, Mama or Papa Drago taught the sons the art of fine pasta making. The lessons were followed well. Pasta, especially the ravioli is always beautiful. Not an ounce of pretension.
