My best Tex-Mex friend wanted to go to Border Cafe for her birthday with a few of our friends.  To me that says something about the food right there.  Let's face it - any of us who have spent time in the south are on a constant mission to find even remotely comparable food on the east coast (mission may never really be accomplished).

But on the whole, Border Cafe does a nice job!  While Mexican food generally is just the same 6 ingredients combined in different ways, they have found a way to have an interesting selection of dishes and still include everyone's favorites.  Don't fill up on the starter baskets of tortillas - it's a cheap trick!  But have some if you're gonna drink - I've never had a margarita here that wasn't overfilled with tequila, and I don't care if its good tequila or not, cuz I'm feeling it, it tastes good, and its not breaking my paycheck.  It's best in the summer when some of the college crowd is away and there's slightly more room to move around...but generally the place is busy so get there early if possible!  They won't seat you until your whole party is there so get your cool late-shower friends to get themselves together!
