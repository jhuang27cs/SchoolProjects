While driving through NJ my dad wanted to stop at one of the many memories he had from college.  Staying up late studing and dropping by here in the late hours of the night to grab one of the best hoagie's ever.  

These things are what my dad would say "exquisite".  The bread is awesome and the amount of food you get for the low price is fantastic.  I love how they have pictures hanging on the wall next to the register of people wearing their Hoagie Haven T-Shirts from all over the world.  It made me want to buy one, and I did.  So now I have this awesome orange Hoagie Haven shirt that is the colors of the school it represents, Princeton.  

I ordered the Pizza Steak Hoagie because it was my dads favorite and my sister got the meatball one.  I am not a fan of meatball sandwitches, but when I tried hers, it was really really really great.  I absolutely loved mine, I ate half of a whole one with my dad and I kept thinking I wanted more, but when I got up to go order another, the line was out the door and we needed to get back on the road.  

This place has a spot in my dads heart and I have to say this place is so good it is now apart of me too.  Maybe it runs in the blood, but I have to say I can not wait to come back here.  Maybe I should try and get accepted to Princeton? haha in my dreams.....
