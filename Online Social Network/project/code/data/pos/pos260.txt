This is an excellent floral shop, in downtown and just a block from main campus.  They have a wide variety of flowers, from birds of paradise to hybrid roses.  They will wrap your arrangement beautifully for you to give as a gift.  They also have delivery services, which is very convenient and efficient.  The staff is wonderful in helping to choose an arrangement for the occasion.
