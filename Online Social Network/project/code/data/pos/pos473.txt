Okay, so it isn't really "California" style. I lived there for several years, so I should know. However, I have had lots of Mexican food and it served its purpose. I was shocked at how limited Ann Arborites are in Mexican choices. I thought the food was delicious. The chicken was white meat chicken breasts and unlike many mexican places I've been to, food wasn't shlepped all over my plate into one big runny mess. The owners are not Mexican, but it doesn't matter. They do a FAR better job than those clowns over at Tios. I enjoyed my food there very much, their prices are reasonable and they make a delicious Strawberry Daquiri that tastes like strawberry, unlike Tios who served me up lemon sour mix disguised as a Strawberry Daquiri. Loved the chimichanga and chicken tacos...they don't charge you for chips and the chips taste good, not like they were mass produced (ie. the yellow gross ones from tios), they smother your food with cheese and don't charge extra for it, ie. Tios, and the service was great, ie. unlike Tios. The salsa is tasty and the food tasted fresh. There were actually tomatoes and lettuce on my plate, unlike tios. I give this place thumbs up. Anyone bad mouthing it has got to be from evil tios. One big plus and something to look for in a restauraunt: cilantro. If they use it in their sauce, then they are at least aiming at authentic..
