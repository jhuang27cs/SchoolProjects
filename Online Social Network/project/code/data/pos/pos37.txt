I went here today after not having been here in years (due to a bad first few visits, but I heard that its under new management so I decided to give it a try).  

Overall, there are very few T-accessible knitting stores, and this is one of the better ones.  The staff were helpful but not hovering and the guy who rang me up gave me some good tips about the sock flats I was buying.  Yes, the selection is small, but its also about 200 feet from the Red Line train.  Also, they had a good selection of prices, from gorgeous expensive stuff to plenty of options in the $7-$10/skein range.  Yay!  My graduate-student-budget thanks you, Woolcott!
