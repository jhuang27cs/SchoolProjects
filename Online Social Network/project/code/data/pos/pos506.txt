My first time at the MIT Museum  was at the Yelp Modulations party.

I want to go back and bring my geeked-out friends along. The downstairs is interesting, but the real goodies are available on the second floor. The first floor highlight, pour moi, was checking out the strange toys and inventions ("Claude Shannon's Ingenious Machines") which were alternately delightfully creepy and sweetly precious.

Upstairs, as many have mentioned, were buttloads of robots. Reading the placards next to many of their cases, I was amazed at how many were developed by MIT students at such a young age. It's amazing to think that your senior thesis project might go on to become a viable piece of medical technology that actually helps people, but I digress....

The holograms on display are awesome. My favorite were the "moving" holograms, in which a lady will blow you a kiss and one which shows a red line train eternally pulling into the Charles MGH T-stop sometime in the early 80's. It's pretty freaky to look at  representations of people, like artist Keith Haring, and know that they are now dead, yet have them look so real and so touchable in front of you.

The absolute best part of the museum was the gallery with Arthur Gascon's "Gestural Engineering" : utilitarian, machine-based artwork. I loved the 11 flying pieces of paper that flapped their wings like birds and the violin  whose strings were gently stroked by a feather. It was gorgeous, and better than anything I've seen recently at the ICA.

Finally the "Mind and Hand: The Making of MIT Scientists and Engineers" exhibit, featuring academic paraphernalia such as textbooks, school supplies, uniforms and ephemera like dance cards, laundry receipts, and movie tickets dating from 1860 to the present was very touching. It made me wonder about the fates of these students and wonder what they did with all their wonderful potential.
