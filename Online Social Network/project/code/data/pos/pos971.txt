1. wear comfortable shoes because you have to walk up a steep hill no matter where you park (tragic) 
2. wear layers - it gets cold at night
3. bring a blanket to sit on
4. be mindful of the holes in the pavement on Gayley - wouldn't want a broken/twisted ankle
5. if you park at the lower hearst lot ($20), make sure your car is facing toward the entrance/exit
