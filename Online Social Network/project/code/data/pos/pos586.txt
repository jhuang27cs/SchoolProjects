I love Modern Eye and  have been going to this place since forever! Dale and Kate are the absolute best! The other staff members are super helpful and very nice. Drs Chris and Bryan are knowledgeable, downt to earth and approachable. I have a friend, who flies in from London just to get her eye exam and glasses here. You can't go wrong going to Modern Eye.
