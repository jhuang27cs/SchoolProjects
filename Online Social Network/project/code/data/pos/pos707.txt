Working in Cambridge just got that much better! 

The Madame X latte was amazing and I always love the added touch of "foam art." The flavors were complex without being too sweet or masking the espresso (the most important part) 

The front counter reminded me of a cupcake shop but the rest was reminiscent of your friend's cool trendy loft with lots of original art. 

I hate to complain about the food because really there is nothing that goes well with coffee that isn't a dessert. Buuuuut, while I appreciate the effort of trying to offer sandwiches, they don't hold a candle to the inspiration behind the lattes.

Although I do LOVE ants on a log....
