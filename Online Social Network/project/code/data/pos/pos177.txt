3 people can easily feast off of the steamed seafood platter. It was generously laden with snow crab legs, oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, sausage, and potatoes. 

I liked the cornmeal dusted fried oysters. Very generous serving. Share the fried oyster basket as an appetizer for a group of 4 or more. 

The gumbo wasn't that great--spicy but rather tasteless at the same time.
