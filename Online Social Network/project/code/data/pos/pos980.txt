I feel especially comfortable eating here, probably because of the strong Cali/LA vibe they've got going on: loads of natural light, salad, iced tea, and fancy pizza.

In my world, CPK invented the bbq chicken pizza, and for that I am grateful. The frozen ones they sell at the market hardly do justice to the real thing, though. They make a mean spinach dip here, too. Check it out.
