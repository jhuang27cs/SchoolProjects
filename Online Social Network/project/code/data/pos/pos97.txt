Went here after the Yelp Elite event last night...this was an old haunt for the bf who used to live in H Sq. I had heard various things about it from him and others, and so the anticipation and expectations were built up. 

Cambridge 1 did not disappoint in the least. 

We only had to wait a few minutes for a table, during which we ordered beer (yesss, wachusett bberry) and munched on those awesome breadsticks (what is that little kick? It's incredible!) Once we sat down, our waitress immediately recognized my bf, and vice versa - he used to be a regular back in the day. I always give bonus points for places that remember customers...that whole Cheers dynamic (the show, not the stupid bar in Fanueil). 

We each ordered halves, since he wanted pepperoni and I wanted to try a veg one. They came out in a timely fashion (not busy) and we were both in heaven before long. I got the tomatoes onions cheeses one, and the onions were carmelized...best way ever to eat onions! The crust was super thin, but had a lot of gooey flavor and was crispy too. I thought it was bigger than I needed for that night, but the bf ate every last bite of his (side note: I have never seen such large pepperoni pieces in my life). Looking around, the salads looked awesome as well and I was sad I had munched away so much at the event beforehand to enjoy one of those too. 

This is also a great date place, as evidenced by the 73 dates going on around us. I know this isn't our last date here, that's for damn sure!! 

XOX Cambridge 1. I heart you!
