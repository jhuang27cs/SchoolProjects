I have to admit I haven't been here in a while. Back in the day, this was the cool movie place to go. They had first runs of all the new indie films that no one else would show.  I remember going here to see Bent, It's In The Water and a lot of other crazy stuff.  The staff was always friendly and the crowds were usually serious movie buffs who would actually remain quiet.  With the advent of Netflix, etc, I'm not sure there's as much of a need for theaters like this anymore.  But I do still occasionally go and it's always fun.
