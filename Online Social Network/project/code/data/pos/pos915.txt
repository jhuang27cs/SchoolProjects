This is a great store. Lots of staple items like t-shirts, undershirts, etc. It's all made in the US. The company has some rather unsavory sex scandals that have put it in the news lately. If you can get over that, and are interested in buying clothes that are made in USA, it's a good bet. They stock many different sizes for all their clothes. In fact, there are lots of clothes for small people here (seriously: I'm a dude with shirt size of 14 1/2 and I find shirts here every time). I honestly don't know what the previous reviewer was talking about. I'm very hard to fit and I always leave with tons of stuff. In fact, it's literally the only store in Providence where I can find shirts that actually fit me.

So, why not five stars? Well, it's really expensive. Like $20 dollars for the most basic t-shirt...and it goes up from there. The cheapest button down shirt (totally plain) is like $50+ dollars. Next, the return policy sucks. No cash refunds whatsoever. Even if you bought the item ten minutes before. Only store credit. Third, sex scandals/union busting. Seriously, we're being asked to trade in sketchy overseas labor exploitation (but with good prices) for weird porn culture advertising, union busting domestic labor practices, and corporate sex scandals (not to mention high, high prices.)

Aren't there any companies that are just...you know, good?
