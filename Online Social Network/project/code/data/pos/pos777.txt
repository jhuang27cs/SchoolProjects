First time here, and it was an awkward situation. So we had the meal deal, and was totally lost what we needed to do. The fries were good and so were the wrap that comes with it. It was very tasty and I thought I couldnt get full on it or would be hungry an hour later, both of which proved to be untrue. You can add the vegetables to your wrap, but I ate it the way it is. The seating is funky, it's almost like community seating.  Healthy? Probably not as much as it should be for a vegetarian place, they fried most of the wrap and fries
