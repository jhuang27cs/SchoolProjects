Verizon Wireless--Westwood. OMG. I have one word for this store. Amazing. Everyone is very attentive and sweet. I think within the last 3 weeks I was into the store at least 4 times before I actually "pulled the trigger" and upgraded phones/merged on to the family plan. One particular associate, Erik, is a total gem. He blew everyone out of the water. He knew what he was talking about and was honest as far as what would be the best deal for me. I didn't feel pressured or felt like a piece of sale if that makes sense. Haha but seriously!  I definitely recommend Erik to everyone. You will feel confident and excited about your purchase/upgrade because you will leave there knowing you had a real conversation with a real person that actually cares! Erik, you rocked it!
