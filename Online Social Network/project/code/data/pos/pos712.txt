it depends on what type of person you are when you go here. if you want to go somewhere to sit down and be served on hand and foot, it's not for you. if you don't mind getting your own dishes, drinks and water, then this place is great for you!!
the prices are pretty good (6-12 dollars an item) and the food is so very tasty. i go here all the time!
