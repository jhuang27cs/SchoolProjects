Looking for a spot to grab a bite, fire up my laptop and catch a few games before heading out of town, I stumbled upon Marlow's Tavern shortly after checking out of my hotel, 

The setup worked for me; spacious and clean yet still a bit cozy. I was quickly greeted and escorted to a booth where I was promptly approached by Corey, my awesome server. He was attentive, pleasant and friendly without being overbearing or disruptive. I swear, I must have drank an entire liter of Diet Coke thanks to Corey, Whenever my Diet Coke was even running relatively low, I would turn around and Corey had already replaced it with a fresh one. 

I ordered the two mini sliders from the Kid's Menu and a side of parmesan truffle fries and within 15 minutes or so, these bad boys were placed directly in front of me. 

The fries were so insanely delicious that I felt my eyes cross after tasting the first one. I know that may not sound very sexy, but think of it as a very mild food orgasm. Just, with crossed eyes, instead of curled toes.

I was also really pleased to find that the mini burgers were small, but still hefty enough to completely fill me up. 

I guess everything *is* bigger in the south!
