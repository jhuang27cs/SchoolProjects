I really like this place. I've heard its owned by the same people who own Daisy Mint. If that's true, then I guess that explains why I like their food so much. For those of you who haven't gone there, that's a great Thai place. Probably my favorite Thai place in Pasadena.

But I digress. 
Abricott is a great place. It's sort of like one of those quaint places that you find and you like to take your friends there just to have a great bite to eat. It's not a super fancy place and it can remind you of a library with all the books around, but I think that adds character to the place.

I've had the Pho and the Pork Belly Sandwich. The pho is not cheap at $10 when compared to other places like Golden Deli and Pho 79, but I think it's definitely higher quality than those places. The meat is especially tender and delicious.

The pork belly sandwich tastes so delicious that it's probably not good for you. If you're having a cholesterol test tomorrow, I'd recommend not getting this. Definitely come back to eat it after your test.

All in all, I really like this place and I can't wait to come back!
