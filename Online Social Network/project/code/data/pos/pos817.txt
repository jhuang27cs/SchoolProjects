I would like to take some time to address some reviews of this place.

First off, this spot is catered to a niche market. 

1) Do you like fruit?
2) Do you like refreshing, light, healthy snack with high quality ingredients?
3) Are you willing to pay a buck more for it?

Then the Fruit Palette is for you!

This store emphasizes QUALITY and CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I'd argue that the prices are in line with getting an ice cream (without the excess calories).  

Fresh fruit costs A LOT more than processed dairy products loaded with sugars.

Customer service is amazing.  I went in there to buy 5 frozen fruit bars, and the owner gave me the bars and a FREE cooler to bring them home packed in some ice.  He just said keep it and use it next time you come back.  In addition there is a frequent customer card so that after you buy a few you get one free.  Not only that, he rounded down the price so wouldn't have to break a dollar. 

Overall, I think it's still a great value for the quality of the product offered.
