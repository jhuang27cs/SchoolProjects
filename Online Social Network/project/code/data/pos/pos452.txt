I went here on a night they were having a trivia night. 

Our waiter was incredibly well versed regarding the menu and was extensively attentive. The bread with olive oil was delicious (and I justified eating an extra piece with an "its healthier than butter" in my head.)

The food was delicious (I had the Chilled Asparagus Vichyssoise with truffled bacon crumble & country hen organic egg and Misty Knoll Farm Spring Roast Chicken with celery, farro & golden mushrooms), all served without delay and the entire experience was a positive one. 

Wonderful experiences here, I will definitely be back.
