I bring the family matriarch up to Hungry Mother every year for Mother's Day.  She thinks it's hilarious.  She's got some real Southern roots, coming up in Virginia, and she says the food is spot-on.  I trust her, because I don't think my taste buds are lying to me, either.

The people are fantastic and really do care about your experience.  They'll check on you, but not at inappropriate times or excessively short intervals, and they're very quick to correct any problems that may arise.

The food will simply blow you away.  These guys are no slouches, they know how to cook and they know the cuisine.  They'll also surprise you with unexpected twists on your prototypical Southern fare.  I have to recommend the sweet tea, which is definitely about as authentic as you'll find North of Maryland.  And if you're in the mood, the house cocktails are tasty and unique.

For all this you can expect to spend some real money, but that shouldn't deter you.  It's well worth it.
