Urban Outfitters in general has plenty of fun stuff, great to pick up one or two items that are very "of the moment" knowing that moment will pass.  But what's great about this location is the discount basement.  It's very hit or miss but I've SCORED some great deals there - and it's always on clothing that people ask me about for years afterwards.
