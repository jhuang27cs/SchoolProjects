Yes, it's pricey, so we save it for special occasions or when my wife's grandfather is in town and paying :)

That being said, I've been looking forward to this summer since last fall, because nothing beats the traditional lobster on the patio. With coleslaw! and potatoes! and salad!

I almost forgot - the bread and olives (sometimes you have to ask) are delish and keep my blood sugar up!
