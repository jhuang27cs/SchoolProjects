My boyfriend always raved about the Raven Grill so I came over here for lunch with a friend one day.

This place is pretty unique.  I really like the lay out of the restaurant and it has this super chill atmosphere.  The server was nice and I can see myself coming here having more lunch dates with my girlfriends :) 

Okay, food... I tried their Grilled Salmon Salad (dressing on the side of course!).  The salmon was grilled almost perfect.  I typically do not like cooked salmon, but this one was tasty.  The lemon caper vinaigrette was very flavorful and paired well with the salmon.  The serving size of this dish was huge as well.  I was pretty stuffed afterwards and was ready for a nap.  

Since I was here with a friend and not my boyfriend, I acted like a lady and had one item and no appetizer nor dessert.  I know... very out of character for myself, but I'll be back to try more items :) 

The parking lot here is interesting... it's a one-way and there didn't seem to be a lot of parking slots (so you might want to try street parking if there are any).  This place seems casual so I don't think there's a dress code.
