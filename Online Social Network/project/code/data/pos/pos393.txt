Highly recommend the pizzas and mussels.  (The mussels are consistently fresher and better than other bistros we've tried).
One service note from last evening: we ordered the fried calamari and were told by the waiter that they were "out."  During our meal we observed a neighboring diner with....fried calamari. Our (very attentive) waiter was nonplussed, and the manager came over to explain what had happened--that there were no calamari when we ordered because the kitchen, in its pursuit of ultra-fresh ingredients, does not prepare batter if insufficient demand is projected, and it so happened that after an interval the kitchen decided to go into production mode.  I guess it all has to do with the way this restaurant works.  We were ordering at 7 PM on a Saturday, so one might expect that more or less generic menu items would be available.  At any rate, we thought that perhaps the manager would offer complimentary coffee or dessert, but that didn't happen.
