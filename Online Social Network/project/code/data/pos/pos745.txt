Live jazz with a vocalist! (If you come on the right night.) Beautiful rolling water sculpture! Really friendly service, too!

I came to Providence to Waterfire to propose to my (now) fiance, and they worked with the Hotel Providence to be sure that a dozen roses that I bought off site were at our table when we arrived to kick off a magical engagement weekend.

We even lucked out with a wine bump when the wine we ordered was 'out of stock,' and to top it off, our food was absolutely delicious. Order the scallops! Seriously.

I can't thank the staff here enough for such a pleasant dinner to start things rolling with my eventual proposal. Thank you! I would definitely eat here again.
