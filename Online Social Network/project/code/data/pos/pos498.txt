have lived in pgh for a few years now, and allegro has become my go-to bakery for weekly bread and special occasion pastries.  mediterra "bakehouse" bread doesn't even compare to the true, artisan bread that i've gotten from allegro.  love their rye selection and sourdough especially!

as for the sweets, the chocolate cake is amazing! have yet to find a more moist and rich cake in the city.  i always get cupcakes for when i visit my folks - they love them! 

can't walk past it without wanting to go in--heavenly smells!

this is a good, traditional bakery, with consistent quality.  don't come here expecting bacon on your cupcakes.  they don't cater to food fads.
