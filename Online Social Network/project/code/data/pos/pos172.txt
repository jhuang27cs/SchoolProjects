I never found myself really craving burgers until I came here with a friend; now Uburger is now my number one all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onion on a (non) sesame seed bun destination in Boston.  Even the plain hamburger is full of flavor and moist, like the ideal backyard grill burger.  Customization options are pretty much endless.  Prices seem high if you're comparing them to McDonald's or Burger King, but in the context of other Boston sandwich shops, they're right in line.  (Besides which, if you're in the mood for a really great hamburger and you run across the street to McDonald's just to save a few bucks, you're abusing your tastebuds, and the state WILL come and take them away until you learn to be a better caretaker.)  My only real complaint is the forgettable fries -- crispy and fresh, but no real flavor.  If you're doing takeout, this is where the the trip to McDonald's is perfectly justifiable.  Uburger does have a pretty nice dining area boasting a bigscreen TV, but its proximity to BU and Fenway could see it fill up fast...
