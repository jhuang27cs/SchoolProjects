I am glad that I was brought to Ithaca to study and got the chance of living with Purity ice cream in the past few years. My taste buds tell me that their ice-cream are freshly-made without much preservatives. For ice-cream, I like the flavor of coffee and chocolate. Purity mix the coffee and chocolate flavor ice-cream in various way making them all of my favorite flavors. Mocha Chip, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Gimme Mocha Fudge, Peppermint Chocolate, all taste excellent! They are generous in scooping the ice-cream. I think Junior size is like a 1-scoop size, while 1-scoop is like a 2-scoop.
