Today was a great day to stroll outside since it was sunny and just a little "nippy" with the cool wind blowing. A friend and I were strolling around University Village and went into Crate and Barrel for her to find a gift for a wedding. This is one of my top favorite household/furnishing stores.   I love receiving their seasonal catalogs almost as much as the big phone-book size IKEA catalog.  When I receive it I like to close my eyes and picture my place looking just as comfy and inviting as their model rooms not to mention as spotless.  They have affordable houseware items.  I have purchased my dishes, silverware, glasses and placemats from this store as well as various vases and decorative bowls.  I like their items because they can be unique but also classic so you don't have to replace them every couple of years or so.  With the glassware just be careful since some of them tend to be a little more fragile then others if the glass is very thin.  I wish I could afford their furniture as well but alas it was not meant to be this last year but there is still hope for 2008.  I got my eye on one of their dining rooms sets. Santa had said there was no room in the sleigh for it but I told him this year there is definitely room for a gift card there.
