Been a fan of natural history museum for years! Love the new dinosaur hall!! Thomas the T. Rex is sooo cool !

Parking is $10 cash only, private parking lot, admission is $9 for students and seniors, $12 for adults. They offer 13 FREE Tuesdays a year, check out their site for exact free Tuesday dates. They have daily tours and animal meet and greet, which are great for your visit. 

The new dinosaur hall is just amazing! Thomas the T. Rex captured my attention, it is one of the ten most complete T.Rex specimens on earth. They brought ancient animals to life! You can find out everything and anything you want to know about dinosaurs! Huge hall with 2 stories, you can have a very good view of the entire dinosaur hall upstairs. We are very into dinosaurs so we spent most of our time there, lots of questions were answered. The T. Rex growth series, how old are those dinosaurs, how the archeologists brought them to life, where they were found...very educational, and sooo cool! They have lots of other exhibitions too,  mammal halls, birds, insect halls, gemstone vault, archeological treasure, California history....etc, depends on what you like, you can spend more time there, I think it is gonna take a whole day to visit every hall thoroughly, it's just too much walking for me. 

They have a cafe downstairs, good selection of food, snacks, healthy snacks, drinks, sandwich, burger... lots to choose from. It was great to sit down and have some food n beverages to recharge energy, we needed that for the visit! 

Don't forget to visit the museum stores, there are so many cute things, we got a few goodies at dinosaur store. :)

The staffs were very friendly and helpful. It was packed on a holiday Monday, lots of kids, family and couples. Great place for a family day, or date day, fun and educational!

They are currently doing many constructions both inside and outside, with that 13 million donation, they are gonna have lots of new things coming to this museum! Can't wait!!! :)
