Pretty good Korean restaurant to go to for a very cheap price. The Korean lady who owns this place is really friendly and engages with a lot of her customers while they're waiting for their food. 

I had their ddukbokki, which, IMO, isn't the best I had. (Go to Cafe Expresso for that!) I was really disappointed because everything else that I tried at Bear Ramen was good. Also tried their Curry Rice (yummmm) and Kimchi Fried Noodles (so goodddd). 

The downside: they only accept cash and the place is extremely tiny! It gets quite crowded sometimes.
