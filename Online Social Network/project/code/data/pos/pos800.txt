I've done the taste test and now I can safely say that if you are on Telegraph Avenue, craving pizza, but unable to choose between Blondies and Fat Slice....Go for Blondies.  Hands down.

I always choose Blondies, but I was never quite sure why till the other night when we got a slice of pepperoni pizza at each location.  The pizza from Fat Slice lost points early on because the pepperoni topping was so sparce...I could literally count on one hand all the pepperoni pieces on the slice.  The Blondies slice on the other hand was covered with crisp juicy slices of pepperoni...

Fat Slice does live up to its name, the slices are extremely thick and doughy and also covered with a thick coating of cheese and a very light layer of sauce.  Unfortunately the extra cheese didn't turn out to be a good thing....it was so thick that it overwhelmed the pizza and became tough as the pizza cooled down.

All in all Blondies is a much better choice for any pizza craving.  It's not going to be the best pizza you'll ever have but it's a pretty solid choice for by-the-slice pizza eating.  The crust is thick and crisp, the toppings are abundant and the cheese is greasy and gooey as it should be.  

Don't trust me though, do the taste test yourself...
