this is definitely a bar where everyone knows your name.  or at least the bartenders do, in addition to taking the effort to light your cigarette [back in the day when smoking was allowed indoors] and serve the free eggs that float around as an appetizer complete with tabasco, salt and pepper.  the menu changes regularly, season to season.  although a bit expensive, the staples, such as the arugula salad and mussels, are outstanding.  my new addiction, especially after a few:  blue cheese fries.  yum.

atmosphere is everything to this establishment...music is low key until later at night.  i've been a regular here since six years ago, when i first moved to boston.  rob has always been the best bartender, now a father to ellis.  he still makes the martinis the way i like them.

besides martinis, the bside stocks and mixes a variety of other libations.  one to try, which is their signature sweet drink, is the stardust.  mixed into a lavender shade, definitely a must-try.
