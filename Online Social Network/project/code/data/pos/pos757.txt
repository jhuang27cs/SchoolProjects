First time here as a few of my friends live in the neighborhood, and I loved it!
The food was delicious and inventive and the service was casual and friendly.  There was short wait for a table which we didn't mind at all, and relaxed at the bar for a drink while we waited.  I have to say it is a nice little bar and the bartender was great.  This is exactly the kind of neighhborhood placeI love to find in NYC.   I will definitely be back and might possibly make the trip uptown for it!
