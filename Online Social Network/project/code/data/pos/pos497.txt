Another institution of Seattle's unique/hipster coffee houses 

I have to say the District is perfect harboring ground; combine that with college kids, alternative-electro music, and caffeine and you've got yourself a gem. 
The space is nice and big, making it great for pulling up a spot at the bar or holding study at the grande tables. Each of the areas are unique unto itself. 
I've heard great things about the espresso and food, but the tea there is weak. 
Oh and right as you walk in there are a ton of board games, papers etc. Keep your eyes peeled for this little spot otherwise it can be easy to just walk right on past.
