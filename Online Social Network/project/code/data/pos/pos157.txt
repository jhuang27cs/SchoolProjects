I love this place. Whenever my family has a special occasion, we jump in the van and head for fondue. The fondue is simply the best in the area. How can you not have a good time with laughing conversations with family and friends over bubbling cheese pots (and meatball pots, seriously, try the meatball pot!) As much as I love the food, and I really really love the food, the service has me coming back just as much. The owner lady feels like my middle eastern mom that wants me to eat more bread and potatoes. She also wants to send me home with my empty coke bottle filled with her mustard salad dressing that I can't get enough of, true story. I love this place, and if you love fondue, you really need to give it a try.
