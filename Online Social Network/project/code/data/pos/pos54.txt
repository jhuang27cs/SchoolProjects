Matsuri is pleasantly surprising.  I generally don't expect any authentic asian cuisine in Pasadena but that is how many of the yelp reviews described Matsuri and I can see why.

Upon your arrival, you are greeted by a little drumming.  A little hokey, for sure, but still a little charming.  All the staff are Japanese with cute accents - not blonde Pasadena socialites.  

The food actually tastes homey and handmade too.  

Appetizers:  JALAPENO BOMBERS - jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and fish roe and tempura fried with kewpie mayo and siracha sauce.   I'm not a fan of cream cheese appetizers so this was good, but not my favorite.  I did like the heat of the jalapenos though.  SHI-SO HOT; tempura fried shisho leaf topped with spicy tuna and a drizzling of eel sauce.  This was GREAT.  I was slightly disappointed that the shiso didn't add much flavor but the crisp worked wonderfully in holding up the tuna, which matched very well with the sweet sauce.  GYOZAS are great - handmade with a light loose veggie filling.  

Boyfriend ordered the HAMBURG steak, three thin patties of ground beef with a pan fried crisp bottom and slathered with a homemade ketchup.  It comes with a side of cabbage slaw, potato salad and a wedge of cantaloupe.  Boyfriend liked the potato salad, which had cucumber slices inside. 

I ordered the MATSURI CHIRASHI, which came loaded with julienned daikon, furikaka sprinkled over the rice, and a selection of fishes - 3 tuna, 2 tamago, 1 salmon, a pile of ikura,  clam, eel, mackerel and I forget the rest.  

Friend ordered the SPICY TUNA SALAD, which he enjoyed.  

The cooked entrees are all very reasonably priced at under $15 .  Me likes!
