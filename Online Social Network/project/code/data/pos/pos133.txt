i've tried alot of fro-yo, from berkeley to seattle, I think this has the best original fro-yo. It doesn't have other flavors like it's counterparts but the original has the special tangy taste that mimics the yogurt drinks very well. 

So far I haven't found any other place that has a better tangy taste.

Other reviewers has mentioned that the guy working there is stingy and bias. Yes its true, he gives me the same feelings. He acts like he's counting how much fruit he is putting in your cup. But he has hired someone new and she's very nice. Hopefully she'll be working when you get there. haha
