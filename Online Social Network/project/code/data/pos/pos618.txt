When it comes to frozen yogurt, you can't really get better than 30 cents an ounce. I've been to both yogurtland locations on berkeley, but I like the one at bancroft much better because it's much roomier and they have more machines than the store on shattuck.

I really like their strawberry because it tastes like real yogurt instead of throwing a ton of strawberry puree into a batch of original tart. All the fruit flavors are very good and very tasty, and the strawberry-banana surprised me too because you could taste it as a medley and individually at the same time (mind blown). Their topping selection is very standard, with the exception of the ghiradelli sauces they had. 

If you have time, you should go to both stores because they're relatively close to each other and they might not have the flavor you want. It'll definitely be worth the walk and wait.

I highly recommend you go here because of the vast selection and quality. Plus, I really like frozen yogurt. =]
