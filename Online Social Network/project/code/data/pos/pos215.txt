Great new place in the (poor) Ithaca culinary landscape. While the dinner menu is relatively uninspiring, the brunch menu is creative and full of southwestern flavors. I personally tried the "Del Mar" fish tacos, and the huevos rancheros - both above average. The grits was delicious as well.
Desserts are tasty and well-made (I suggest the pineapple upside-down cake). Good wine and drinks list.

The restaurant interiors are nice, with a modern yet traditional feeling (it seems to be in Colorado rather than in Ithaca!). I give the place 4 and not 5 stars because the service is somewhat slow and sloppy - I am sure this will improve with time and with more training.

A happy new discovery!
