Great place for poor students like myself
most dishes are around 5 bucks and the taste is ok

the service is great
most employers are very friendly 
once they even gave me free bowl of white rice :D

Even though the place isn't that clean, well it's Berkeley...
if you can't stand this, you should consider living somewhere else
