My bf and I finally decided to brave the long lines at Sprinkles after weeks of waiting. Turned out that we came at the perfect time because we only waited 17 minutes! Woohoo!

We ordered the Mocha, Coconut, Red Velvet, and Lemon cupcakes. All four were very tasty, though the Mocha was my least favorite because it was a tad too sweet (and this is coming from someone with the biggest sweet tooth ever). The Red Velvet is good but overrated. And the Coconut was my favorite out of all 4... highly recommend it!

Can't wait to come back and try the Chai Latte and Pumpkin cupcakes. I'd give it 5 stars if this place weren't so pricey :S
