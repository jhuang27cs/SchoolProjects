"Fang gave me a layered razor cut and a straight razor neck shave."

It's not often you get to say a sentence like that without being into S&M... but don't worry... Fang is a woman... and she didn't abuse me at all! Quite the opposite! 

Hands down, the best $25 haircut I've recieved in Atlanta! (Also my first, but, hey... if it's not broke, don't fix it.)

I made an on-line reservation, walked right in and was offered a Coke!
The haircut was super solid!
Neck shave with a straight razor!
Hot Towel!
and... Eye Brow Trim? 

Uh... Ok... I guess I needed it? 

What else can I say? It was a great experience all around! Friendly staff that instinctively understood that I like my haircuts like I like my women... smart, efficient, and lathered in shaving cream! 

I'll be back!
