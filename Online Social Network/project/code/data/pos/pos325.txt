Okay, everyone knows that in-n-out is amazing... so ill talk about the facility. the parking sucks because its westwood, but there's some metered parking across the street by the gas station. there's sometimes ENORMOUS lines that go into the main street because of the volume of people in the drive through which is pretty annoying.  if your'e walking though, this place is pretty good... its def one of the largest in-n-outs i've been too. probably a good choice on behalf of the owners, with the ucla and those USC students who invade westwood.

great service, as  i think some of the people who work there are also students.
