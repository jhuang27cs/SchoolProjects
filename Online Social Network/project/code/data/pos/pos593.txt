I was visiting Palo Alto and on a chilly trip to the Stanford Shopping Center I stumbled upon Sprinkles Cupcakes. It was super packed and I just had to go in. The first thing I noticed was the variety of cupcakes from vegan versions to carrot cake cupcakes ahhh! I went with the very popular red velvet and it was delicious. I even took some to go! The staff was extremely friendly considering the gloomy day outside (it was around Xmas). 

This summer I was back in town and surely made a stop for my birthday and skipped the cake. They can run a bit pricey but worth the splurge. It will definitely be a tradition of mine to stop at Sprinkles whenever I'm in town again!
