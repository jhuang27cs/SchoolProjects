A lot of things about this jazz club rock (ironic, I know).  The door guys were super professional and polite.  The space to work with inside is narrow, so they offered to put the guitar I had with me in their office to get it out of the way, which was very helpful.  We saw urban soul-jazz singer Gregory Generet there performing.  He's an excellent singer with a tight band and they put on a kick ass show.  The only complaint I have is that they expect you to purchase a 2 course meal.  I thought just ordering beer would be good enough, but apparently not, I was told I'd need to order at least an entree.  To the waitress's credit though, she conceded and said it'd be cool if I just ordered an appetizer.  I got the french onion soup, it was excellent.  I sampled a bit of everything, and it was all good.  I highly recommend this venue, just beware that if you go and don't order food when sitting at the table, you're gonna get the stink eye   : )
