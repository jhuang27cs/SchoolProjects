See below for my reviews of the general establishment.  Individual cupcake reviews (I've tried most -of them!) follow.  Note that these are based on my personal tastes (chocolate is better than vanilla, the darker the better, and buttercream frosting is better than cream cheese frosting):  

***Dark Chocolate***: I know it's too rich for some people, but if you love dark chocolate this cupcake is to die for.   Moist dark chocolate cake and rich, bittersweet buttercream frosting.   They use the finest quality chocolate and you can tell.  This is my #1 cupcake of all time, here or anywhere else.
***Mocha***: A close second to the dark chocolate, this has the same cake as the dark chocolate and a very similar frosting, but it has a mocha flavor as well.  It is powerful but not overwhelming and is really, really excellent as well.
***Banana***: Another cupcake they do very well.  It is available with vanilla or dark chocolate frosting, and sometimes milk chocolate frosting (off-the-menu).   I obviously prefer it with dark chocolate, but my bf loves the vanilla (it is his favorite Sprinkles cupcake in fact).  The cake is moist and has a nice banana flavor without being too strong.   
***Milk Chocolate***: These cupcakes have milk chocolate frosting, and either a vanilla cake part (Vanilla Milk Chocolate) or a dark chocolate cake base (Milk Chocolate).  Obviously, I prefer dark over milk chocolate but I think the frosting is still pretty good, although it is cream cheese-based, rather than butter-based, and thus has a different taste.  I also think the dark chocolate cake is moister than the vanilla cake.   
***Vanilla***: This is vanilla cake with vanilla frosting.   I found this boring and bland (and also think their vanilla cake is too dry).
***Red Velvet***: Probably their most popular, but I think it is over-hyped.  I am not a huge fan of red velvet cupcakes in general, but I don't like these.  The frosting is ok (considering I'm not a cream cheese frosting person and I like it pretty well, it must be pretty good), but I find the cake part way too oily.   Also the red food coloring they use bleeds all over your hands when you're eating it.
***Strawberry***: This one is WAY too sweet.   I like strawberries fairly well, but this cupcake just has an incredibly overpowering sweetness that makes it hard to eat.  
***Cinnamon Sugar***: This "cupcake" has no frosting and tastes basically like a muffin.   It is a fairly bland muffin at that (no fruit, no chocolate, etc) and is pretty dry.  It was edible, but not better than a typical grocery store muffin and certainly not worth $3.25
***Chai Latte***: The cardamom is overpowering.  I like chai tea, but I didn't like this cupcake at all.  Half of it went in the trash.
***Peanut Butter Chip***: I like the cake part, which has a very mild peanut butter flavor and chocolate chips throughout (even better when slightly melted) and the frosting has a strong peanut flavor, but you get the chocolate flavor from the chocolate sprinkles.  Pretty good.
***Orange***: I don't eat oranges, but my boyfriend liked it alright.  No raves though.
***Pumpkin***: Nice, lightly spiced pumpkin cake and cinnamon cream cheese frosting.  The frosting is not my favorite (cream cheese) and is a little too sweet, but its balanced by the pumpkin cupcake.   This is one of my favorite non-chocolate cupcakes.
***Key Lime*** (seasonal):  I don't like key lime flavor.  My boyfriend liked it reasonably well, but didn't give it any raves.
***Lemon Blueberry*** (seasonal): We didn't hate it, but given how much we both like blueberries, this cupcake is not the best.
***Summer Cherry*** (seasonal): I didn't try (I hate cherries) but my boyfriend was not a fan at all, and said this might be the worst Sprinkles cupcake he tried.
***Raspberry*** (seasonal):  I really hated it, but my boyfriend loved it, so I guess it depends on your raspberry threshold (it is VERY raspberry-ey and also verrryyyy sweet...I thought it tasted like cough medicine).
***Almond Dark Chocolate***(seasonal): Dark chocolate frosting that I love, of course, but the almond cake is terrible.  I like almonds fairly well, and I don't mind the nuts in the cake even though they are a little soggy.  But they used about 10 times too much almond extract and so the cake has an incredibly overpowering, artificial flavor (and smell!)
***Flourless Chcolate***(seasonal) They only have this the week of Passover, but it is outstanding.   It tastes much more like a brownie than a normal cupcake and comes with a vanilla glaze instead of frosting, but its really really good.    

I don't recommend the "minis" that they've introduced now.  Its a tempting idea - cheaper & a smaller portion size, but they're SO small (one bite, basically) that its hardly worth $2.   They're also a bit drier than the regulars and the frosting is plopped on  & not spread out.
