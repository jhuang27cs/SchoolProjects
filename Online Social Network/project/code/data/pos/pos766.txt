Elegant with eclectic hues, Elaine's  has a welcoming aura for  all age groups & styles.  This isn't necessarily a "jacket required" establishment because I've seen people with casual shorts and a nice shirt or top.  

Elaine's does harbor class and sophistication as does those who patronize the restaurant, but the cool thing about  this place is that their servers are allowed to where nose rings and those round ear discs.  A very different kind of fine dining.  This does not by any means take away from the fine style and service that Elaine's offers.

I had a delicious roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and a lovely strawberry shortbread cake with creme fraiche for dessert.  The wine was selected by Phillip the bar dream-- I believe it was a Riesling. The meal was lovely-- ask for Phillip at the bar or his section near the bar-- he's a good friend of mine-- he will make you feel at home and special.

Through Phillip I've met Mike and GJ-- two other very awesome servers.  They will take excellent care of you as well.
