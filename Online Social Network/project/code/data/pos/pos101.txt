A few years ago I got the bright idea to relive my childhood by rolling down Miller Outdoor Theater's glorious hill. The grass and I didn't mix well, and I ended up with a funny rash on my body which lasted for days. I tell you this because despite the fact that MOT left me a not-so-fancy parting gift, I STILL LOVE IT AND GO BACK (but I don't roll down the hill anymore). 

I spent a lot of time there this Spring, on sunny but cool afternoons, with a frisbee and some friends. Man oh man do I love having picnics, and this is such a perfect spot. Parking can be nasty for big events, in fact it was kind of a nightmare this evening during the July 4th festivities (Houston Symphony--excellent!), but I definitely don't mind walking. I think anytime you find a wonderful picnic spot in Houston you need to treasure it forever and that's what I try to do. So impress a date by packing a picnic or take some friends and you'll have a wonderful afternoon. Check out the calendar of events and get some culture in your life!

And the best part? It's ALL FREE.
