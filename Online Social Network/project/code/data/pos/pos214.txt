On a chilly day in San Francisco, I wish I could take a quick flight to Ann Arbor to enjoy Le Dog's soups. During the winter I would come here once to twice a week since I worked less than 1 minute away. I mistakenly asked if the soup is good when I meant to ask which soup is better. The guy in the back loudly said something along the lines of not making soup that is bad. Very true. I feel like I have tried all of the soups and they are all excellent!
