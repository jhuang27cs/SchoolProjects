I live around the corner from this place and have only been a handful of times, but that was my mistake. 

Last week I had an awesome dinner while sitting at the bar and making my way through the list of exotic beer taps. 

Here's what I love about 1018 aside from the sophisticated and friendly vibe and big open windows: The owner is anal about serving organic, fresh products and that's good. 

Rumor has it that he's working on a rootop garden and within one year plans to grow all his vegetables on the premises. 

With my newfound appreciation for salads (yes, salads!) and healthy food, Bistro 1018 is definitely going to be a common stop for this cowboy.
