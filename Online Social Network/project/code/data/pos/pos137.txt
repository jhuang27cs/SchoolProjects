Utopia on SATURDAY night (also known as the Sol Fusion event hosted by J.Carter of Sugarhill and Marco of Marcos Pitas on Ponce) was FAR more than I bargained for. I'm SO not the "clubbing" type, but I don't mind dancing from time to time. So I'm invited out for a 30+ B-day celebration and am SO pleasantly surprised. For the "non club" type like myself, there are OPTIONS!!!! OK, on the first floor, it's more like a restaurant, but the dj (salah ananse) spins house. Then downstairs has more of a lounge-feel, and the djs spin 80's music. (let me just insert that the restrooms are QUITE innovative... check out the one downstairs if you get the chance)... i have a thing with clean, well-designed restrooms in restaurants/lounges... Anywho, back to the important stuff... In the "club" room, there are 2 privacy suites, but other than that, it's wide open with a cool dj set-up. So for my set of friends, this outlet was perfect b/c we could spend time in each area to equally satisfy the preferences of all of us. And I tasted a drink called the Buttery Nipple and it was delish. I didn't eat any food, so I can't vouch for it, but I will say that the ambiance was QUITE enjoyable... this event targets the 25-30+ crowd... so no "music video" attire!!! :-)... and oh yeah, it's FREE before a certain time. I think 10 or 11...
