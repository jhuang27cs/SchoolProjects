Good selection on beer (for a sports bar) and decent beer prices.  Food is a tad more than I would expect at a sports bar, but it is very good, and definitely worth it.  Lots of TVs, but not all HD (forgivable, I suppose).  Home town bias when it comes to teams and airplay (as it should be).  It's tough to get a certain game on, however, if it doesn't involve a local team.  This is understandable, but I don't see why they can't dedicate one of the smaller ones to other games, and leave the local games on the main/big tvs.  Last thing to add is that it is not really that big, so just keep that in mind.

Currently my go-to sports bar in Ann Arbor, but it's really the only place I've been to besides Wild Wings, which doesn't count.  (Local bars always trump national chains.)
