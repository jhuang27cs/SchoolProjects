For being in the U Village this Aveda store is actually really great, plus it's right across from Fran's.  Every time I go in here I'm greeted with a warm and friendly hello and hot tea, tea so hot it burns your mouth but its good tea just very hot so be careful when you accept it.

I love walking in and saying I want to find something that will help with 'this' problem and with in seconds I have products in front of me to play with and smell and try and with a little more talking I'm able to find a product that fixes my problem.  Plus I love all their travel size products, I'm never pushed to buy the full size but to try the travel size to see if I really like it and that it works and if it doesn't they are great with returns.
