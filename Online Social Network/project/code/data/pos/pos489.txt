Finally, a dentist who knows what he is doing and doesn't just rush you out the door!  I was in search for a good dentist for a while now and I finally found one who is kind, respectful, and hardworking.  The dentist worked thoroughly with me fill in all my previous cavities and gave me my cleaning.  

The office is new, the staff are nice and caring, and the environment is clean, with state-of-the-art equipment.  I didn't feel pressured to purchase anything or have any new procedures.  He offered suggestions but that was great since it helped me become aware of having better hygiene, otherwise it would lead to additional work.  This is was admirable since many  dentists don't waste their time to talk with you, or suggest better steps to better dental care! Dr. Hamidy does spend extra time to chat with you and get to know you before hand so it helps with your jitters if you have any.

I would definitely recommend anyone who is tired of searching for a great dentist! I am confident that I will be bringing my family over and hopefully, have Dr. Hamidy be our lifelong dentist !
