Sockos = best subs that I have ever had. I usually get the vegetarian one with pesto and avocado on a french roll and it is delicious. Fresh, crisp, cool and the french roll is just to die for. It has just the right amount of crispness on the outside, but still really soft and delicious.

The price isn't bad for what you get and they're really friendly.

Only down side: Didn't exactly like when the guy delivered it and had to dig through the trash to find the order slip, and that the car absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke. But still, sandwich tastes amazing as always.
