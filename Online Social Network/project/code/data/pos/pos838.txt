HUGE though didn't have pool thermometer. but happy to order it for no extra charge!

Very friendly and helpful. good service in that they call you at least 2x until you pick up your special order. For those of us crazy busy with new baby. rather than just call once and let you have to remember you ordered something.

also didn't have my special garage opener.. had to order that one myself from the internet.
