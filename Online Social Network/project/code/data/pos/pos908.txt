Being a big fan of breakfast food, I had to go here after it was recommended by some locals. I ordered a black coffee and Angie's Famous Melt (Homefries, saut√©ed onions,pepper, ham, smoked sausage, bacon, 2 eggs, any style topped with melted cheese) Let me say this, the portions are huge. My order was enough to satisfy two hungry people. The melt had a little too much potato for my taste(they put a lot ), but overall it was pretty good. The waitress mixed up my request for no ham with my friends and ended up giving me ham and leaving it out of his, however, she noticed this herself right away and asked if I wanted it remade, but it didn't matter enough for me to wait again. 

The food did take a while to prepare (half an hour?), so just based on my experience, I would only go if I had time to sit down and enjoy my food. I also enjoyed the small town diner interior. I think it definitely added some character and charm! As another yelper mentioned it does have a very "homey feel".
