Teri was great. Finally I have a dentist who takes their time with you and wants to do things right because they actually enjoy their job in the healthcare business!! She really does explain everything to you without making you feel dumb, too. The only possible downside is that the appts can be rather lengthy in duration...but hey, that's what you should get for quality treatment.
