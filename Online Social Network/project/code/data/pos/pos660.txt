Great location.  Rooms a bit small but honestly as much space as you need.  We had a spot in the back and didn't hear a peep the whole time.  Kind of old-timey, with charm.  Very organic and environmental-based.  The front desk clerks were really helpful over the phone and email, but a little preoccupied when we physically walked in and out; but they're likely students and probably doing homework- when we said hi they picked their heads up and were always very nice.  We would definitely come back.
