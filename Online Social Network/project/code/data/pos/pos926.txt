One of my most favourite used bookstores ever.  I got a trio of books I've been dying for at less than $6 total (they were between $15-$25 at your standard Barnes & Noble).

They have this hilarious section near the front that is clearly marked SMUT.  It houses a series of risque and totally maddening works from the 1800's (or lower?) to the '50's.  Read about housewives who break the rules!  Or better (maybe worse) still, read The Way of a Man with a Maid, by an anonymous writer explicitly describing his sexual rampage through Victorian society.  Or you can be boring and check out your everyday Marquis de Sade.

I stood under that SMUT sign for, like, the longest.
