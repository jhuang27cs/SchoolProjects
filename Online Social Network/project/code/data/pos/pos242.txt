Every time my dad and I go to berkeley we ALWAYS go to this restaurant.  And I'm sure that Berkeley has many delicious restaurants, but this place is awesomeness on a stick.  Or, in a bowl, I guess.  

The Veggie Delight salad is amazing.  It doesn't even matter what dressing you get--they're all good.  And you can probably just get the salad and share it with a friend.  Seriously.  One veggie delight salad could feed Peru for several months! (although, guinea pig is not on the menu)  And the sammiches are delicious!  the fresh bread is, as every other reviewer has said, thick and tasty.  A bit sweet, but in a good way.    The egg salad is super good, the tofu sammich is alright.  A little sweet.  the turkey is good, standard turkey sammich.  It's just that salad.  Its SERIOUS salad.

Here's the missing star (I almost rated it 5, then thought about it a bit more).... They are often out of egg salad and/or sprouts.  And, I love both egg salad and sprouts.  What can I say, I'm a california girl.  Tables can be scarce--best to figure out what you're ordering before you start standing in line, and come with a friend who can grab the table and hold it for you.  And that's about it.  I don't care  about the tables that much, but it's really really disappointing when all you want is a 1/2 and 1/2 veggie delight and egg salad sammich only to find that neither has sprouts and the sammich can't be egg salad.  Especially when you're coming from Santa Cruz.  Or Sacramento.  Or San Diego.  Then it's a bitter cup of sproutless eggsaladlessness.

P.S. Its super cheap, everything about $7 (with $2 beers, incidentally), but bring cash!! Cash only.
