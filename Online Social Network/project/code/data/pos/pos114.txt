There is something about hot food just off the grill.  I "like* thai food, but not enough to seek it out, and it is often "cold" when it gets to the table, and it never stirs my soul. 

Thai Toms suffers from none of that.  And I am convinced that spoonful of whatever that goes in the wok, is a highly addictive substance.  It may not make you high, but it does something that makes my mouth water every time I want to go there.  

I ALWAYS get the same item.  Chicken Panang.  I also like the little deep fried bullet rolls, and I usually have water.   The reason I get the same thing, is that it is SO good, and I am not even close to sick of it.

No matter how few people there are on the ave, and how empty all the restaurants are, there is ALWAYS a line out of Thai Toms.  Nothing else should recommend it more than that.  

It doesn't matter what day of the week, what time of the day, there is always a line.  Because of that, and the noise of the restaurant this is solely about food, and getting it from the plate, into your gullet, and out the door.   Where unbelievably all you can think about is your next trip back.
