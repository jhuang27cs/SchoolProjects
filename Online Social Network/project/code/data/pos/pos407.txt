As a grocery store, this place is overpriced, narrow and crowded. My five-star review is reserved simply for the best thing you can get here: the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a roll. Best in the city. The eggs are perfectly cooked on the frying surface, you have your choice of cheeses (I prefer cheddar or pepper jack), the bacon isn't over- or undercooked, not too salty, just the right amount of grease. Top with a slice or two of tomato with the perfect amount of sweet and acid, and sandwich between a lightly toasted roll, and then you have the best bacon, egg and cheese on a roll in the city.
