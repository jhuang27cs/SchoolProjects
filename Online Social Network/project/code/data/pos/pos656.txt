So far I've had the grape leaves entre (good, but for the super Real Deal, go to Mama Ayesha's near Adam's Morgan), a gyro, another entre I can't remember, and I shared a feast platter.  I enjoyed all of them.  Mosaic uses all the right spices in all the right places.  Tried the hookah once, too.  It was all right (smoking's not really my thing).  I plan on going back a few more times before I graduate in a few months.
The wait staff is very polite and attentive, as well.  It's nice to have a place like this in College Park!
