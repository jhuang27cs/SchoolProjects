Oh, the Fabulous Fox...how I love thee. From the first time I walked into this gorgeous building...I knew that this would be one of my favorite places in Atlanta. It's hard to put into words how beautiful this theater. I honestly feel, as if, I've stepped back in time whenever I walk through their doors. So many great people/groups have performed here...you can feel that history. 

A few things to note...
* Concessions are pretty good here...variety of food and drinks, as well as two large bars. They also sell coffee drinks, which is a bonus if you have a boyfriend who loves espresso like mine. 
* The ceiling of the theater...there are no words how beautiful it is. It's a beautiful night sky...just lovely. 
* Bathroom lines can tend to be long...so I suggest sneaking out a few moments before intermission to go. 
* The Fox website has a feature when purchasing tickets where you are able to see the actual view of the stage of where your seat will be. It's pretty cool. I honestly don't think there is a bad seat in the house though. I've been close to the stage and far back in the balcony and have enjoyed every show.

I've seen such a variety of shows here. To name a few...Oklahoma, Wicked, Cats, Phantom (traveling Broadway), My Morning Jacket, Widespread Panic, Stomp (musical shows), Alvin Ailey (dance) and a bunch of Atlanta Ballet shows (Nutcracker, Romeo & Juliet, Swan Lake).

Bottom-line - everyone (artists, comedians, dance companies) want to perform on this stage. There's nothing better than that.  

Ok...sometimes ticket prices can be a tad high, but if your resourceful...you can find discounted nights for most shows. Or...you can always go to a matinee...they tend to be lower. 

Overall...if you have never experienced this magical place...I highly suggest to buy tickets for the next show they have. I promise you'll back again soon.
