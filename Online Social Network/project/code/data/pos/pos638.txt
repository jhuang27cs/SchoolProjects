Oh Biba, man oh man, do I like you. I agree with what previous Yelpers have said, you can tell this is a relative of Tria, but it's a little louder, a little cheaper and a little easier to get a seat. Visited Biba last night and was shocked by the crowd on a Tuesday night! Especially with how cold it is....it was packed, but not in a bad way. The space is really cozy, the servers are really nice and the menu is a pared-down Tria menu with a few changes. The four of us had the meat board, a few cheeses, split a panini, salivated over the Tuscan bead spread, had the truffle crostini (salty, but good) and the truffled egg skillet. My husband was pleased by the skillet, even though he was hoping it would be the same as the truffled egg toast at Tria. We spent around 200 bucks, which was a little more than I had planned, but we also drank a lot, ate a lot and had a blast. OH! And there are hooks under the tables for your coats. Love it.
