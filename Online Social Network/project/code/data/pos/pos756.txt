I have been going to this local favorite italian place on Lake in Pasadena for a few years now and they have always been very consistent.  The owner is always there and the staffs are all knowledgeable and friendly.  My favorite meal over there goes like this.. Mozzarella & Tomatoes (Caprise) or Mushroom souffle as appetizer, Squid Ink Spaghetti (it's really way better than it looks or sounds), and the panna cotta for dessert.  We always have a good time there and esp enjoy sitting outside on a nice sunny california day.
