I forgot what we were celebrating but we decided to come to Fleming's Steakhouse. The parking really sucks, I have been to this plaza a few times already and always forget where to walk up from the parking garage. We just sucked it up and paid for Valet because we were almost late for our reservation. The hostess was fantastic, we sat right away, the server was very nice. She answered all our questions and even gave recommendations of wines she likes best with out meat choices. 

We ordered;
-Sear Ahi Tuna with a mustard sauce
-The Wedge Salad
-Petite Filet Mignon
-Prime Ribeye 
Sides
-Grilled Asparagus
- Chipotle Mac'n'Cheese
And we split a bottle of red wine that was so delicious it got me drunk after 1 1/2 glasses....

The dinner was delicious, from the ahi, salad to our steaks. The steaks were both cooked to our preference, by the time the dessert menu came we were both too stuffed. Prices are to be expected expensive but given our experience, definitely worth it. My only complaint was the lighting was a bit too low for me. But that's just me.
