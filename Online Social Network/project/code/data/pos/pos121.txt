Previously I gave this restaurant 5 stars, but I'm bringing it down to a 4. It's gotten too pricey for us! I think it's about $11-14 for a burrito. I know their burritos are great but not *that* great. Also, their steak burritos sometimes have questionable non-meat parts in them. Mostly steak, but some fat/skin. Not a fan. Go for the chicken burrito.
