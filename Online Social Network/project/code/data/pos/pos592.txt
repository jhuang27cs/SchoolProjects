I went to LuLu's dozens of times during my undergrad at CMU.  Basically, it is cheap with decent portions and the food is pretty good if you get the right dish.  Stick to the noodle dishes and you will be good. Most of the time I stuck with the Chow Fun Beef.

Are there better places? Certainly - try Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill.  But for price it is pretty good.
