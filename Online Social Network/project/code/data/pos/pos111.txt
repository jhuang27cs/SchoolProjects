Dr. Schnierow at San Diego Sleep Medicine IS the reason that I sleep now and without the aid of pharmaceuticals. I've struggled with severe insomnia for over 20 years and have been to multiple sleep doctors from Boston to San Diego. Since I don't have a physical problem like sleep apnea most doctors tell me to not watch tv in my room, get out of bed after 20 min, don't drink caffeine etc. I've also tried natural meds, EMDR etc. nothing was working.Dr. Schnierow is the first sleep doctor to "think outside the box" and give me hope that I wasn't going to live my life sleepless. He listened to my story and gave me suggestions that actually worked. Repairing years of insomnia takes time and Dr. Schnierow gives me that time and creativity. Just a side note that at my first appointment with him we got in a discussion where I became frustrated and almost didn't go back. I am so grateful that I did!! I have enjoyed every appointment since and feel like I really have someone looking out for my sleep. Plus, I was able to get in to see him in 1 week vs. 4 months for another sleep specialist in town.If you want a new approach and attitude to your sleep problems go to Dr. Schnierow.
