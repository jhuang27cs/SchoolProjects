If I could give Delfino's a 4.5 I would, but only because they need at least a 2nd private dining space. GROW, DARN IT!!

Their stuffed pizza is some of the best 'za  in Seattle, worth every second of the 35 +/- minutes it takes to prepare. Yes, it'd be nice to have more potential ingredients on the menu, but frankly? As good as the present offering is, who cares? 

WARNING: Unless possessed of uncommon restraint, don't visit more'n every three months or so lest you achieve essentially globular form.

YUM
