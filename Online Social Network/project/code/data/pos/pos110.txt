The only difference between this original spot and the one up the road about 5 blocks on the Drag is the inconvenience. Being located inside Dobie mall, it definitely has a very jail-like feel to it... the lighting in Dobie and even in its dining hall just exerts some odd depressive feeling.

There is something very comforting about VERTS. It offers the same things we know and love: customization of our "deli" style items where we act like we know the best combinations i.e. Subway and lots of meat. And carbs. It is not too ethnic where the sandwich only comes in one fashion. It is just ethnic enough to provide that bit of unique flavor i.e. lamb.

The sauces are assuredly quite good. The spicy red is a creamy zippy one, and the vinaigrette offers a bit more richness than most oil and vinegar types, so as to provide the best dipping for the nooks and crannies found in your kebap. They pile on the goodies to excess, to boot.

I don't know how they are making it in a college town by selling light non-wraps... pita pit has pitas, and which wich has wiches, but Kebap's are their own animal. It almost reminds of a gordita of some sort. Quite good; get here.
