Oh word!

I just got a deep tissue massage for a whopping $53!  

The Early Bird Special is comprised of a 60 minutes Swedish massage for $43, Mon-Fri, 9am - 2pm!  If you get a deep tissue massage, they add on $10 more.  So I paid $53 for a deep tissue massage! 

Eva kneaded out all the knots and kinks in my shoulders and upper back!  She was professional and oh so good!  The place isn't Burke Williams ... but if you're just there for a massage, this place is the way to go!

Awesome massage at a cheap price!  You can't get any better than this!
