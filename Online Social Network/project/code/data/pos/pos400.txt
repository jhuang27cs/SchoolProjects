A bunch of us went to Boston for a conference. After too many talks, a few of us decided to play hooky and go get some hot chocolate. Twenty minutes later, we're sitting at a tiny table in this cute cafe and I'm sipping on the richest and thickest hot chocolate ever. YUM - who needs science when one has chocolate like this? 

I ordered the smallest size possible and it came in a ridiculously small cup. I also got a cookie the size of a quarter (not joking - I actually took out a quarter to compare). I felt like I was a kid again playing with my little toy tea set, except my toy tea set never made chocolate this good.
