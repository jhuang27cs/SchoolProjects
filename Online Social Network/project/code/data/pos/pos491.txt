For years I walked by this place and was like "Man, that is totally a sketchy dive, look at all those hideous glowing beer signs." Then I went in, and my entire attitude changed. Well, kind of. So its still sort of a dive, but that's definitely okay sometimes. Their burgers are really juicy and pretty much the perfect size... nothing amazing, but solid and decent. They have a good variety of beer. The jukebox is full of "oh man, I'm so indie" music, which is um, fine with me!
