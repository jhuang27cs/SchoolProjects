Fabulous food! I've had breakfast and lunch here and everything is delicious! The prices are good too. I want to try their brunch but it is super crowded each time I go there, I Will try going earlier because I think it is worth it!

The only downside to it is that it is a bit small and I don't think they have a good ventilation system because my eyes hurt with the smoke from the kitchen, and the kitchen is not that tidy.

Other than that, it rocks.
