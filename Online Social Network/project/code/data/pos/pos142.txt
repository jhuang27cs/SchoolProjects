Been here THREE times. Tony is the BEST WAITER. Kelly is good TOO!

Recommended COURSE: SPINACH ARTICHOKE. MELTING POT house salad. French quarter or pacific rim. FLAMING TURTLE.

Out of Court Bouillon, Mojo, and Coq Au Vin, I prefer COURT BOUILLON the most.

Bill comes out to be $90 to $120. EXTREMELY romantic. For reservation, request for seating in LOVER's LANE. 

Park in the Marriott bottom floor for that FREE 3 HOUR PARKING (make sure to let your waiter/waitress validate your parking).

They do not serve BREAKFAST or LUNCH. Would COME AGAIN. FONDUE style means essentially dipping your FOOD into a steaming pot with various ingredients.
