I LOVE this restaurant!  Its the place that I go to if I just need to get away from the stress of everything and really just relax.  Not to mention, I love the fact that when I am there, I am the oddity!  Hahah with my tats and dreads, I am sure that they don't see a whole lot of people like me.  So, the entertainment factor is always high for me.

I cant get enough of the southwest Cesar salad with blackened shrimp.  (you have to ask for them to substitute the shrimp in for you otherwise its a breast of chicken)  I eat wayyyy too much chicken, so its nice to have something else for a change.  

The service here is always pleasant, prompt and quick with the drink refills.  I cant say enough.  I know that its difficult to find and parking can be interesting.  But...that is what makes it great.  I love that its off the beaten path.  And the parking....well ehh come on...where in los angeles these days is easy to park?
