Fun, laidback no-frills bar.  A couple of us stumbled on The Field after visiting nearby Four Burgers for our monthly dining club.  Beers were cheap and there was quite a variety on tap.

The best part is there is separate room with a pool table ($1 of quarters is all you need), darts, and flat screen TV.  The bartender was nice and the guy checking IDs entertained my question about the bar's address (we had a friend coming to meet up with us, but I had no idea what street we were even on).  Apparently neither did the bouncer so he stuck his head outside and checked for me!

The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ladies' room which was not in good shape if you know what I mean.  Oh, and tip for the gals -- the light switch is on the outside of the bathroom to the right of the door.  (It took me forever to find it so I thought I would save you the pain.)

I'll definitely be back here to try their grub!
