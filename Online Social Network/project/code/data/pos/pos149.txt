I visited Pasadena for the first time and tried looking for places to eat.. I was hungry and didnt really want to be adventurous so my first meal in Pasadena was Panda Express. The food was good, the employees are nice, and they pack your to-go container with loads of food. The place is bigger than other Panda locations that I've been to so people are not bunched into one little room. I thought it was interesting that they sell beer.. the only place I've seen a Panda Express w/ beer was in Vegas. Parking is plentiful, but can be difficult during lunch time since the whole lot is shared by a handful of other stores.
