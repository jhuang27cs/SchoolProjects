Cedars and Taste of India are definitely the better Indian restaurants in the U-district. We are vegetarians and this review is for their vegetarian entrees and appetizers only. Cedars has parking and nice window-side tables that overlook the street. 

The tables are very small - especially since their naan is HUGE. Very flavorful and fluffy naan and chutneys (sauces that go along with it). The staff is super friendly and accommodating. I once ordered around 2 entrees when my family was visiting and requested them to give me something in place of the rice (we are not big fans of rice) And they were nice enough to give us a plain naan in its place. The dishes are yummy and desserts are tasty, the Dal soup is one of the best I have had. 

But again, the food gets boring after a time - India has a lot of different cuisines and Seattle has restaurants that mostly serve North Indian or Punjabi dishes only. Perhaps if there were more variety, I would enjoy eating here more. But the truth is, naan-rice and gravy combo from here or Taste of India or Jewel of India or Garam Masala etc., taste the same to me. Very generic curry. I can't wait to go to the bay area each time to experience REAL variety in Indian food.

Like Taste of India, Cedars has unlimited Chai too. But beware! It is very sweet. the portions are generous too. It sometimes gets so cold here. I noticed that they now have portable heaters in the rooms. Definitely a welcome change!
