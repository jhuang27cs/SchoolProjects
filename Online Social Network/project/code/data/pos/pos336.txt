This is the best of all worlds:  Great food in the store and other great places just around the corner.   Toscano's is an inexpensive yet delicious sandwich shop with awsome Italian food market included.  Grab some pesto and pasta for your late evening snacking pleasure.  They have an excellent selection of packaged foods from Italy that are difficult to find elsewhere.  They also have refridergerators and freezers with prepared foods that are made in house.  If you like the sandwichs then you will not be disappointed with these items.  Also, great selection of Italian wines.  While the selection is limited in quanitiy, the selections are of a dependable high quality with resonalbe prices, like starting below $10.

Following your soup and sandwich fare, HOP two doors down to the best craft beer store in town, "HopCity" where you can experience the best beer selection in town (both bottled and draft to go, ergo "growler"). 

It's interesting how a business like Toscano & Sons EXCEEDS at providing a delightful experience that is a complete VALUE.
