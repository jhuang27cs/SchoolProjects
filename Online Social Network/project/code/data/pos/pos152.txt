I have only been here for dinner, I have never had the buffet.  All of my experiences have been positive so far.

I usually order the coconut curry chicken with the basil and garlic naan bread - it's AMAZING.  The rice is seasoned with fresh ingredients; last time, the rice even had whole cinammon sticks in it!  

I would eat here more often if it weren't so expensive.  However, if you are a UT student, there is usually a coupon on the web for a buy one entree and get the second half off...that way the prices are more reasonable as long as you bring a friend/date.

GET THIS - last time I went, I accidently left my credit card with the bill.  The waitress was kind enough to come running after me (yes, she even crossed Guadalupe during rush hour) to stop me and return the card before I got into my car!!!  Extra karma points for her.
