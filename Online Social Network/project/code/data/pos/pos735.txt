I've been dreaming about this place for the last week so I figured I'd write a review about my last trip a month ago. I hate the term gastropub because it's usually code for over-priced menu with fancy decorations and sub-par food, so I refuse to group this place into that category. This place rocks from the dive bar look to the beer selection to the Mac-n-cheese. If you love beer , this place will easily become one of your favorites in the Boston area. 

Food is interesting, fresh and always tasty. Service has always been attentive and helpful. We're familiar with most of the beers on draft but they've been helpful with some friends who know nothing about beer. 

If your thinking about popping your Hobo cherry, don't be scared by the rather plain exterior. Inside the large red curtain this place is clean and neat. Just be warned it can get a little crowded standing around the bar. After our first trip we decided to try the food because it looked so good and the whole experience was better sitting at a table. 

The only Bad thing I can think of here is the parking situation. It's a little bit of a hike from the T and most of the parking is permit only. Since I don't live in Cambridge this has been a little frustrating but I don't see anything the Hobo crew can do about that.
