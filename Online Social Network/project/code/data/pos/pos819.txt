Oddly, I've been to Chano's twice now, and I didn't even attend USC. The first time was in 2004 when I was visiting my friend Kaitlyn, and she suggested that my other friend and I grab some Chano's breakfast burritos for the drive back to NorCal. Don't let the meager price of these breakfast burritos fool you! I ordered two thinking they would be small, and couldn't manage eating both during our 6-hour drive! Eggs, beans, ham, cheese, all rolled up into a flour tortilla. Mmmm... 
The second time was post-bonfire with another SC-alum friend when I ordered a Machaca burrito, which I'll have to admit did not live up to the Chano's that I remember. It was tasty enough, but not nearly as filling. But for 5 bucks? I'll go back, for sure. Three stars for the food, as it's clearly not the most amazing Mexican food, but five stars for the price, and the novelty of the ghetto-ass drive-thru. Honestly, who makes you pay on the right hand side of the car?! Where are we, England?
