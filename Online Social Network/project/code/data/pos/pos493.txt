The stuffed spinach pizza is so good that I crave it all of the time.  I now live in San Diego and find it hard being so far from Del Fino's.  The pizza's so good that on my last rip to BC, Canada I even scheduled a long layover in Seattle, rented a car, and got my fixing of the pie before my second leg of the flight.  Love it!
