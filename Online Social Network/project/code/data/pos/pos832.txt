I really really really loved this trail. It's very quiet, very nice trail, a lot of vegetation, next to the river, easy to park, and beautiful views. The only think that I don't like too much is that it doesn't loop around so you have to walk back the same way to get your car. I also wish they would allow bikes in the whole trail because it would be an amazing place for biking as well....
