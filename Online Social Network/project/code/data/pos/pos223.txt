Wow. All these food critics aren't kidding when they say the egg salad sandwich at Euro Pane is one of the best around (it was featured on Jonathan Gold's list of things to eat in LA before you die, and also on the Food Network's "Best Thing I Ever Ate"). It really is a seriously kick-ass sandwich.

Now, listen folks. I love egg salad. A lot. In all of its many forms. But there's something about the egg salad at Euro Pane that puts it high above the rest. Most versions of egg salad that I've seen in my day are wet cement-like (albeit delicious) concoctions of diced hard boiled eggs held together with tons of mayo. The eggs in Euro Pane's salad are only medium boiled, giving the yolks a runnier consistency, and cut into larger chunks rather than diced or mashed. As a result, the integrity of the egg itself is kept in tact and you can really savor the egg flavor, rather than the mayo-heavy taste you get from most other versions. Add a squirt of lemon juice and some arugala on top of a couple of slices of sourdough and you've got one awesome sandwich.

The egg salad alone deserves 5 stars but there are some misses here. My dining partner ordered the roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich which was way too heavy on the peppers and, as a result, significantly less satisfying. Also, the oft-discussed macarons were tasty enough and came in a nice assortment of flavors, but the filling could be creamier. There are better macarons out there (make a trip to NY or Vegas to visit Bouchon Bakery and see for yourself).
