If you haven't been to Blakes for food for awhile, go back. They have revamped the menu to make it much for manageable to be able to make some decent food decisions. Their menu used to be just so freakin' big, it was impossible for me to choose. It was unwieldy, I tell ya.

I had an incredible salad and my bf had a burger. Where else can you get a Niman Ranch burger for under $7? You're not gonna get that at Barney's....

Our service was spot-on and attentive. 

It looks like they've done some interior upgrades to  the main floor. Nice touches throughout. I'll be back.
