Went to see William santana after a recommend from a friend. He did a really good job with my brown hair, taking it to a natural looking blonde. He did a whole head of highlights blending in my natural color with two other shades of blonde. The results were very natural and pretty and my sensitive scalp was never subject to burning from harsh chemicals. Go see William if you want good color at a reasonable price. He's worth it.
