Like the place.  Sweet little store. Sweet staff. Nice location.  Cakes are the same size as Kick-ass, but not as crunchy (and seeing as cupcakes should not be crunchy, this is a very good thing)

Unfortunately a lot is like Kick-Ass. (same price, same pupcakes, same cappuccino and double chocolate, same lack of red velvet)

But the cakes are moist, the frosting is fluffy, and the fondant decorations are tasty and fun.

Plus- on the way out, I walked into the Fashion Forward Super-Duo, Morgan and Tyler, headed to Sweet.  Anyplace with that kind of clientele has automatic style points.

This is the only place I have been too where the Carrot Cake has wowed me. I liked it even better than the chocolate, which says A LOT
