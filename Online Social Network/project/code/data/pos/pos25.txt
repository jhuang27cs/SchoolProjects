Incredibly friendly and helpful staff! I'm a shy person, especially being a guy at a beauty / medical spa, but they make me feel just comfortable. 

I came here because of the Yelp reviews (Thanks, yelp!) 
Anna (front desk) is polite and helpful. I just don't talk alot because again i'm generally a quiet person.
Decor is adorable, very cute (and lots of white paint).

They have packages + promos from time to time that are worth checking out.
Thanks Elude!
