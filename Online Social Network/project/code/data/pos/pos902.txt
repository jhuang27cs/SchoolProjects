Stopped by this store to get a quote for re-heeling my black boots. A nice Korean gentleman quoted me $15 and told me he could have them done in 10 minutes! Great! I sat down, took off my boots, and read an article while my shoes were repaired. All in all, service is fast, friendly, and well done. He even gave my boots a quick polish.
