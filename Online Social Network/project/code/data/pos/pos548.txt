Saving the best review for last! My friend Brandon wanted to take me to this place for a while now. Since my birthday just passed last weekend, we celebrated with sushi for dinner! Arriving fairly early, around 6pm, the restaurant was already filling up. A small quaint little sushi restaurant with one sushi chef behind a small kitchen bar and a couple of waitresses tended to each section. 

We started off with a hijiki and watercress salad, then miso soup, and moved on to a sashimi platter deluxe. The fish was cut perfectly and came with a few extra pieces then the 2 pieces per fish listed on the menu. I was happy with that. The tuna was Blue Fin, and the salmon was more like salmon belly? All of it was fresh. I'm not a big Uni fan, but I still managed to take a piece and enjoy it. We also shared one giant roll. The Rainbow Roll. It consists of tuna, salmon, lobster salad and avocado? It was so big and if I ordered it for myself, I probably would not even be able to finish half of it. 10 HUGE pieces. It should be called a Monster Roll eh?

The staff was really friendly. Had to ask for the green tea to be refilled, but thats ok. If this is the best place for sushi in Princeton, I believe it!

NO RESERVATIONS! Come early, long wait on weekends during peak hours.
