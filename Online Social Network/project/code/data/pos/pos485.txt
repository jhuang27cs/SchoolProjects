Fantastic food, but be prepared to wait because this place is very popular (even their Saugus location gets busy Thurs/Fri/Sat evenings).

Specialized in Tex-Mex and Cajun dishes.  The guacamole, chips and salsa are REALLY GOOD and margaritas are decent.

Quesadillas are gigantic and hearty.  Blackened catfish is a must-try for anyone who likes things spicy.  Crawfish etouffee is also perfectly spicy and hearty on the crawfish.

Also has many good options for vegetarians.

Don't expect to find authentic Mexican food here, but what they make is a tasty Americanized version with good flavor.  Their Cajun style dishes are outstanding.

Open late!
