I never knew about this place though I've walked past it at least a dozen times before, and it's very easy to miss up above the streets. Inkstone is deceptively small, as they carry a ton of great things, at pretty average/reasonable prices. The staff is very laid-back and never in-your-face about selling you products or has gimmicky crap around to confuse you. 
I love the weird prints they have in the back of the store - found a human body circulation chart for a few dollars and I was thrilled the other day. They also sell loose-leaf sheets of bristol, illustration board, watercolor paper, etc. which a lot of places surprisingly don't do. Good selection of pens for the ink enthusiasts like me who can't stand their Bic's, and some good sets in the front (glass case) as well. 
I also came in here to print a report for a class and it literally took something like 10 seconds to print. 
Overall a gem. I'm coming back.
