This was definitely a good call by my man to try this place out for dinner!  

We started out with very courteous service, and were seated in the back patio atrium area - very cute.  I always love a natural light lit patio that has air conditioning, especially in the summer.

We ordered a bottle of wine, and it was really very good - I think I've found a new Malbec to love.  When we asked about which dish was better, we got an immediate non hesitant answer (just what I like to hear), so we placed our orders and enjoyed the ambiance in the meantime.

The food came out - and I really did like the lasagna.  The sauce was excellent, and tasted like it was made of fresh tomatoes. It was almost a tad too cheesy for me, but it was so good overall that it worked out really well.  We also ordered the Chicken Marsala - which for me, I always did not like - and it was REALLY good.  I think my distaste for the dish had to do with me tasting one that didn't have a good sauce.. so this place has opened up a whole new realm of Italian dishes for me.  Definitely had a good time!
