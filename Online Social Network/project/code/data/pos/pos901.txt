My favorites:

- toasted english muffin with butter, no jam. there's no need for jam. the muffins are so tender and yummy, especially when warm and buttery.

- spinach salad with sliced almonds, mandarin orange, sliced strawberries. goat cheese (with added grilled chicken breast) and homemade (it seems homemade to me) balsamic dressing of some kind. the dressing is AMAZING. sweet, with poppy seeds, tart, rich. it goes perfectly with the goat cheese and oranges and strawberries. and chicken. actually, i must confess that i prefer to sop up the leftover dressing with my toasted, buttered english muffin. way better than any jam. it's like a meal and dessert all in one. SO GOOD!!

- quiche! So good! so far i've had two kinds: 1) mushroom and caramelized onion, 2) sweet potato, corn, and feta. the mushroom might have been my favorite. amazing with fresh herbs (i think thyme? or sage?)

coffee's good.
$ is good.
service is good.
food is great.

basically, this is my new favorite spot in harvard square.
