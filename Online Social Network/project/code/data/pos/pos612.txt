Fifteen of my coworkers and I descended upon the new Han Dynasty location for lunch on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend. The place was about half-full; we only had to wait a few minutes for the servers to push some tables together for our group. We had no reservation, but they treated us like VIPs, anyway.

I was finally able to try the Dan Dan noodles because we split two bowls around the table. I would highly recommend trying that. They were happy to hold the pork from one of the bowls, for the vegetarians among us, and the noodles were quite tasty and spicy on their own. I also sampled the spicy crispy cucumbers (great), the scallion pancake (fantastic, but still not as good as my Chinese friend's dad makes them), and the lunch portion of the bok choy with a delightful chewy mushroom. It's nice that you can get most of the entrees as lunch portions for a fraction of the price at the lunch hour. I'm thrilled that we have such a fantastic Chinese option in University City!
