Thought I'd contribute my review as a grad of GSAS, French Cultural Studies MA program. The program was a really small, intimate group of 12 and classes are conducted in French in Paris at the Reid Hall campus (with mandatory classes taken in French universities). 

For anyone considering this program here are my thoughts.

Pros:
-In Paris
-Takes three semesters for the MA; from Sept Y1-Oct Y2
-Small class size, students are well vetted and you really feel like you are among your academic peers
-Some of CU's, France's and the UK's best and brightest (and well published) profs 
-Campus is small but beautiful and has many a quiet area for study
-Semester three is all about writing the thesis; there are no classes (even though you pay for the semester, so this could maybe be a con) so you could conceivably get a job and/or travel while writing
-Very nice/helpful administrative staff at Reid Hall

Cons:
-Very literature focused for a "cultural studies" program; this could have something to do with the French view of cultural studies, but as a sociologist, it was frustrating to have to keep explaining what I wanted to write my thesis on and to fight for a thesis advisor that was not a literature professor, but (in my case) an urban sociologist
-The dean is pretty hands off, so look elsewhere if you encounter problems
-There's not a ton of special financial aid (one merit scholarship, based on French language skills, I believe), but it's only three semesters 
-Had some difficulty with the guy who has the racket on housing, but after complaining (a lot) I was moved to another apartment after 6 weeks

If you do decide to do the program, I would recommend looking into the CAF (aid the French gov. at least used to provide for all students, even foreigners); getting an apartment on your own to avoid the overhead of the guy who's in charge of the apartments (it's not as hard as it sounds; the entire city basically illegally sublets with little problems); and if you plan to work at all, you can plan around knowing that semester three has no classes just the thesis to write.
