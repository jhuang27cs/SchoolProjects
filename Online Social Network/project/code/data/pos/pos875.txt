i got a groupon deal for this and i knew i'd have a chance to be around the area - so i wanted to give it a try! 

when i first pulled up, i was a little hesitate because it's basically a residential house - looks like the owner for the lot just decided to turn this residential land into some business? i think i recall seeing a dentist office at the back 'the back house'...

after i stepped in though i feel much better, the calming music, the scents and the warm welcome from the girls. the wax was done pretty fast and painless - she tried to make small talks with you too to drive away your attention.

would recommend - especially if you see any more deals!
