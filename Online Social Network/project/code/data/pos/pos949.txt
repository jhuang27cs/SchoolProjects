Definately the BEST food that I have had uptown! I wish I had found this earlier. Apparantly, it is only when I decide to move OUT of Harlem that I find something good nearby.

Not only was the food not horrible overpriced (like the rest of the UWS), it was GOOD!! I find most everything here to be either poor quality or horribly bland. Pisticci was neither.

We started with the mussels in tomato-basil broth. It was light, and the mussels were large, meaty, and flavorful. To top it off, the texture was perfect. Not stringy or overcooked in the slightest.

For entrees, we both got specials. The cavatelli with veal ragu was hearty and heavy just like I wanted. The pasta was thick and held up well to the sauce (and even reheated quite well for breakfast this morning, since I cold only finish half of it). The linguini (?) with crab and spinich was light, and great to start spring. The sauce didn't overpower the crab at all. Well done!

The desserts were OK. The pineapple cake was good. The frangelico chocolate mousse was fine, but I couldn't taste any hint of frangelico. I think it's sad when a restaurant serves up desserts that aren't as good as the food, since it is the note that finishes the night. But then again, the food was really good. 

The only warning I would give is that the specials are much more expensive than the listed entrees and pasta dishes (but stll are pretty inexpensive for what you get). The main entrees range from $9.99 to around 15. Our specials were $18 and $21. Not bank-breaking, but you should probably ask before ordering.
