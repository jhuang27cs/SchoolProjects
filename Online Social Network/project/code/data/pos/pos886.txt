Coming here is like being a part of a secret society, you gotta be in the know (even to find the entrance!)  Went here for a group dinner a while back and it was pretty good - great value and everyone is eager to please.  

You can see the kitchen from pretty much wherever you are so if you really want to keep an eye on the staff you can (but that would be creepy).  

Great food and great prices - try it out (if you can find it!)
