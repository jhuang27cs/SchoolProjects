Three months ago I found Dentistry for Life... The dental office that I went to over two years ago was not friendly and I did not feel comfortable going back. I can tell you that once you step through the door into this office, you will receive the utmost care any dental office can give - from the family atmosphere to the exceptional care that Dr. Dubin provides.
