This place has aspirations! The the big curtained entrance, the dim, exotic, romantic decor, and the dish presentation remind me of a few haute cuisine restaurants in Boston and Cambridge. It's nice to have atmospheric restaurants in Amherst.

I liked my Chelo Vegetarian. It was a good value for the price in my opinion, It came with grape leaves, falafels on hummus, pita, basmati rice and Persian salad.  The grape leaves were a little over-marinated for my liking, but the falafel, hummus and basmati rice were perfect. My friend ordered a really tasty lamb stew that I will have to get for myself next time. The salad was a pretty standard minced tomato, red onion, cucumber, black pepper and lemon juice mix

No problem with service, though that was perhaps because we came for an early dinner at an off hour (there was only one other table when we came in). Our waitress seated us promptly and offered us samples of their homemade rose tea. My friend wasn't sure about ordering a dish she'd never tried before, and the waitress offered to take it back if she didn't like it, which I thought was kind. 

The rest of the menu looked great, and I'll certainly be back for kebobs and lava cake!
