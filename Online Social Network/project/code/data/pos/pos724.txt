Apparently I should never take my non-veg friends here?

I used to eat here all the time when I was in grad school (04-06), but once I graduated it seemed like such a hike to get over there and I could never find anyone that wanted to go with me. Slowly it completely faded off my radar. Until today when I was driving by at dinner time. 

So many vegan options! I had remembered I liked the protein 2000, but that it was a little too heavy to eat very much of. I also remembered I loved their tofu eggplant dish. But then when I was looking at the menu, I remembered, oh yeah! I love the lucky seven too, and the steam buns, and the five stars, and the boba! So good and so affordable! Yes the menu is mostly fried chewy salty things. This is not the place to go for fresh and healthy.

I haven't ever had a problem with rude staff or seen anything super nasty/dirty. It's not fancy, but it's not any worse than something like Firebowl or McDonald's, and the prices are as cheap and the food is better.
