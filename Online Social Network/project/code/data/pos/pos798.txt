Perfect night out.. 

Appetizers: boneless buffalo wings with blue cheese, nachos, and calamari. The Calamari had a mexican food twist to it almost. The nacho's were so good that I saw them on another table walking in and decided to order them.

I had the blonde beer and then the buffalo buffalo wing salad. So yummy and perfectly spiced for me, which means mild but I was sweating. 

I would def go there again if I was in the hood. 6 of us ate, drank and got aps for $160, not too shabby.
