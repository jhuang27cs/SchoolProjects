The Gods have answered my prayers: I can now get coffee from somewhere other than Starbucks!  This place is good, though not as awesome as the center city location.  The service is friendly, the chocolate is great (try the Bangkok), the coffee is great (my server had insight on the fact that Starbucks burns their coffee; good sign!), cupcakes are something to return for, and the hot chocolates (European style only plz) will coat your throat for the entire day.  2 thumbs up!
