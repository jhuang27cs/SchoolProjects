Yeah, I came here to get my nose, cartilage, eyebrow, and lip pierced.. Just kidding. I came here to get my EARS pierced as an adult past drinking age. So brave, ha!

I had been avoiding ever getting my ears pierced since I was horrified from hearing stories about Claire's as a kid (bad infections, lopsided piercing, teenage min. wages employees surreptitiously armed with a gun). Then on one cool spring day, I decided that it was finally time to get my ears pierced.

The lady who helped me was very experienced, nice, and informative the entire time. She was nice enough to bear with my babbling. The piercing part didn't hurt. I was given good directions on how to care for it. My ears are good. No infections. 

The name of this place is hilarious--but no regrets indeed.
