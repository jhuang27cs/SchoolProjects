THE BEST LATE NIGHT FOOD IN ALL OF CAMBRIDGE!

Falafel Palace delivers consistently every time. Before you assume your experience is going to be perfect, beware of the following:
- Long lines, especially around 2am
- Juicy, drippy falafel wraps
- No space inside to eat

If you're prepared to endure those hardships, then you're ready for:
- Amazing, quality falafel (I've been to Israel twice, I know my falafel)
- If you ask for extra anything (I highly recommend pickles), you will get an abundance of that item
- LOTS OF FOOD for CHEAAAP
- Homemade baklava
- If you ask for spicy, you're going to burn your mouth

For a while I only ordered the falafel wrap with tahini sauce and extra pickles, but the other day I branched out and got the vegetarian plate (which is a healthier option). I have never been disappointed at Falafel Palace. The owners are awesome, too.
