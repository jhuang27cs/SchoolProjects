Dr. Ghosh has been my primary care doc for roughly the last three years. As others have mentioned, he's very health maintenance oriented, caring, and is always willing to spend the time to explain not only the "what" but also the "how, why, or why not" of various treatments/procedures. When I've inquired about various therapies, he's always able to cite recent research as the basis for his recommendations rather than the typical "because I say so" of some MD's.

He's by far the best primary care physician I've ever had and I'd highly recommend him to anyone.
