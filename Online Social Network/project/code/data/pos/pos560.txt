Stan's a real class act. We live in Louisiana.  By telephone, from here, we ordered our UCLA student (son) a big batch of his favorite doughnuts from Stan - very late - on our son's birthday. Even though Stan hadn't met us, he agreed to deliver - today, on his birthday - our last minute order to our son's dorm. And, Stan trusted us to pay him by check.

The doughnuts are great and Stan's even greater. Even by Cajun standards, that's real hospitality!  Bon Appetit!
