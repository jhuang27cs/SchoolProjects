Essentials is located in the Doubletree Hotel complex in Claremont.  I am fussy about my spa experiences, and Essentials nearly always meets my standards.  It is clean, the staff is pleasant and attentive, and the quality of the service is high.  The salon area is bright and cheerful, with windows facing the hotel pool.  There is none of the chaos or between-stylists chatter that one often finds in salons.  Instead, Essentials does a great job of hiring technicians who are very client-focused.  The support staff is equally pleasant and professional, greeting visitors by name and offering beverages. There is very little staff turnover, which tells me that the management hires with care and supports the team.  The spa areas are clean, quiet and dimly lit, very relaxing for massages and other private services.
