For the grand finale of my LA trip, we head over to Firestone Grill immediately after Splash Cafe.

I like this place for many reasons.  Obviously the tri-tip sandwich was just off da hook delicious even after clam chowder & calamari literally 5 mins ago.  I also think this is one of the largest, most laid back sports bar/grills I've been to.  The ladies at the register and the bartenders were very friendly in answering my questions.  There is a large dining area inside and the humongous patio outside, but I don't doubt that people may end up spilling onto the sidewalk during game days as it was already quite packed for a Sunday evening.  Despite the noise factor, I felt there was good energy from everyone and I was pretty comfortable.  They have plenty of wide screen LCD TVs hung along the walls for your viewing pleasure (and the picture is clear :P).  I don't think they have servers so you have to walk up to the counter or bar for service.  Not a big deal to me IMO.  

Some might say that it was premature to give this a 5 star rating, but I have faith that the next time I visit (and I will go back), I will not be disappointed.
