Do you ever have a place that you walk by all the time, literally hundreds of times, but never go in?  Well, that was this restaurant situated conveniently between BART and Berkeley campus.  Finally, my friend Jonathan and I popped in for an early dinner and actually had a really tasty meal.

I had a great chicken koobideh kabob (saffron chicken) with saffron rice...do you sense a theme?  Of course, one can never get too much saffron.  The chicken was moist, delicious, tender (this sounds like chicken porn).  Jonathan's lamb was maybe even better.  I wouldn't have minded some veggies thrown in the mix though.  

One big plus was the wine by the glass.  It was actually a generous pour.  I hate the restaurants that think a bottle of wine equates to 15 glasses.  A little odd is the flat bread and butter they serve as a starter.  Maybe with some hummus instead.  All in all it was pleasant, although I can't really give them any points for value.

What is an "Alborz" anyway?  Well, if you google, it looks like the name of lots and lots of Persian restaurants.  Now if you google even more you discover it's a mountain range in northern Iran.  And now you can try to impress your server when you come.
