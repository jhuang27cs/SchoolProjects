I went to Cafe Luna with 3 others for a late lunch (3pm) on a sunny Sunday afternoon.  The person taking names wrote ours town and insured us that he would find us on the tables nearby.  However, after 20 minutes, we went to check in with him and he claimed he had called our name already.  Well, we weren't far and we definitely didn't hear a thing.  Luckily he seated us right away.  

The food was INCREDIBLE.  So many delicious and unique options.  1 page of specials, another page of awesomeness, and I didn't even look at the regular menu.  I got the S'Mac and Cheese (spicy mac and cheese with bacon) and it was amazing.  Others got unique omelets that were great.  Another person got the lemon ricotta pancakes which were to die for.  All in all, food was fantastic.  

The only downfalls come from the service- waitstaff was REALLLLLLLY slow and not super responsive to refills.  Coffees came at all different times and it took awhile to get condiments, etc.  Also, $$$$ but worth the money in my opinion.  Not looking forward to cooler weather when this place gets packed and has no outdoor seating!!
