For a classy restaurant the waitress we got was a bit subpar. Some rich looking old couple sitting next to us (meaning 50 year old with boob job and plastic surgery to look 40 again with a 70 year old man on her arm) got all the attention in the world like they were celebrities whole NOT ONCE did out waitress ask us if our food was okay or if we needed anything. Also during while taking our order I was deciding to order a starter but she cut me off mid sentence and walked away. WTF!!  After our meal, we kindly asked the waitress what was up with her and if we offended her for some reason and she apologized profusely and immediately got the manager to come to our table and he ended up giving us coupons to the new restaurant next door, Local Foods.  Poor waitress, I think she was just having an off day that day.

Other than that mishap, the brunch is good with amazing complimentary muffins and the blood orange mimosas are definitely unique compared to other brunch places that just serve normal mimosas.
