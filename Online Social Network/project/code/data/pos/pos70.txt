I travel during the week for work and get home late Thursday evenings, and I always get takeout somewhere on the way home. This is my go-to stop for takeout because the food is good, it is quick and convenient, and the prices are fair. While the food doesn't blow you away, the quality and spiciness are both consistent (with spiciness based on a 1-to-10 scale), which is hard to find here in Pittsburgh at many Thai restaurants. Also, in my experiences dining in here, the waitstaff has always been very friendly and attentive. My favorite thing to order is the Kiew Wan with chicken and the Mangoes with Sticky Rice for dessert!
