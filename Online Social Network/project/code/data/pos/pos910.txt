I love Carrie. I know many people who get their haircuts here and for good reason. 

Carrie has a delightful personality and she is very good with the scissors. My daughters get their haircuts here, too, and they always love the result. Carrie is creative and listens well to what an individual wants. She will try new things if you like, but also will stick to plan. 

I like that there's a place in town for Aveda hair products again. 

So far, I haven't tried any of their other services, but I am scheduled for color soon.
