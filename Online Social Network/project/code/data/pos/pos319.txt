A fantastic little record store, hidden in the basement of Autumn Leaves. I know better than to go down there unless I have at least an hour and $50 to spare, because I always find what I'm looking for and then some.

They have a very broad selection, and their jazz section is especially great. While the new releases are a little on the pricey side, I don't mind paying those higher prices, because I think it helps them to keep their used prices very reasonable. I've never bought a used record there that I felt was overpriced once I got it home and listened to it. 

The guys are very friendly and knowledgeable, both about music and about how to take care of records. They don't mind if you browse for a long time, and they have listening stations set up where you can try out used records before you buy them. 

They participate in National Record Store Day promotions, and they have a great selection of even the rarest releases on that day. This is also a great place to pick up tickets for all non-State Theater Dan Smalls Presents shows, since there's no service charge on them.

If you're a vinyl lover like I am, make sure to check this place out when you're in Ithaca!
