I came here with my sister-in-law for pre-wedding mani/pedis.  There was a group of about 6 of us, including an 8 year old.  We had made appointments and they were pretty good about getting us all done in a reasonable amount of time.  There was a lot of staff and all 8-10 pedi chairs were full and people were working hard.  My only complaint was they didn't put us all near each other in the pedi chairs so it was a bit awkward.

The pedicure lasted quite a long time and was great.  The manicure lasted an average amount of time, but I'm terrible about chipping my nails.  Their prices were reasonable and it seemed like coupons were easy to come by.  The place was very clean and well maintained.
