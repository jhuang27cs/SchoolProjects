The Garment District and its counterpart Dollar a pound are great places to find unique clothes. I shop there almost exclusively now for clothes because you can't get such stylish or interesting things for under $100 anymore.  Sadly everytime I go there I end up with another tailored dress from the 1950's.   I just can't resist.

It's a huge warehouse of used things where you have to hunt around for hours but when you find something you want it's usually pretty well priced. A month ago I browsed dollar a pound and found 3 high end designer skirts, 2 of which were sink so they cost almost nothing (pricing is by the pound). Just because most of the stuff in dollar a pound is gross does NOT mean that you can't find good stuff there occassionally (the items at dollar a pound are there because they either weren't nice enough to consign or because the former owners did not want to bother with it). 

Anyways, every since I've been in cambridge the prices there have been going up and up.  If you are used to thrift shopping somewhere else the price tags might throw you for a loop.  Don't expect to find any upstairs for less than $7.00.
