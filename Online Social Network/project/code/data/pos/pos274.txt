Are you drunk? Is it around 3am? Are you in downtown Berkeley? Well then, you better head down to Top Dog, purveyor of quality dogs to drunken students for many a year. They have around, what, 25, 30 different kinds of meat dogs, and exactly 1 kind of veggie dog, called the "weenie". When I was there one time with my vegetarian friend, he naturally ordered the veggie option. When it was done, the owner shouts out: "One weenie, who's got the weenie here?" 40 drunken college students couldn't have been happier. Aah, the old ones are the best ones.
