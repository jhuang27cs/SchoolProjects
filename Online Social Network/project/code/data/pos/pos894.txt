One of my frequented spots on the Ave. Looking something a little different than pho and a bit more personalized? Well here you are. I like to order the #5 (comes with some meat, an hard boiled egg, naruto slices and bamboo shoots). The best part is that you can add extra noodles, and assorted extras like the stuff that comes with your meal.

Not a ramen sort of person? I have personally never tried any of the other dishes, but my boyfriend has enjoyed the gyoza and I often see people eating those dishes.
