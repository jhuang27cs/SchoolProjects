I was setting Mint Julep up to be my 200th review but accidentally yelped a generic Adams Morgan bar instead!  Shame on me.

Actually, shame on me for my initial assumptions that this lovely, locally-owned boutique's high prices and Harvard Square location meant that it catered to undergrads wielding Daddy's credit card in shopping sprees and scorned those who show up in sweatpants.  The high-quality clothing and high-quality staff make it a milestone-review-worthy place.

Rachel (the girl with the glasses and light brown hair) knows her shizzle.  She helped me pick out a red Tano clutch and black Kenzie jacket a few months ago, being very patient as I tried on about ten jackets and put the contents of my purse in every single clutch in the store to test out their capacity.  I wish I'd taken her advice to buy a lovely gray Milly dress too--its cost per wear would have been well worth the splurge.   

I purposely ended my hour-long run here last Saturday to peruse the selection of Tano bags, and Rachel helped me out again.  Like porridge to Goldilocks, the bags were all high-quality but not quite right.  Rachel didn't push me to buy any bag that wasn't the equivalent to baby-bear porridge.  She even called Tano to see if they had any grape or avocado bags--unfortunately, they didn't but I still appreciate the effort.  I'll definitely be back for helpful advice and good shopportunity finds!
