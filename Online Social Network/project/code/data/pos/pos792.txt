My husband and I have been oogling this place from afar for a few months now and last night we finally gave in a went. We were pleasantly surprised by the whole thing. It was very busy, but the atmosphere was nice and we got a table right away. The waitstaff was helpful and attentive and we were able to order and get our food quickly despite that restaurant being very busy. The ordering process was similar to a sushi bar in which you fill out a piece of paper on what you want on your burger ranging from type of meat, toppings, sauces and sides. We were both anticipating enormous portions, but were pleasantly surprised by the "normal" food portion that came out. My burger was delicious and so was the coleslaw I ordered on the side. We were also there in time to hear some music from a live DJ. He was spinning clever hip hop/dance remixes using Al Green and Pete Rock and CL Smooth tracks. Brought me back to my high school years. Yum.
