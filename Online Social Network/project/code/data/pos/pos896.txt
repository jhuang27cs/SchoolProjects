The sales staff seem to have more knowledge than other Audi Dealers in So Cal. that I have dealt with. The sales staff really try to do their best before, during and after the sale. Ricky was the person who worked with me and he really has a lot of knowledge of the vehicles. These cars have a lot of electronics and there is a lot to learn! We will see how it goes once I have to deal with service.
