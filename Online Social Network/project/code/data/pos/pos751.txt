These are the best wings you're going to find in LA. The Original or Cajun are the only flavors worth getting. The others are fun, but not as good. It is not possible to eat Atomic wings. 

As for long waits, I've never had a problem. Of course they cook them when you order so it always takes "14 minutes." Just call ahead or order online and you'll never have a problem.

They also have awesome fries.

This is the best food for watching football or basketball :)
