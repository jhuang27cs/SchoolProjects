This may be the last survivor of old downtown Ann Arbor. Somehow it still stands among the upscale bars, coffee shops, restaurants, condos, and galleries. 

Vogel's (at least last time I walked by) was still doing normal small-town work -- the display window was full of locks and keys. Does it miss the toy stores, mom-and-pop department stores, family shoe stores, work-clothes stores, kid's clothing stores, dress shops, diners, and other businesses that the 21st century has made so obsolete?

I don't mourn the fate of complacent shop owners who let themselves be left behind when rents rose and the world changed. You can't fight the whole economy and globalism. But I do admire this survivor.
