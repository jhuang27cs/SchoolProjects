Two of my friends had never been in here, so as we walked down Telegraph, I ushered them into one of the sickest t-shirt/hoodie stores EVAR.  

They do a lot of East Bay shirts at this store - OAKLAND shirts with the Paramount Theater on the front, "Keep Merritt Green", and some obligatory Cal shirts.  My favorite shirt at this location is the BART map shirt...I was kind of glad to see they were out of the one shirt that I have from the SF location, because I'm hoping that hardly anyone has it and I won't have one of those moments where I run into someone else sporting the same shit.  

Upper Playground isn't for everyone - if you're scared of big graphics and crazy printed hoodies, this may not be your steez...but it's a pretty dope store nonetheless.
