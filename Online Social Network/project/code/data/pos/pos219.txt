I have been here twice so far, and both times the service was excellent!  

I got in within 10 minutes of arriving each time (granted both times were in the middle of a Monday, so maybe not rush hours).  The doctor listened to all of my symptoms and then came up with his diagnosis and explained to me what I could expect, what I should do at home and then what to do if it doesn't get better.  I really appreciated that he didn't just throw antibiotics at me and throw my out the door like many doctors do.  He took the time to explain everything and offered to write my a prescription of antibiotics if my illness didn't get better on its own within a few days, but left it up to me.

This is such a convenient location and they have great hours.

There is a parking lot that is open during the day at least around back, and if you pay for your ticket at the front desk they give you a dollar off I believe.  

They have urgent care hours as well as regular physician hours.
