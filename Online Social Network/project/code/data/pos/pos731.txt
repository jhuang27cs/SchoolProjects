I highly recommend the D.G.G.C. Best grilled cheese I have EVER had and both the cayenne cheddar bread and strawberry dip hit make this dish a home-run. My friend made a very wise decision in ordering this dish. Thankfully she was getting full so I was able to eat some of it ;-).

I would not recommend the Sunshine Scrambler--very bland and boring. The home fries are pretty good and have a good kick to them. 

I ordered the Sweet Almond tea which is a mix of coconut and almond. Fantastic! I would suggest ordering this to accompany the coconut pancake. Great combo!

The cold Boston attitude from the waitress was annoying.
