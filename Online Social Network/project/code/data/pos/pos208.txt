The service is mediocre and the ambiance is lacking. The prices are a little higher than I'd like to pay, but the naan is great and the tikka masala is out of this world. The basmati rice is perfect and the flavors in the tikka masala (which I usually get with chicken, which is always cooked to perfection) are delightful. I don't think I've tried anything else here because I'm so obsessed with this dish. Om nom nom.
