Considering I reaaaalllyyyy need to be the mood for steak, otherwise have no interest in the steakhouse, this place does a pretty nice job. 

Came here for a Goodbye Dinner with co-workers. Since I was not in the mood for steak, I ordered the Crab Cakes. Whooaaa. Sooo good. A little pricey, but thankfully I wasn't buying ! 

I can't say much for the steak, but the appetizers were also a killer. Nice drink selection - I had a few glasses of white to go with my crab. 

Friendly staff with good attitudes (and we all know how important that is to me!). Very chic venue with a good crowd. This place is worth a try !
