been back 4-5 times.  items are hit and miss, tho dinner is much nicer than lunch i think.  great atmosphere. tofu sandwich to-go was alright but slightly overpriced for what you get.  charlie ayers says he's workin on the veggie burger a bit more, been through 12 diff versions.  what i did like was that they listen to feedback.  service is slow but they seem genuine.  and the food is fresh and thoughtfully prepared.  i'm a fan.
