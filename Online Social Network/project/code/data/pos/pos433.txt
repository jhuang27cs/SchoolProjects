Why are there some non-5 star reviews for this local hardware store is my question. I've shopped here for over 10 years, and most of the staff are the same. They will take 20 minutes to teach you how to install something. They will all crowd around and ooh and ahh over the good deal you got on their favorite cordless drill, and your kids and dog can eat popcorn while you get that perfect screw for the task. We love this place and wouldn't think of going to Home Depot unless we need lumber.
