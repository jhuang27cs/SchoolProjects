Everyone here is all, "I LOVE THIS PLACE! Four stars." Screw that, man: a huge selection of beers on tap for not very much money, a great patio, tasty munchies, and pretty thoroughly reasonable sandwiches? I'm so down for that. Great on a warmer summer day, when you can find one.

It's a pub, not fine dining, but it's a damn good pub!
