TEN STARS for this place.  

1.  The atmosphere is fantastic.  We sat in the back corner with the perfect amount of sunlight and restaurant light.  It's quaintly and romantically decorated.  The front room/bar has an awesome fireplace to sit by.  

2.  The service is wonderful.  Attentive, helpful and patient.  

3.  The food.  Whoa.  SO GOOD.  I had the linguine con carciofi with shrimp.  It was perfectly prepared and light.  I didn't feel weighed down by eating a big pasta dish.  I had a really amazing dessert, but for some reason what it was escapes me (damn the delicious red wine...).

4.  The aforementioned wine - great selection and very very nice.  

5.  I'd recommend this place to anyone.  If I didn't have such a thing for trying new restaurants, I'd probably just keep going here and never expand my circle...

Way to go Red House!
