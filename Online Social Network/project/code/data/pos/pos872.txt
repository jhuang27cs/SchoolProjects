this place is awesome - plenty of room and very authentic food.  parking can be a pain once in a while, but the food is fresh and the choices are amazing.  so many choices and things to eat.  portions are very generous as well.  wish there was some spicier sauce tho, but overall would very much highly recommend!  thumbs up
