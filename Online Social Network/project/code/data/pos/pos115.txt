I've been meaning to drop in and try their sweets.  So I've read the other reviews, and I'm not sure if the cakes are made from scratch, a box, or what, but I will say the staff working on Saturday September 12, 2009 at about 9:00 PM were friendly, attentive, and very helpful.  
I had a red velvet brownie/cheesecake combo.......and mmmm.  My partner had a chocolate brownie, and MMMMMMMM.

We had coffee and cake and loved it.  We'll be back.  The cake prices are fairly competitive, and lots of people were coming in picking up cakes, and from what I saw they were beautiful.  Not sure how they tasted, but we'll be back and will up date more information here.

The decor is cute.  I am so glad they're here!  Their website is full of information and is also a good place to visit for more information.
