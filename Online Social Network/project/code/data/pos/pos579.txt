I saw A Midsummer Night's Dream here and had a great time. The theatre is this neat Tudor building with lots of brick and dark wood inside, which really makes you feel like you're taking a trip back in time, or at least across the Atlantic to a cozy pub/playhouse. I appreciate their traditionalist approach to Shakespeare, using Elizabethan costumes and music to help tell the story. They went to a lot of effort to make the play accessible and enjoyable for everyone, even people who haven't studied Shakespeare and who aren't quite able to follow the language. Midsummer had lots of physical comedy and some fun fairy special effects.

They offer $2.50 pints of Guinness, Bass, Newcastle, Strongbow and Sweetwater IPA on Friday nights, and they will make you black and tans for an extra English tavern treat. Food was decent -- chips and guac appetizer comes with an impressive mountain of tasty dip. Everything's pre-made and warmed up for you, or in the case of my veggie sandwich, delivered to your plate still wrapped in cellophane. But the prices were reasonable -- we spent around $30 for beers, an appetizer, and two entrees.

We came on half price ticket night, and I'm not sure if I'm anxious to pay full price to come back. Maybe I'm too much of a snob to get into slapstick, and maybe they take a different tack with other plays, but while I had a good time, this place didn't leave me feeling like I'd had a great night-at-the-theatre experience. For $28/person (regular price for floor seats, not including any food or drinks) I kind of want that. But I will check out another show, preferably one of the histories or tragedies, if they have another special event like this.
