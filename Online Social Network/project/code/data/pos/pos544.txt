We went to Green Street for Valentine's Day and I absolutely loved it. We started off we cocktails and an appetizer. I ordered the Maple Leaf cocktail and was amazed at how wonderful this drink was! I will definitely be coming back for this drink alone, (I believe it was only Canadian whiskey, lemon and maple syrup but was impressed nonetheless!)

We ordered the mussels as an appetizer and I have to say that this is the dish that converted me once an for all as a mussel lover. The mussels were served in a savory broth with crispy bread and sauerkraut. Amazing!

The main meal paled in comparison to the drinks and appetizers but it was still a decent meal. I ordered the fluke with a grilled frisee salad and it came with golden beets, grapefruit and a yogurt on top. It was an odd combination of flavors but it all seemed to work. 

The atmosphere  was very laid back and cozy and I can't wait to go back to Green Street for drinks and appetizers!
