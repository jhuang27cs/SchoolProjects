Was a great help and I would gladly use his services again...

Although my particular debts were outside of his expertise (private and federal student loans specifically) he was very kind and took the time to meet with me on a Saturday which really helped because I work 9-5 M-F. 

He was informative and up to date on his information and steered me in the right direction with my issues even though that meant sending me away to a different specialty lawyer. He was fair and honest and could have easily led me on but gave me the facts straight up which made the whole process go smoother for me, I highly recommend Cliff for any type of typical bankruptcy filing, he was very patient.
