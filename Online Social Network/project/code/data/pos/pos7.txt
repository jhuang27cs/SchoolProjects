The only thing I've ever eaten at Time-Out is their ice cream cookie sandwich thing, and that's really all I need.  It's about a half-gallon of ice cream sandwiched between two large-ish chocolate chip cookies.  I don't know if they make it, or if it comes off a truck, or what... but it's frozen so solid you usually have to wait a few minutes before chowing down so you don't break a tooth.

If nothing else, they are one of the few old standards on Franklin Street that have not succumbed to the high-end shopping takeover, so they are worth being excited about.

Do watch out for drunken Tarheels, though.  This place has more disgusting drunkenness issues late at night than any bar I've been in.
