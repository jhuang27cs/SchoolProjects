Love this place! It's one of my favorite little cheap noodle houses in the U. and I've been going here for like, 10 years. Not much of an atmosphere, unless you like pictures of terriyaki. Tempura Udon, Teriyaki and a mountain of Yakisoba are all great here. Lot's of great food for not a lot of money.
