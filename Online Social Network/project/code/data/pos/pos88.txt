You can't be a UCLA student and not go to this place and I've got a horrible case of The Sweet Tooth so needless to say, I kept  the place in business. I haven't been here for a while but from my recollection, the cookies were good and cheap, what more could you ask for? White Chocolate Macadamia nut...yummmm. I never tried that ice cream sandwhich everyone raves about but ice cream=good, cookies=good, so simple mathematics would dictate that ice cream+cookies=good. I miss you, Diddy Riese! It's been far too long since we've last met!
