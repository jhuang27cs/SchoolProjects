This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but its actually pretty good.

The food - while not the best Thai food I have ever had - is pretty tasty, and the price is very right.

It's not a fancy restaurant, but its pleasant, nice and clean.  It's really quite a bargain considering how little they charge for the food.
