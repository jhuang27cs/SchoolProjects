I really like pet People for their customer service.  All of the people that work here that I've met have been very gentle with my puppy.  When I came here to check out their food selections, I was impressed that they carried human-grade quality dog food like Orijen, Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, etc.  Unfortunately, they do not sell Acana which is also made by Champion Pet Foods.  

The selection of toys here is okay.  They carry kongs, some teething toys, West Paw Design toys (I highly recommend the Hurley!), and tennis balls.  They have a pretty good variety of pet supplies too, much like PetsMart, but since PetsMart has a larger store they can carry a lot more.

All in all, I like coming to Pet People to pick up toys for my puppy and just to peruse what they have in stock.
