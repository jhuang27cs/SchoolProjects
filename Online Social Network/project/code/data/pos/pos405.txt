I've never had anything I didn't like here and I try to get something different every time. They have a nice list of unique appetizers that I haven't seen at many other places. Unfortunately I can't remember the names of them but there's this one that is baby corn with paneer and deep fried. Yum.

It is a little pricey so for people like me who like to try a little bit of a few things like you can at a buffet it's hard to decide on an entree.

The atmosphere is inviting and the service is very good.
