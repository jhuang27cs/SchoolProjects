kimchee fried noodles with spam 
The noodles are machined pulled fresh which provides a very chewy but firm texture. The spiciness is just right not too hot not too bland. The sunny side fried egg adds an extra touch. 4/5

They only have 8 seats in the small room so getting to go is a better bet. All the dishes are under $9 and they also have self serve tea and water. I would come back just to try their other things or just get the kimchee noodles again.

PS ramen is packaged here so you can probably make it yourself at home. Get the rice or fried noodle instead.
