On a recent visit to SLO, I got taken out to the Natural Cafe, which bears a distinct resemblance to some of the places I remember from growing up in Berkeley. Very natural woodsy, with just enough sprouts on the sandwich to add a little crunch.  It's casual, with counter service only.

My turkey burger was not too dry, but the guacamole and special sauce helped it along in the moistness department. I didn't walk away from the meal feeling all gross and over full like you would with a normal burger and fries.  Yeah for whole grains and veggies!
