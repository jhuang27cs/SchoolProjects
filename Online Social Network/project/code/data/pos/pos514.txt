I was excited to go to Busboys and Poets because it seems to fill a void in the Hyattsville/College Park/etc. area for cute coffee shops. I was surprised that this place is much more than just coffee and tea, however--it is a full restaurant! 

My boyfriend and I went and sat on some of the cozy armchairs by the front window and ordered cups of tea, and also a falafel pita. The service was very slow at first because no one came to take our order for about 15 minutes, but once we caught their eye, the service was fine. The tea was delicious and the food was fresh and well-prepared. The fresh fruit that came on the side was also really tasty and fresh--some of the best blueberries I've ever had! We stayed for about 2 hours playing Words with Friends on our phones and did not feel that we were being rushed out. It was a very pleasant afternoon and I will surely go back.

Also, the sinks in the bathroom are really cool. Check them out!
