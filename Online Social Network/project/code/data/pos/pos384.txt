I love this place, not as much as the tart fro yo from yogurt harmony but its an amazing sweet treat (especially the pumpkin!!). My only complaint is the inconsistency in the amount of toppings you get. A few weeks ago I went and had sprinkles in every bite, yum!.... I went again last night and was saddened by the total of 8 sprinkles the gal put on top. The do put toppings inside which deserves recognition. Overall, I'm a fan.
