Yes, the jewelry is cheap and sometimes the clothes smell, but every once in a while you can find a real gem.

Some stuff is definitely not worth the $3.99, but others are a steal.  Sunglasses, housewares, dresses, leather jackets (if you find a cool one), and lotsa costume-y things like suspenders, wigs, etc.  

I don't know if it's somewhere I'd drive out of my way to, but there is an Urban Outfitters, Victorias Secret, Aahs and American Apparel on the same street, and a Buffalo Exchange a block over.  (Plus it's an excuse to grab an ice cream sandwich at diddy riese!)
