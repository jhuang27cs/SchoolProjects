Ordered 2 dozen the week before Christmas and could not have been happier! Jane herself drove all the way to northwest (very northwest) austin to deliver them. They were delicious and adorably packaged and just perfect.  Good Macarons are hard to come by in these parts so I was stoked to find someone who delivers them!
