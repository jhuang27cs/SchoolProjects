I used to work next to The Vortex and even though I have since moved far away, it is still my favorite place for burgers.  I went back around Thanksgiving to find with dismay that they took my normal order off the menu: The Choker extra rare on wheat toast with the fried zucchini and a side of blue cheese.  I am a pain in the ass with burgers, I know, but the Vortex has always been very accommodating.  Fortunately they still had the artichoke spread on the appetizer menu and were happy to make my favorite for me!.  So my craving for the Vortex, which was 2 years in the making, was finally satisfied.
