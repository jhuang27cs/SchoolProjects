Neil is awesome. We sent a few emails back and forth about what we were looking for, and when we came in, he pulled out a tray of about 15 diamonds covering a broad spectrum of quality. He unwrapped about 5 at a time, telling us what the differences were, demonstrating how to use the magnifier to find the flaws in each diamond, and taking us outside to show how they look in natural light. As we slowly eliminated diamonds that were outside our desired parameters, he took them away and replaced them with new ones, until we found one that was perfect for us. We wouldn't have picked this stone before coming in, but Neil's demonstrations helped us discover what qualities were important to us, and we are extremely happy with our decision.

The best part about this process is that we never felt rushed at any point during the 4 hours we were there. Neil made this explicitly clear to us, and each time he was done answering our questions, he popped out to the back so we could have a private conversation about what we thought of the diamonds. We also felt like he had more stones to pull out if we were dissatisfied about any aspect, and in the end, we picked our diamond because we were sure we would not ever be able to find a better one.

The prices here are amazing - comparable to Blue Nile or Costco, but with the immeasurable benefit of having an actual jeweler. Neil's post-purchase policy was another major factor in our decision - any regular maintenance on the ring would be covered for life. He also offers upgrades on rings, although he charges a restocking fee on the diamond, which he explained is a precaution against future fluctuations in diamond prices.
