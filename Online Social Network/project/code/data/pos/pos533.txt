Awesome outdoor playground and play area for kids. There is a big lawn (with hills) where kids can run around and expend their pent-up energy. There are also swings of all kinds: baby swings, swings for toddlers, tube swings, and lots of slides, monkey bars, tunnel mazes, climbing ropes, and activity centers for kids. As others have mentioned, yes, this place gets busy with the under-5 crowd, but sometimes your little one enjoys it and wants to feel like he's a part of the action even if he's too young to play with other kids! 
There is a cute rose garden nearby, bountiful picnic tables for lunching families, outdoor basketball courts, and of course, the bike- and dog-friendly Bolin Creek nearby. Haven't been to the pool inside, but the climbing gym is pretty nifty. Based on the outdoor space, the CHCC is tops!
