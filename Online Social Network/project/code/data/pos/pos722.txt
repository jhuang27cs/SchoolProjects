This is the kind of class that will remind you that you're not in decent shape when you think that you are. I like yoga and pilates, and I also did dance when I was younger, but none of that mattered when it came to taking this class. Yesterday was my first barre type of class ever...and it more than kicked my ass! 

It felt very circuit-like with stretching between each move, but it also didn't feel like some boring routine (which is good!). The small movements really bite you in the butt, literally...I'm actually happy that I get to sit down all day at work because there's no way I'd want to be walking today. Gold star for the music - it's true that this really keeps you going. I think at one point I was so tuned into the music that I forgot about how much pain I was in and pushed myself even harder. The women (and one man) in there seemed to be regulars because none of them had to stop and take any breaks (unlike me who probably skipped a few 5, 6, and 7 counts). 

Docking one star because the location is kind of weird especially for a first timer - I probably would have gotten there earlier if there were signs pointing to the main entrance instead of meandering to the back entrance where the door can lock..... 

I probably won't be doing it again in the Seattle location since it's no where near my home or work, but I do plan on using my free class in the Bellevue location. Though, the instructor and the front desk were very friendly! I also kind of want to try Barre3, just to compare.
