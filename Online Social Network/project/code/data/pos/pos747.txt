Lobster is expensive people - period - so yes, you will spend more at this food truck than some of the others.  But it is worth it!  Just went back for my second visit to the Lobsta Love truck.  first time I ws offered a free sample of chowder, and purchased a lobster slider.  The roll that is comes on is amazing - and I was surprised by the significant amount of lobster in the slider.  Plus, it came with a side of chips.  So for $6, not a bad deal.  Today, I was offered a free shot of the bisque.  It was really, really good with lots of lobster peices.  I then ordered the lobster roll for $15.  It's your typical hot dog roll (I do prefer the roll that the slider comes on) and is packed full of meat.  Overflowing, in fact, so I used my side of chips to scoop up the extra meat.  Mmmmm.  Tempted to go try a crab slider next...
