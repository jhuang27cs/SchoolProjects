Sometimes I foolishly forget that this is down the road from my place, but I have just recently started going again regularly, and though it's a quick trip, I always find something I need or have been craving without any problems. It is a real PA Dutch market (Though I don't think the people who run the place are Amish, maybe Mennenite? Also there is a butcher when you first come in and they wear baseball caps and are def. not Amish) and the prices are reasonable, and everything is clearly marked and displayed. I finally was able to find here the thick-cut bacon that I love to use in my recipes (after resorting to regular bacon or worse, ham) at a good price. I also love their fresh pretzels, their selection of cheese, butter (5 bucks for a sleeve the size of my arm of butter! nuts!). Their vegetable section could stand to carry more things, but I don't know how that works. Anyway, also the last Saturday of each month they have a pig roast. I've never gotten anything from the snack bar during those times, but I've seen their giant pulled pork sandwiches and people gorging themselves on them, so they can't be that bad. 

Note- only opened Thursday-Saturday. When I use to work at home on Thursdays, I would go and it wouldn't be that bad. Saturday mornings are nightmares, so sometimes I even wait until 2 to go when the crowds thin out.  The Saturday morning crowds are also a bit nuts, and be prepared to be pegged in the shin by many a shopping cart. They take only cash but there is an ATM there and also in the convenience store further down in the same shopping plaza.
