2 for 1 breakfast burrito Tuesdays??

those are the key words to a broke college student's ears.  And when you get it and its dripping in that nice breafkast eggs and oily sausage sauce, you can't but hold that nice plump burrito in hesitation and enjoy that first bite in SLO motion.  

But other than that breakfast burrito, I've never come here for anything else.  Is there any reason to?  

AND, you can call ahead to place an order for those on the way to school and just wanted to pick it up really quick.
