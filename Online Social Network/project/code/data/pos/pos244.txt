Walking around Cambridge in eleven degree weather has a tendency to make one cranky. Imagine that.

So with L.A. Burdick Chocolate Cafe in sight, I decided to employ the palliative sweet sworn upon by a well-known choleric demographic:  PMSing women. 

Seconds away from being a Laurensicle, I opted for my chocolate in hot liquid form. Specifically, a large hot milk chocolate. Which, according to their sign, is simply milk and melted shaved chocolate. (Three sizes: Demi - $2.00; Small - $3.00, Large - $4.50)

Mm...heaven. With one sip, the cold and mounting annoyance seemed to dwindle. Delicious. Strangely, I was reminded of the hot chocolate description in the book The Polar Express, rich like "melted nougat".  I sipped until my lactose-sensitive stomach threatened to rebel. I can't wait to go back to introduce friends and family to this incredible treat. Stomach and wallet be damned.
