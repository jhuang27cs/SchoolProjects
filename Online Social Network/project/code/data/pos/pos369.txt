Twas a good dining experience with some good company.

Came here during the last ten minutes of happy hour and pretty much ordered all that I could.

The pork belly was pretty good. They weren't all cooked to the same level. half of them were deliciously crispy but the other half were limp and droopy, not the most ideal situation, if you know what i mean. The rice cakes were my favorite. Plenty of sauce and perfectly gummy. The veggie one is the spicy one while the beef is not. I would have liked a beefy spicy but she said that they couldn't do that. We also ordered one of every bun. and they were pretty yum! The spicy chicken was my favorite, pork a close second, beef I could skip. We finished off our meal with a sizzling bimbimbap and it wasn't much different from all the others. Good though. 

The place was pretty affordable and there's 2 hours free parking after 6pm with validation. They say they're "healthy" Korean food but I don't really know how. This place was good and I enjoyed myself but I definitely like the real stuff in all it's unhealthy glory from ktown...
