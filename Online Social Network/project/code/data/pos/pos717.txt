SOooooo good and they have happy hour with $2 mini cheeseburgers and half off apps (drink specials as well I just can't remember what they are!) and DEF. go on Tuesday when they have a chef's special with four gourmet mini-burgers that are paired with beers and wines.  SO good.  I am not the best at building my own burger- so I love going on Tuesday when the chef pulls out the big guns!  Don't miss the sweet potato fries and the garlic parmesan fries- yummy!
