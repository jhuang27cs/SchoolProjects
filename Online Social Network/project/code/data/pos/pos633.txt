This shop is fantastic! It's a tiiiiny little shop filled to the brim with vintage treasure. Everything is in fantastic condition, clean (no musty weird smells or mysterious stains). I felt like I was browsing through a closet, the pieces were so well-chosen. The owner is sweet as pie, as was her huge puppy that was wandering the store. The prices here are a little steep, but they're worth it. The owner knows her stuff, and knows what the items are worth, so you won't be walking away with a "steal" like you might at other places. However, you'll walk away with something worth what you paid, and know it's going to last.

When I was in, she was even offering to alter a swimsuit another customer was trying on. I don't know if this is normal or if it was a regular client or a friend, but it was still pretty rad to witness that level of service. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in that area!
