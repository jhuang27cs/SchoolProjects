I have been going to Goode Company for nearly twenty years now, and in that time this BBQ icon has been consistently delicious every time.  As a matter of fact, my intense love of good Texas BBQ was nurtured at the Goode's establishment. 

The building feels like what you'd expect of a good old fashioned BBQ joint, Texas decor, classic country music, and floors worn and scuffed from over three decades of cowboy boots.

The ribs and brisket have always been delicious and are can't miss items. As odd as it may sound, I highly recommend the BBQ duck, it is phenomenal. The homemade jalape√±o bread and cold beer is a perfect way to compliment the great meat. 

Although many Texans may scoff at the idea of BBQ sauce, Goode co truly makes some of the best sauce around. You know it's good when vegetarians are warned that the sauce contains beef bits. I even had bottles of the sauce sent to me one year when I was studying in Europe (the most expensive sauce ever after transatlantic shipping!)

The sides are good as well. I tend the order the jambalaya.  I've never been a fan of beans or potato salad of any sort, so I can offer no judgement here. 

Before you leave, be sure to grab some pecan pie, it's legendary in Houston. 

Overall, Goode Company has been one of my favorites and I would certainly recommend it to anyone searching for a good meal. 

(Folks from Lockhart are excluded from this recommendation as the notion of BBQ sauce is blasphemous to you)
