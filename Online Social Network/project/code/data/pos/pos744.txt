We went here for breakfast on a weekday and it was fabulous! Not as pricey as the $45 brunch I see mentioned in other reviews, but I definitely want to try that too. I've always wanted to try this place but I had no idea that it was in the Charles Hotel - it's so hidden away! 

The cinnamon cranberry french toast with real Vermont maple syrup was tasty with perfectly textured, not too dry bread and chunks of cinnamon inside. I think it would make it even more perfect if they added some pecans to the bread, or maybe some candied pecans on top. The poached egg with ham on bread with a side of asparagus was also quite good. I do wish my coffee was a little hotter and that they refilled it more often. This is definitely a solid breakfast stop. They serve till 11 AM on weekdays.
