My mom has taken my daughter to three plays here.  I finally agreed to go this past Sunday, for their rendition of Beauty and the Beast.  I was blown away!  The actors and actresses are very, very good, and they involve the children in the stories.

They will perform Sleeping Beauty in April--get your tickets early!!
