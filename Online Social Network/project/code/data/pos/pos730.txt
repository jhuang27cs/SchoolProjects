This place is easy to find and wasn't too crowded for a party of 8 to celebrate New Year's Eve.

Our waiter was so cute and super helpful. The food was really yummy. Shi So Hot (or whatever the proper name is) was a hit! Everyone loved it. The sashimi was really yummy too. 

And the tea was actual matcha which was really nice on a cold night.
