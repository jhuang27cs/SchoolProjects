I love Judie's.   I probably go there maybe every other week.

The popovers are delicious.  I don't know why someone said that Amherst had underdeveloped taste buds?  That's real nice... Please don't come back then.

And every time I go there I get the BBQ Chicken Sandwich which I love.  It is flavorful and very filling.

I remember the lines being very long.  However, it was fairly quick.  Lately though, there have been no lines and I've gone around peak dinner hours.

Two people on here said they should have gone to the Route 9 Diner instead.  And they say they have better taste?  Right...
