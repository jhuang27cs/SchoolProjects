I have so many fond memories of Rendez-Vous.  It's an awesome spot to stop for some lunch...the wraps are amazing, or for some dessert-type fare...I'm a sucker for nutella anything.  Also, absolutely LOVE the rooftop porch in the summertime, great spot to smoke a hookah and relax with friends.  This is the way cafes are meant to be!
