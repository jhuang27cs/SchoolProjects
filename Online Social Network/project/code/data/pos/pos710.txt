There is always a line at this hole in the wall, and right fully so.  Stopped in today, as I haven't been there in awhile, and had the Austrian Lentil Soup.  Frick'n excellent. 

Lentils, Spaetzel, bacon, carrots, celery, slices of franks and perfect blend of spices. Stock was thin with a touch of cream. It was mostly soup and could have used a few more chunks of goodies in my bowl for the $6 price, but it was delectible.
