I love Finn's! Mainly because of their 1$ wells Wednesday but also because they always make great strong drinks. It's conveniently located right on the ave and the atmosphere is always lively but not too crazy. If you're ever in the u-district area and looking for a great cheap drink Finn's is definitely the place to be.
