I can't believe I waited so long to write a review on such a stellar place! I'm so sorry, Polkadots!

Best red velvet in Austin, and I know red velvet. Moist and light, with the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had. It has specks of vanilla bean in it! Do you hear me? 

I have tried all of their cupcakes, and all are fab. Never dry. There's nothing worse than a dry cupcake at upscale prices (Hi, Hey Cupcake!)

Service is great! They are so nice there! I've had multiple encounters, all positive. 

They are great for office functions. Nothing creates team players better than delicious cupcakes. Plus, they deliver!

Got two dozen for my kid's birthday party, and when I picked them up, the owner gave my daughter a beautiful, specially decorated cookie.

Just top notch. Well played, Polkadots.
