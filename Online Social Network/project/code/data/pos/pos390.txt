We drive from Livonia to Ann Arbor just to visit this location. We have other RMCF stores that are closer, but they don't have the selection or as friendly a service. The chocolate and vanilla swirl fudge is amazing but isn't always available. It is a little pricey but keep in mind this is a premium chocolateer. If you want cheap chocolate buy a Hershey bar. If you desire a high quality, rich and creamy chocolate RMCF is the place to go. They also offer 16 flavors of ice cream, several different milkshakes, caramel/chocolate covered apples, and much more.
