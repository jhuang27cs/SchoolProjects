Great little drug store.  They have all the essentials in case you (ahem) leave the house without deodorant or need to buy floss because you can't get part of your lunch out from between your teeth.  I speak from experience.  

The pharmacy is excellent too, very quick to fill prescriptions.  I have more faith in them than the drones at CVS not to screw up my prescription refills.  

While this is part of the Sav-Mor chain, this drug store feels way less chainy than most of your other pharmacy options around town.  Also, this place has been around for a long time... probably longer than Perry Drugs (remember those?).  I recently saw a photo of South U in 1969 and noticed the same distinctive Village Apothecary store front.
