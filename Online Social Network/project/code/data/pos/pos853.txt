I came here for an event this past week. The party I was attending took over the front room near the window. There was a slight draft coming in from the window but the warmth of the company kept me feeling good.

The restaurant had arranged a spread of different finger foods. There was cheese platter, a hummus/tzatziki/tabbouleh plate, and spinach and artichoke dip. The hummus was delightfully creamy, but tasted more natural and authentic than typical Sabra-brand. The spinach and artichoke dip was not to be missed - delightfully buttery in taste. These items were paired with toasted pita triangles and extremely delicious chips (that tasted like healthy was not exactly a factor when cooking them). There were also crackers, a veggie plate, and a fruit platter.

I didn't get a chance to sample any of the main dishes on the menu, but I did knock back some cocktails. There was a tasty gin drink that I nursed for a while.

The restaurant was large and perfect for the size of our 20+ party. There was also an area upstairs, housing a separate party that would have been sufficiently-sized for ours as well.
