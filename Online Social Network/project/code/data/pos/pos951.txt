Fellinis large pizza is too expensive for me, but you can buy slices with all kinds of toppings-- this makes Fellinis unique....the slices are 4 stars and the hot pizzas out of the oven are 5 stars...

the sandwiches are great....my favorite pizza is the spinachoke...try it you will like it....

Also, At different times, I get the Italian Wedding Soup or the Portuguese Sausage Soup....highly recommend--

In summary, the menu is a Hit-List.............
