went here on a whim.  I get regular professional massages but don't want to start to pay down my deductible quite yet.  Also, didnt want to wait 2 weeks for appt so stopped in here.  I was really surprised how much I liked it.  They were professional, the place is serene with comfortable beds, the girl who did my massage was STRO
NG!  If you do not like deep tissue type massage this place might not be for you but I do like it so it was perfect.  It looks sketch from the outside but they run a nice place inside.  Try it out.  note:To use a credit card they charge $1 for under $50 and $2 for over.  They don't take checks so best to bring cash IMHO.
