This place is beautiful and sexy and spacious and I was just feeling the whole vibe jumping off in here.  I was here for a Motorola event and was able to hear a live performance and the sound system is on point.  

I love the decor with the lounge couches and tucked away areas.  I didn't see where a dance floor would be though (problemo!!!).  Maybe it was up those stairs that big, huge bouncer wouldn't let me up.  

Anyway, I will be back here.
