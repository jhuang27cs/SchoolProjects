The Red Light location in the U-District is quite a bit smaller than the one in Capitol Hill. They still offer a great selection of items.

PARKING: Street parking. This is in the core retail section of Broadway on the Hill. This is paid parking with the City of Seattle meters. This just down the street from the Metro Clothing Company, Buffalo Exchange, and Goodwill, so it's not a waste of money if you're looking for a shopping spree.

SELECTION/CONSISTENCY: Naturally, the selection is dependent on what they are able to buy from people off the street. For the most part, they are consistently solid in being able to product a fine selection of old school clothing.

PRICING: Vintage store prices, don't expect to buy items at thrift store prices. Some of the higher priced items are cheaper than what you'd find on Craiglist. I consistently see this when looking at their Pendleton jackets.

SERVICE: They have a friendly staff. I've purchased an item at the other location and was able to exchange it here; I thought that was a big plus.
