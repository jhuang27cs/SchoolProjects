Reliable, good quality, friendly service, large selection of items, easy-to-get-to location. 

I've been to Le's a few times now and I've never been disappointed. The quality of food from their kitchen is good-quality every time. Vegetables always taste fresh, sauces have great consistency and flavor, and dishes come out piping hot. In my opinion you get more than you pay for when it comes to quality at Le's.

The atmosphere is a bit like a romantically-lit cafeteria: lots of cramped tables, tile floors, chairs stored odd places, but really you get what you pay for when it comes to ambiance. I have had consistently good service -- very friendly waiters, super fast food delivery to my table, and very prompt with the water/check/additional items.

I love Vietnamese and I will definitely go back here for cheap quality eats.
