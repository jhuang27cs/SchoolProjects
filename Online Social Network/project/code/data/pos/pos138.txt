Augggh, this place has spoiled me for other vegetarian restaurants, which just never seem to be quite as good. That said, my carnivorous family felt like hitting up the Burger King on the way home, so maybe it doesn't work as well for the non-vegetarian-inclined.

One of its cookbooks, Moosewood Cooks at Home, also holds the honor of being the only cookbook I've ever cooked more than one recipe out of.
