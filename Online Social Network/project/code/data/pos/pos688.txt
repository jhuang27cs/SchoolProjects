This place was great. Tucked in the corner of Town and Country, this small sandwich spot definitely was worth the parking hassle. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich which was delicious, the only complaint being that they used white bread instead of the sliced wheat I asked for (and didn't realize until I opened the bag when I got home). Would definitely recommend it!
