Even though I always eat dinner till I'm about to pop, there's ALWAYS room for desserts. So after I finished my bowl at Flamebroiler right across the street, I slowly and carefully made my way to Diddy Riese, just like a pregnant woman at her 9 months :)

I was soooo excited because I've had sOOo many failed attempts of waiting in line for about 10 minutes and then not having enough patience to wait any longer. But this time I had a much stronger determination, especially because I was on a low-carb diet the week before and I was FEINDING for sweets!

As I was jumping up and down in anticipation while waiting in line, I was also deciding which combo to get. The choice is TWO different cookies and an ice cream flavor. After about 20 minutes of flipping back and forth between different flavors, I finally settled on a original chocolate chip cookie, chocolate white chocolate chip cookie, with mint chocolate chip ice cream. It was quite a risky choice, I'd have to say myself, but I wasn't disappointed! ESPECIALLY because it was only a buck fifty!! woohoo

In an ideal world if nutrition didn't matter and only calories did, and if I had to choose a single place to eat at everyday as a homeless person, it'd be diddy reise, because I swear, it's wayyy cheaper than a MickeyD's meal! DIDDY REISE FTW! :D
