On the menu: Clam chowder bread bowl w/ bacon.  

Nom nom nom.  Came to this cafe after the SLO graduation, and there was no line wait: around 1:30pm.  Win.  Service was quick.  Win. Chowder was delish (not too salty). Win.  The bread bowl topped it off... the bread extracted from the middle was toasted and buttered for my consumption... jackpot!  If I'm ever back in SLO, must hit up this cafe again.
