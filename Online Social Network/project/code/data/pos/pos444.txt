I was super excited when Cold Stone opened a store right by USC several years ago.  I LOVE their Strawberry Shortcake Serenade (I don't think it's on the menu anymore, but it's amazing)!  It's made of sweet cream ice cream, strawberries, and yellow cake, all topped with whipped cream...  Yum...  =)

Unfortunately, they were out of whipped cream (WHAT?!?!) tonight, which was extremely disappointing because what good is strawberry shortcake anything without whipped cream?  The server was nice enough to offer a different topping instead, but there is no substitute for whipped cream, so I turned it down.  I was pretty disappointed, but still got the "Like It" size since I was already there.

4-stars for Cold Stone Creamery - their Strawberry Shortcake Serenade is AMAZING (especially with whipped cream!), but they lose 1 star because it's really overpriced ($4.99 for a "Like It" a.k.a. small size!  When did the price go up so much?).
