This is one of my favorite bars to hang out in Urbana. Whenever I feel like listening to some jazz music, I would check this place out because many local musicians play here. The food here is super CHEAP. I think the salmon burger is just $4 and 1lb fries for $2. It is excellent with their black pepper sauce. They have specials on other days as well.
