Our group ordered 4 Tri-tip sandwiches, one ABC and half a BBQ chicken. A few orders of fries and onion rings. Asked for extra BBQ sauce and they gave about a cup per person. I guess their BBQ sauce is like gold out here and when I tasted it, I understood why! One of the tastiest BBQ sauces that ever touched my lips. *thumbs up!*
