As noted by many past revewiers this place is not easy on your wallet unless you are shopping carefully. Most regular goods are a bit overpriced, I didn't shop too carefully as I was more on the trip to check it out, I yelped before hand and decided my wallet could not take high prices, no matter how good a cause it was for. 

However the bulk spice, grain and tea isle was what I really wanted to check out. I was not dissapointed. I found every spice I could ever immagine wanting, past episodes flashed of me flipping through recipies saying to myself "where would I EVER find that" flashed before my eyes. I bought a few small packets of essential spices and made a note to come back whenever I wanted to make an interesting recipie where i needed just a bit of spices. Side note: the spices i did buy nothing came out to over a dollar. Granted i bought small amounts i highly doubt i will go through them with any great speed. The spices alone get this place a solid 3 stars. Over priced spices is a pet peeve of mine what can i say. 

The grains were exciting as well but not as much for me as im not a huge baker. Oatmeal seemed well priced and one of my roomates bought some granola that was good. Damn good. So good I have been contimplating stealing it. 

Finally I like the idea of a food co-op. Buying from there makes me happy. I like to support local merchants. If I had a steady job I would probably take the hit in the wallet, but i dont, so im not gonna. The price brings it down to 4 stars. Unfortunate but true, not everyone wants to spend on this stuff :( 

Go for the spices and grains, stay and see if theres anything else that strikes your fancy
