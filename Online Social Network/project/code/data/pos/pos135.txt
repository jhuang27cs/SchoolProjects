i'm a gal that likes her meat. a lot. bloody, juicy, medium-rare to rare meat. the less PC, the better. lamb, love it. veal, delicious. sorry PETA, meat is yummy, and i eat what tastes good. i tried to be vegetarian for a while because my best friend in high school was, but that lasted a solid three months before i started cheating. with bacon cheeseburgers. 

thusly, a place like gather, known for its vegetarian, nay, vegan fare, was somewhere i expected to enjoy more for say, their libations. however, gather is not at all what i expected - a polished 1-2 punch of cafeteria-style dining plus bar with a menu that includes minimal lentils and leans more towards fresh, seasonal dishes that most would call "california cuisine," and i call "just plain delicious." the vegan charcuterie platter lives up to its reputation as an artistic and appetizing sampling of vegetables, herbs, and nuts. while gather does have some vegan options that would scare a carnivore like myself ("cheese" made of cashews and leeks? no thanks), there is also homemade porchetta (pork wrapped in pork belly, 'nuff said). 

i may never be a convert to the vegetarian revolution (bacon is too damn yummy!), but i applaud gather for their inventive preparations and creative combinations of flavor, which ensured that i didn't miss the meat at all.

PS - the bar fully keeps up with the kitchen as far as imagination goes; my favorite concoction was the bee sting, a slurp-able combo of square one botanical, lemon, fresh mint, ginger, and honey syrup (but be wise; don't slurp and drive).
