Hands down the best brunch in town! Their lunch and dinner isn't as phenomenal, however (I learned that pretty early on during my undergrad career dining here). Definitely expect a wait if you're going on a morning during the weekend! Depending on the amount of people in your party it can be anywhere from 20-40 minutes. 

Their best dishes are the Salmon Bruschetta, the Molettes, and the Spanish Frittata. If you come early enough, they might still have some of their delicious scratch-made biscuits left for you (they run out quickly)! Their potatoes that come with any of "Our Old Favorites" choices are also great, and if you decide to go for an omelet, don't worry - they don't skimp out on the fillings you choose! My boyfriend recently had their Tofu Scramble as well and he loved it. While you're paying your bill at the register, don't forget to snag some of the freshly-baked desserts at the counter baked from Bollos Cafe down the street! 

I've been a loyal Gillies fan for the past 5 years and haven't been disappointed. I hope you join the fanclub soon! :)
