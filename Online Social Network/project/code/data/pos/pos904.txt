For the price and location (ann arbor), the food here is very good.  Echoing the reviews below, you just need to order off the Chinese menu and you should have a much better experience.  If you order anything Americanized (sweet and sour pork, etc etc), you probably wont have as good a experience.  

Personally I like the pork and string beans, as well as the singapore noodles.  Portions are GIANT, each dish is at least 2 meals.  Which is great for poor students.  And if you go with the right person, you should be able to get a free dish or two...
