I had just finished dinner and was very full. My sister on the other hand, had a hankering for ice cream. Her friend knew of a "little place" we could get some. This is how we stumbled into Full Tilt. After trying a few flavors I decided on the Coffee 'n Coffee Cake ice cream, which, doesn't taste much like coffee but is in fact DELICIOUS. Perfect flavor, chunks of cake....please sir may I have some more?

I ordered one scoop so when the woman behind the counter (who was a riot!) gave me this heaping  helping that required several dunks into the tub I thought she misheard me and gave me two scoops.

I was pleased to discover that no, she did not mishear me. Their "one scoop" is just simply that overwhelming. Bless this place. I wish there was one closer to my place, and yet, perhaps its good it's so far away...

Needless to say, I might have been full before the ice cream, but I was bursting after. It was a pleasant day. I will never eat Baskin Robbins again.
