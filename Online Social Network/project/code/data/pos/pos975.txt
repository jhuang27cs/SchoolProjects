Every time I go, they actually surprise me with how good their food is.  This place makes all of those "fast-casual" soup/salad/sandwich chains look pathetic.  I think I tend to forget that this isn't really all that comparable to Panera except that I can order the same style of food here for the same price.

Order at the register, they'll give you a number and deliver it to you.  Sometimes the fans in this place are on full blast, so unless you want to have windblown victoria's secret swimsuit model hair while you eat, pick your table wisely!

Everything I've had tastes truly fresh.  Some of the more creative things on the menu have great flavor profiles too!  Even though it is made for you after you order, they get things out to you fairly quickly.

Parking is free for an hour, so that's a plus.
