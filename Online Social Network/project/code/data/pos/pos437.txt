I had heard great things and convinced some friends to try on a sun drenched summer afternoon. Their cocktail list looked pretty epic - I decided on a non alcoholic bevvie that had plenty of flavor - house made ginger beer! Which tasted exactly like, ginger! Really refreshing - although I was surprised that I liked my friends peanut drink more. I tried the Jamaican jerk chicken which the sauce had lots of flavor - sadly, the chicken not as much. My Friend tried the specialty - and we tried both breads with the chicken curries and I would recommend those over the jerk chicken.  Would like to come back and try more of the menu - lots of veggie and vegan options!
