Best. Burger. Ever. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the atmosphere was a tad too stuffy for me. They pride themselves on great service and you definitely get that, but sometimes a too attentive staff can be a turn-off for me. I felt a little weird ordering the burger, but I had read such good reviews about their burger that I just had to try it. It literally melted in my mouth. I do wish it came with better fries (other than "shoe string fries") - how about sweet potato fries, no??? We ordered a tuna sashimi appetizer that was delicious - LOVE the spicy asian sauce layered underneath the sliced avocado. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion for the sashimi appetizer, then again it was approx $17 so maybe it was about right. Although pricey, the food is well worth the money. Even the bread basket was fantastic!
