They offer a buffet with pizza, salad, pasta, and desert. Soft drinks, with refill, are included. Plenty of pizza choices on the buffet. I did not find the pizza stale of left out when I went there.  People were eating them too fast for them to be anything but fresh. I think it really depends on the time of day you visit, for what you will find.  IF it is at Lunch or Dinner, then it will be fresh.

If you don't care for the buffet, order a whole pizza to go or eat in. Not the best pizza in the Bay Area, but it is really good and filling and made fresh. It is a good choice for a fairly quick meal in the UC Berkeley area.
