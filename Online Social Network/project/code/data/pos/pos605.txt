So I found this place thanks to a former fling from Harvard who insisted on us meeting here for a beer. A couple of weeks later, I ditched the dude but kept this little gem of a place. Since my best friend/tutor lives in Porter, and I live in Kendall, this was a good meeting place for us to work on homework together. And working on homework over a nice (cheap) pint of beer can't get any better. 

The waiters/bartenders are friendly enough. The food is just pub food, but they have half-price food between 5:30 and 7:30 and then later at night again (I think). So that works pretty well.
