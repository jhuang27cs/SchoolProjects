Even though Zifty adds a fee on top of the dishes offered, it has been heaven sent for our our project team this week- as we used them 3 of the 4 nights we stayed late working. 

The only thing I would mention is that it takes 1.5 hours to have your food delivered (and you have to order by 9 PM) so be prepared but both of the delivery people were extremely nice and our food was handled with care. 

If a group of people ever find themselves at the office late and at the office (and not wanting to run out), I would definitely recommend hitting up this place.
