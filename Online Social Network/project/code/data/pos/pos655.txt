First time at West Egg this past Sunday. We waited about 50 minutes or so. No problem for me...I realize this is Atlanta and there are 5 million people here. You most likely will have to wait for a table on a Friday or Saturday night or for brunch on the weekend. Get over it. Chill. Everyone is fighting for the same 25 tables. 

The waitress was slow but very friendly. I didn't mind the slowness because her attitude rocked. I kinda liked the laid-back-ness of it.

The food was delicious. Poached egg done perfectly. I would slap my mama for the banana bread French toast. Wow! 

All in all a great way to spend some time on a lazy Sunday.
