Let me say that I have never been to Chicago, so I don't know how it's supposed to taste, but I do know how it is supposed to be prepared.
Deep dish, thick crust, all the toppings, then sauce poured all over the top.  Also, this is the kind of pizza that must be eaten with a fork and spoon.
This was the first time I've had chicago style pizza and it was delicious.  Especially when paired with a beer that the guy with an awesome mustache recommended.
