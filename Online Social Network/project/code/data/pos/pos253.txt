One of my faves in downtown claremont. Its healthy, refreshing, and flavorful. You can order on the phone and pick it up to go if you're in a rush. The place is small and has 7 tables tops with booths and chairs. It's affordable but a little bit on the pricey side. The menu is broken up by sides, proteins, and sauces. If they didn't close so early I would eat there after work all the time! 

Their salmon is delicious! You have to get it with steamed vegetables, basmati rice, and the apple aoli sauce! The sauce is sooooo good! 

Their blackened chicken is juicy and flavorful. They have a mustard sauce that goes w this or you can choose one of their lemon sauces! 

I love their pasta sald with balsamic vinegar and cherry tomatoes! This place is very good!!! Yay for D. Grubbs!
