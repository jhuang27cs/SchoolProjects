Yay for the Motley! I'm not a big coffee drinker so I must admit that I mostly come here for snacks (and maybe some tea).

I'm not a vegan but DAMN those homemade, vegan chocolate chip cookies that they sell are absolutely divine, especially if you can get them right after they're delivered so that they're fresh-baked and still a little warm and gooey. Mmmmm....

The breakfast burritos also hit the spot.

I guess the only complaint I have about the Motley is that there's always a looong line in between class periods. Oftentimes I try to stop by for a jolt of caffine or a tasty treat on my way to class and I end up standing in line for several minutes before I decide that I'd better get going or else I'll be late. This is not the fault of any of the ladies behind the counter - they're working their asses off - but is really just a product of the Motley being so popular. Maybe it's time to expand?

Oh yeah, and I wish people would do a better job of tidying up when they leave the Motley. There are always magazines and newspapers strewn all over the place, making it kinda hard to find the thing you're looking for. So clean up after yourselves, people!
