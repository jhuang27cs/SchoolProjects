WHen I moved to LA almost a year ago, one of the hardest things for me to get accustomed to was that there wasn't a Target right down the street. However, with the opening of City Target this past week - there now is! And I am happy!

I've checked this place out a couple times so far and it's definitely a nice to have! 

I'm happy I live walking distance. I have driven twice - but the parking garage isn't huge. It's also shared with Ralph's, so it's crowded. Once a new store moves in to where Best Buy was, I can see this lot becoming  a mini nightmare. There's an upper and lower lot; I personally prefer the upper... but park where ever you can. If they're full, signs will be out and you'll have to street park.

OK- enough about parking. Like a few other reviews noted, I thought prices were slightly higher here than at the larger stores.. Maybe around 30 cents - $1.50. Not a huge deal if you're buying one or two things, but if I'm going to go for a major shop, I'll likely still drive to another Target.

Lots of staff on hand this week who are helpful at advising where things are. So far - a great addition to the neighborhood.
