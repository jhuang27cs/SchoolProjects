I am a really big fan of restaurants where its a hands on experience. 

I would suggest not eating lunch before you go. I liked the fact that it wasn't like other Brazilian barbecue places I've been to before, I was impressed mostly by the variety of meats and how fresh it was (right off the grill) to your table. I found that the salad bar was really good as well lots of variety off from traditional Brazilian types of food,This place is definitely a Brazilian/ French fusion restaurant.  In this day and age I think having fresh ideas like Pampa's, is a great way to go. 

Everything I had was exceptionally good, the fillet mignon, was either garlic and herb or Parmesan. The chicken hearts  had a strong Madeira taste, the skirt steak and tri tip embodied traditional flavors of the flame, and was even better with the chimchurri , the lamb came with a balsamic reduction which I thought was absolutely delicious, the tabouli and coconut sweet potato puree was excellent, the wide variety of cheeses complimented my wine, and the service... I loved the service, everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive. 

So if you're looking for something different, a little off the beaten path of traditional Brazilian restaurants and you like  to have cheese with your wine before your meal like I do, then I would check this place out.
