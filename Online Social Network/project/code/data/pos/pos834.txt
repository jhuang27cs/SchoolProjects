I have been trying to get to BerryLine ever since they opened, almost two years ago. My coworkers and I took a lunch break trip to BerryLine back in June and we have been addicted ever since! The first trip one of my colleagues helped herself to seconds because she loved the first one so much! Ever since that fateful day I get a medium instead of a small because it makes my belly very happy, I just "suffer" through the fullness. 
I love all of the toppings that they have! The fruit is so fresh and beautiful! You can't go wrong with one of their candies/cookies either. I recently had frozen yogurt at a new yogurt place in Boston, by MGH, and it was a poor attempt at the BerryLine original flavor. It appears that no one can match the natural, tart yogurt taste that BerryLine has achieved. I haven't been able to try one of their flavored yogurts yet, I enjoy the original too much to venture! 
I am typically an ice cream fanatic but I feel that my life is now complete thanks to BerryLine's healthy option over my ice cream. I'll give up the ice cream any day for this yogurt!
