Very professional and sterile. 

I wanted a nape piercing, so I made an appointment and Jef did the piercing for me. He is very relaxed and precise, explained each step to me as he went along, and before I knew it I was good to go!  I made an appointment for another one a few months later, but someone else pierced me and, unfortunately, it didn't line up with my first piercing. Once I realized this, I went back in to talk to Jef. He agreed that it was crooked to the first one, took it out, made an appointment for 4 days later, and re-pierced it. It came out great. Lining up nape piercings is tricky business, so I didn't blame them for that little mishap. Plus, they were so great about fixing it up for me!  

I recommend them to everyone who is interested in piercings.
