The food is great, especially the sauces (white wine mussels!). Also, the avocado bacon, cucumber appy is amazing. As are the cocktails - they're small but so tasty! The waiting staff seems to be a good team.

The only complaints are the noise (it's always loud) and the burger-type food is not great.
