Blimpy Burger is simply a classic Ann Arbor kind of place.  Anyone that goes to U of M or is visiting Ann Arbor had to go to Blimpy.  The burgers are absolutely amazing and very unique.  Here, a single patty is only about half the size of our standard burger patty, so when you order a triple or quad you definitely don't have to feel out of place.  My personal favorite is a triple (or quad if I'm extra hungry) with bacon and egg!  Make sure you either know how to order or read the chalkboard on how to beforehand or else the cook will probably snap at you...it's just the character of the place. I love it here!
