I really, really wish I could give this place a 5, but anyone who has been to a real club such as Mansion in Miami will realize that no club in Boston deserves 5 stars.  However, for a club of its type, which is small and hip, it really does the job great.  I almost missed Middlesex the first time around, as the front looks like a closed-down storefront.  Once you get in though it is great.  The girls are hot and not trashy, which is key.  Secondly, the bartenders aren't rude, but they do discriminate - hot females and hot males get served first.  As someone with average looks this upsets me, but the club makes up for this with its great vibe, and great people.  The music is good, and the bouncers don't go overboard.  One problem you might encounter are small packs of alpha-males who are on "chick-finding" missions, and act rude to everybody in their quest to do this.  Anyway, check this place out, its a blast and the best nightlife you can get in Boston.  Even better, good late-night pizza is right around the corner.
