Sooo Yummy! My friend and I stopped in at the new Thai Spice on the drag and were really surprised! The pad thai was really good but so was the sushi and the happy hour special! It was also really affordable and you get a good amount of food for what you pay. Definitely coming back to this trendy little place.
