Gud breakfast everytime!!! On My first time here I tried their farmers omelette and blueberry muffin...Awesome!! The omelette was with ham but they agreed to accommodate only veggies option for me. The server was very cheerful and didn't push us to order a lot of food when asked for recommendation. The farmers omelette includes their yummy red roasted potatoes so u don't have to order a side of it. 
Overall, quick service n great food. They also have a big salad bar  with fresh veggies n fruits. They have servers everyday until 11am M-F i believe for breakfast seating and after that it's all self service and order at the register. 
Gud place , I'll be here again for those yum yum roasted potatoes!!!!!
