I am a little leery of buffets in general, but I really thought that the lunch buffet at Café of India was quite good.  It was larger than others I have been to with nice variety and interesting dishes.  

If anything I thought that the service was a little too attentive with a server bringing our check before we'd finished and assuming I'd placed payment in it when I hadn't gotten to it yet.  To his credit he seemed embarrassed and assured us we could take our time.  I liked the decor and ambiance at Café of India, and the price was very reasonable.
