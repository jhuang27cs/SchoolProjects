I think this is a first of it's kind of truck?  Please excuse me if I'm wrong.  But this was a great idea to nab a restaurant on wheels and serve up tasty, sweet, succulent lobster out of the back.  I got the Lobster Roll (of course!) and it was decently priced, although I wouldn't spend that much on lunch everyday.

My friend and I had downed our lobster rolls before our third friend had ordered and recieved their food from the neighboring food truck.   It was that GOOD!
