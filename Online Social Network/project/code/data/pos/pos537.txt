I had my optical drive fail along with my hard drive.  Needless to say I was upset my business files were one that computer. These guys were awesome not only did they fix my MAC and clean it up.  They called to give me updates, explained it all and after four days of retrieving data and dealing with me they only charged me for one and a half hours of work. They are pleasant, easy going and smart-what more could I ask for.  Dont bring your MAC anywhere else these guys are amazing.  great customer service, pleasant owners and fair prices-yes this is a great business.
