This is my kind of place! Run by super friendly people and serving up some pretty delicious food.

We walked in, and were instantly greeted by the owner and what I'm assuming was his wife(?). Both were incredibly welcoming. Upon hearing that it was our first visit, he walked us through a sampling of all of their homemade sauces and explained each. Perhaps we were there at a slower time, but it was great to have a nice conversation with the owner. He discussed his cooking methods and preferences for BBQ. He even let us try the black-eyed peas and collard greens - both were good...and both were vegan, which was a nice surprise for anyone perhaps looking for vegan options (they also have BBQ tofu options).

My wife and I walked out of YinzBurgh with chicken, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, collard greens, mac & cheese, and cole slaw; a decent sampling, to say the least.

Overall, I really can't complain about anything. The pulled pork was excellent, the brisket was good (though maybe slightly dry), and the ribs were good. Note, that this isn't the type of BBQ that comes smothered in sauce, and honestly, you don't need much sauce - if any - to enjoy.

Add in the fact that all of the sides were good, and it's hard to provide any reasons not to go back next time we're in a BBQ mood!
