Rynae has been cutting my hair for over 12 years, and she is the best.  Value for money, hands down, World Cuts is the place to get your hair cut for under $20.  There's nothing cheap about the quality or breadth of services, it's really only the cost that she keeps low.  

Rynae is one of the friendliest business owners you'll ever meet, and she always makes time for anyone who steps foot in her salon.  

This place gets busy though (with reason), so I'd recommend coming in no later than 11AM Mon - Sat if you want to avoid the wait.  

As a bonus - she validates parking in the nearby lot on Durant, so no need to circle around looking for street spots ever...
