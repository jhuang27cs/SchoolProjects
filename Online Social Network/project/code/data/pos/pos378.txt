amazing bbq- maybe it's bc i've never had it done right - texas style, that is.

the ribs were lean, but not so lean that it's dry. the brisket was good too, but  a distant second to the ribs. 
and, the cole slaw and potato salad (you get two sides with a 2 combo plate) are a PERFECT accompaniment to the meat. 

grab a beer (they'll give you a frozen mug to pour it in), add a pecan pie (legendary i tell ya), and bring it to the checkered tables outside and you're set. 
God I'm gonna miss this place..

goode company also does seafood, american, and mexican in other locations...
