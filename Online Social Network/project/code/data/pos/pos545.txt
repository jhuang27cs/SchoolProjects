We we're downtown wasting some time... we came across No Thai and well the fact is, I LOVE Thai and cannot get enough of it.  We had some time and were feeling peckish if not full on hungry, so my boyfriend and I ducked in to check it out and grab some food.  

We ordered the tofu drunken noodles to split.  #1 It was incredibly fast.  I was shocked, I got the fast-food feeling of the place when we walked in, but this was lightening fast.  Right on.  #2 it was reasonably good.  Yes, I've had better, but it wasn't bad in the least.  #3 my boyfriend is embarrassing sometimes and after shoveling-food-into-mouth-eating he will lick his place.  It wasn't bad food!  I'd say it was pretty good, he'd agree but his mouth is full. 

Totally worth trying in the least!
