I tried out Antico Pizza based upon an article I read on Sky Miles magazine wherein Antico was highlighted. Upon my first bite of this pizza, I was hooked and wanted to come back again for every single meal I had while at Atlanta. 

Never in my wildest dreams I would have the best and most authentic Italian pizza in Southern America. I highly recommended anyone visitng or living in the Atlanta area and farther out to come to Anitco Pizza. It's only a matter of time before Antico will be shown on those tourists shows on the Travel Channel and the Food Network.
