I am a huge fan of lunch from Le Dog.  If you work anywhere near downtown it is  an easy walk and well worth it.  In the winter, the hot soups can warm a gloomy Michigan day better than any other lunch in the area.  In the summer, the cold soups are refreshing and well flavored.

I do have to admit, I have never tried a dog there - and it is my understanding that Le Dog started out mainly serving hot dogs.
