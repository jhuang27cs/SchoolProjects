Ambiance 4/5
DAMN this place is small so obviously you have to wait for a table, so it depends on how fast people eat. Get ready to see a shit ton of UCLA fans since the Rose Bowl is around the corner. Expect to be kind of cramped so if your claustrophobic, suck it up. If you don't mind sitting next to strangers, asking them to pass the salt, than you will fit right in

Food 4/5
My friends and I ordered 3 different pizzas to try, they even allowed us to do half on the toppings. The waiter brought out some rolls which were good, I think we ordered another batch because they were that good, can't remember all the different types of pizzas we got, except the best one which had spinach on it, that thing was beast

Service 4/5
It's pretty hard to not get their attention with the place being so small, if you don't, sucks for you. But the waiters were cool, they work fast, made some recommendations, refilled our drinks before they got empty, pretty straight forward service imo.

12/15...next time I gotta try their pasta
