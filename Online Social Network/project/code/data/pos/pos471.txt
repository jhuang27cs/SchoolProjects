Great place to go for interesting decor, good conversation, drinks and a meal.  The old train cars are really well-decorated and the staff is really friendly.  I took a friend who was visiting from out of town and she was really entertained by the place.  Even the bathrooms are decorated from floor to ceiling with old posters, ads, and magazine covers from the 40s-60s.  

The spinach and artichoke dip was divine!  Bellinis were yummy and very appropriate for our girls' lunch.  She had the chicken sandwich and ate every last morsel.  I had the portobello mushroom sandwich with a side salad and was very happy with my selection.  We just couldn't fathom dessert with all the food we had scarfed down.

I will DEFINITELY be back!
