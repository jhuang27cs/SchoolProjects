Grendel's is one of my go-to lunchtime spots in Harvard Square. First of all, it's crazy cheap. Like, eat-a-whole-meal-for-less-than-five-bucks cheap. The food isn't breaking down culinary barriers or anything, but it is definitely tasty. The sandwiches are especially good -- my favorites are the Grendel (roast beef with boursin cheese) and the French dip. Everything comes out super quickly; I don't think I've ever waited longer than 10 minutes for my food to arrive. I never have to worry that I won't make it back to the office in time when I come to Grendel's. 

The service is solid. Grendel's isn't the kind of place where your waiter is going to fawn over you and make tons of idle chatter, but every server I've had has been pleasant and accommodating. I once asked for steamed veggies (not on the menu) instead of the standard potato chips with my sandwich, and the server didn't even bat an eye. I wasn't charged extra either, which was a nice surprise. If you're pressed for time and are looking for cheap eats in the square, give Grendel's a chance.
