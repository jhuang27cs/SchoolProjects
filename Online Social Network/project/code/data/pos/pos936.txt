Yeah, this place rules. I'm not always in the mood for it... but when I'm in the mood for a good burger, I could almost always go for Bobby's.

Tried almost every burger on their menu (gluttonous, I know) and some rate much higher than others, but they are all pretty darn good.

Not as greasy or heavy feeling as some of the other burger-joint models, and a lot more options if you want a different burger. A consistent burger that doesn't fall apart and from my experience is rarely over or under-cooked... in other words, I think they might actually train their cooks how to cook a burger. The sweet potato fries are awesome, regular fries are good too, and there are a plethora of different sauces to try for dipping/topping.

Also... get it Crunchified. You won't regret it.
