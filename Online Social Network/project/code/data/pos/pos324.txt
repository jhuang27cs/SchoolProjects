Easily my favorite pizza joint in La Jolla.  It's a locally owned restaurant, and tons of students and residents come here.  It's a good place to grab some food if you're on the run (i.e. quick bite before a night of endless drinking?  haha - the good old days) 

Their Chicago deep dish pizzas are delicious!  The portions are pretty big and definitely satisfying.  

My personal favorites:
- Sopressata pizza
- Meat lovers deep dish pizza
- Homemade minestrone soup  
- Rigatoni chicken pesto pasta
- Tiramisu! (although I'm not sure if they actually MAKE it at the restaurant)
- Cannoli!!  (super yummy)

Outdoor seating is available too!

One thing I'm not too crazy about - the pizzas can get pretty oily.. runny oily.. which can be pretty gross..
