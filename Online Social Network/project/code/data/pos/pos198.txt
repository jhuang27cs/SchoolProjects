The Harvard Book Store is excellent.  They have a massive selection of almost every kind of book.  I particularly enjoy their art and architecture sections which provides a decent  assortment of titles.  And don't forget the used book and remainder section downstairs!  Pretty good selection there as well and it will save you a bunch of money.

Watch out for the fact that the used book portion in the basement has different hours than the regular store.
