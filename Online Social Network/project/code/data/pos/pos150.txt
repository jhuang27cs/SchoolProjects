I found out that this place recently remodeled so I tried it today.  Normally, I go to the one in Stanford.  I really like what they did with the place. It's very relaxing and pretty.

I had a massage with Dorothy.  I gotta say that she worked wonders with knots.  She has really strong good hands and adjusted pressure as I requested.
