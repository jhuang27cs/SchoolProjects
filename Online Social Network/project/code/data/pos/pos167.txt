I stopped in for a quick bite and a brew and was not disappointed.  They have about 20 or so drafts on tap and a laundry list of great beers in a bottle.  When I say great beers, I am talking about often hard to find microbrews from across the country.  I had a spicy lamb burger with fries with my beer and it was gone in seconds.  Delicious.
