The outside (rooftop) was too crowded for us to get an open table. But, the college basketball pictures are awesome indoors and really set the atmosphere. Much of our meal conversation was on Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins, Dean Smith, and such. My River and Range burger (burger topped with smoke salmon) along with beer-battered fries was effing delicious. I also enjoyed the blueberry wheat beer (which they drop blueberries into). Mmmm. The service however was utterly egregious. Our waiter must have had some rare form of amnesia, he forget several things: the lemons we asked for in our waters, the ketchup. Funny enough, he even forgot to add on the Arnold Palmer that my friend Dan ordered, so the bill was cheaper than it should have been. Maybe the bad service was a good thing after all.
