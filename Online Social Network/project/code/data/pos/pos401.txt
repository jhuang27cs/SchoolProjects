Based solely on their gyros: 5 stars.  Absolutely delicious.  Not too much sauce, succulent meat, crisp onions, tomatoes, all on fluffy, chewa pita bread.  I am wowed by the fact that you can choose your size of gyro.  I think a medium gyro (4oz) is perfect for filling you up without overwhelming your stomach.  AND, it's under $5.  Yum, yum, yum.
