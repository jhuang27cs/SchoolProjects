I've been getting stuff embroidered here for a few years now, and the service, quality, and pricing are all worth 5 stars! The owners of Joy's are this cute Korean couple who are very very friendly, and they understand exactly what I want to get done without much explanation. They even take into consideration what "looks good" as well, instead of just "doing it". They are quite speedy too! All in all, I'd highly recommend Joy's for its low prices and great quality and service!
