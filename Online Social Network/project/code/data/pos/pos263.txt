I ran through the front doors.. did some unnecessary weaving through ticket line ropes.. and arrived at the concession stand out of breath despite the fact that I covered less than a 1/3 of a city block. Must have been the adrenaline.

Me: There's a.. a.. fire outside!!!
Concession girl/lady/person: Someone's taking care of it. 
Me: Uh.. okay.. because it's getting kind of big. 
C G/L/P *turns to customer*: So do you want a medium or large?

I had been waiting for a friend when some girl threw her cig into the mulch outside of the theater. That was a bad idea... but more so since it was dry August day. An older gentleman noticed the small fire first and tried to put it out with his wing tipped shoe. Yeah, didn't help. Then an employee came out with a small glass of water and thought he quelched the flames. When he left the fire was as big as a small bush. Big enough for me to go Moses on it and ask it for the 10 Commandments of Movie Theaters (#2 - Don't throw your cigs into mulch, stupidhead). Or something. That's when I ran in. As I walked out defeated, an employee leisurely came out with a bucket of water. 

So anyway. I like Kendall. The staff sometimes leads me to believe that their corporate trainer was Thora Birch's character in Ghost World.. but I like me some quirky workers. This is the place to go for indie movies. Sign up for their mailing list. They're constantly giving away free tickets/posters/etc and announcing special events/screenings. One of the last shows I saw, they had the director there for questions afterwards. OOhh.. and snacks! You can throw different kinds of flavoring on the popcorn. Way to rock. I also like the sassy sign in the bathroom next to the Excelisor dryers saying that they KNOW they're loud...so deal. Very well kept and clean!
