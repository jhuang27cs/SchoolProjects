I would give Esselon 10 stars if I could. I'm officially obsessed. Its one of the biggest things I miss about living in western MA. No matter how long I'm home for, I always take time for a visit. 

I love the cozy feel and decor, especially the awesome cieling. But the food and coffee is seriously incredible. I love the speciality pancakes--they're always so mouth-watering and delicious. I usually end up getting the breakfast burrito though. Its been amazing every single time I've gotten it. And i have to get a cookie to go. It keeps the Esselon yummy-ness alive even when I'm back in the city.
