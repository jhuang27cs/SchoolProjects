The bubble tea here is divine, every incarnation.  I have become thoroughly addicted to the Chrysanthemum tea (I order it less sweet, pearls, no milk), Singing Bird, Naughty Squirrel, and Ginger Peach teas. My kids love the Taro and Honeydew.  

I'm not quite up to the store's motto, which is something like:   If you come to my home and I am not here, I am at Momoko - if I am not at Momoko, I am on my way to Momoko" but I'm not that far off... 

I don't bother with bubble tea anywhere else. I might deign to have a smoothie or something somewhere else, but Momoko's teas are outrageously, incomparably good.  

The owner and staff are all very, very sweet and get to know your preferences.  And one of the great pleasures of the place is reading the menu and making your selection. Iri, the owner, writes all the descriptions, and they make for awfully entertaining reading. 

It's a fun place with kids as long as you can trust them not to pick up every interesting thing they see, as the shop is chock-full of amazing Japanese tchochkes and T-shirts. We pick up our monthly supply of Pocky there, too; and you can also get amazing flowers from Floral DJ, which bases itself out of the store.  Kate Ko is their designer, and she's very, very creative when she gets to work outside the FTD book.
