My wife and I had the pleasure of dinner and a show and let me tell you, WOW! The service is top notch, food selection is good (even for the vegiterians), drinks are good too. The performers are wonderful, I have seen CATS at the Pantages and is was good, however the Candlelight Pavilion took  a step further by bringing the show up close and personal. The schedule changes so check the web. I will definitely be coming back for more.
