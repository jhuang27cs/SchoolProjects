I went back to Pittsburgh recently and went out of my way to come here (again)! Even during the high Friday night crowd, they were able to seat a group of 6 within 5 minutes. Of course, I had a coconut martini, which was as delicious as I remembered! I tried the pumpkin curry with tofu; it was AMAZING! The pumpkin and tofu were perfectly cooked! 

Hats off to you, Bangkok Balcony!
