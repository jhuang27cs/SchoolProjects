For the past year, when family and friends come to visit ATL I'm always sure to bring them to Bab's for lunch.  I love the atmosphere and yummy chicken and brie panini with sweet potato fries done just right with a good dipping sauce and in the summer they'll serve up a thirst quenching champagne cocktail with strawberries, blueberries, and lime and lemon zests that always hits the spot. 

I never have to wait for a table and there is always a spot to park for free (huge plus!).  And I love being greeted by all of the guys when I walk through the door.  The service is always quick and delicious and Randy and the guys are a hoot!
