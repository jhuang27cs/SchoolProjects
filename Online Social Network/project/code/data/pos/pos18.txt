We were served sweet biscuits after we ordered two of the Fried Shrimp Po' Boys and sipped on our Red Stripes.  

The Po' Boys were served a big roll with tasty  fries on the side (Good sized portions). I enjoyed both the sweet and peppery BBQ sauces on each of the tables.  

I liked my experience at Rack & Soul, my only complaints are it's a bit pricey and it took over a week for my transaction to clear on my debit card... I don't know what was up with that.
