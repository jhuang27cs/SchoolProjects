Yum yum yums! Deliciousness in my tums!

Bongo burger is delicious, and I'm salivating just thinking about my next burger. I usually get the Black Bean burger or the Persian Sandwich, simply because I no longer eat beef. Both are delicious, and as well as all the beef ones (well, the ones that I tried before I gave up beef.). However, at this point, I almost religiously always get the Persian Sandwich. Can't really go wrong with lamb.

But honestly, it's not the sandwiches that captivate me. It's the fries. I know wavy fries are one of the lowest on the fry scale (with criss-cut/waffle fries at the very top), but for some reason, Bongo makes wavy fries like no other. They're perfect, and everything wavy fries should be. Not to mention that they offer a ranch dipping sauce, which is better than crack cocaine (it's a metaphor! i honestly wouldn't know). I usually need about 3.5 portions of ranch, 2 for my sandwich, and 1.5 for my fries. *licks lips*

Bongo makes me happy. I mean, I think I prefer the Northside and Westside stores over the Southside one (Southside wins only due to proximity). It's location next to People's Park has made it an interesting journey on several occasions. However, one of the conviences of the Southside location, it offers a huge table. Good for groups of 6!
