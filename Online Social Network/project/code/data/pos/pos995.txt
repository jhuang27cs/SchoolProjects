I came here to The Counter for lunch with my girlfriend today. It was around 1pm so the lunch crowd was leaving and we got a table right away. I have never been there before so they told me how to order my burger and such. I chose the beef burger, 2/3 pound, on a bun, Cheddar cheese, with pickles, lettuce, pineapple, and red onion, and the sweet BBQ sauce. 

When you order you get to choose from different things. The different proteins you get to choose from is beef, turkey, chicken, and one other one. Then you get to choose how much meat you want. Either 1/3, 2/3 or one pound. Then 4 different toppings, a sauce, a cheese, on a bun or salad. it's pretty much make it your way. 

Also with my burger i got an order of sweet potato fries and a strawberry milk shake. The sweet potato fries were good and it came with horseradish mustard dipping sauce that i didn't care too much for. 

The service was good, but sometimes the servers stay at other tables too long because people do not know what they want to get. It took me a while to get a box and the check. 

You can eat inside or out. I did not get a chance to see the inside because i sat outside. It was really clean out side so i could imagine the inside. Overall it was pretty good.
