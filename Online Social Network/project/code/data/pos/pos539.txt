Dining here was truly a wonderful experience. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, like you're going over someone's house for an intimate dinner party. My boyfriend and I shared 6 small plates, and the standout dishes were scallops and chicken, as well as the rhubarb tart. The homemade sodas were great as well. We asked a lot of questions about the menu and our server was very helpful and patient. Everything about Bondir is well thought out, from the lighting to the plates to the food. This restaurant is truly special.
