I've had food from here so many times in the last few years-- time to give Hummus some Yelp love. I'm sitting at the counter just inside the store right now, enjoying a stellar grilled veggie platter. Everything in front of me is so, SO on point. Perfect tabouli-- the bulgur still has some tooth and it's not drowning in lemon. Rice so fluffy and buttery I can't/don't want to stop shoveling it into my face. Crisp, spicy hot peppers and tart pickles. Fresh, well-seasoned veggies, warm whole wheat pita, and, of course, gorgeous, creamy hummus. I really could not ask for more out of this lunch. 

This isn't just a fluke. Hummus delivers consistently fresh, solid food I can feel good about eating. And the service is AWESOME. Love this place and I'll keep coming back.
