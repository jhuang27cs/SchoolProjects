Eff it. I know it's a truck and it doesn't have like, tables or... an address but this place really is great! Fresh ingredients, homemade baked goods and creative combinations make the walk over to this foodtruck worthwhile.

This is not one of those places (like Grasshopper in Allston) that exploit the fact that most vegetarians are effing starving and will eat whatever garbage you tell them is vegan.  These guys make stuff that tastes good to all people, vegans and omnivores alike.

Give this place a try sometime if you are getting bored of whatever random thing you usually get at the Kendall food court.  Try a chick pea fritter sandwhich and a rosemary french fries.
