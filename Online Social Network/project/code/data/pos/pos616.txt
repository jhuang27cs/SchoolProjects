This place was recommended by a real carolinian, and he was not wrong. We had breakfast here (brunch, really) and it was good. Generally, diner food is greasy enough that my stomach roils afterwards (although it doesn't stop me). Here, though, even the order of corned beef hash was almost...fluffy instead of being soaked through with oil. 
The french toast was also good-- they used a baguette as the base, and it was really light and soft. 
The coffee wasn't anything to write home about, but it was refilled enough times to keep me happy. I will definitely be coming back for non-greasy diner food.
