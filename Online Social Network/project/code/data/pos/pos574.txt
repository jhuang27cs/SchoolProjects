I'm not sure anything I say can be as positive as what's already been said by prior reviews. If you're into hats, this is the place to be. Awesome selection, super friendly and helpful staff helped the princess and I into the perfect caps. Whether its flat caps, fedoras, knits, skullies, bell caps, and bowlers this place has it all. Hand made super quality. 
  I bit on the Giltycity.com app when it came around, and had the pleasure of strolling into the Harvard square shop where at once the princess and I were captivated by the staff and selection. Will return and hope to see you there!
