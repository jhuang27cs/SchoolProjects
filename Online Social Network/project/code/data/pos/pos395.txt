Strangely, I haven't been to the actual Yoga Studio at Karma, but if I ever were looking for a really great studio for yoga and pilates, this definitely looks like somewhere I'd like to go.

What I'm mostly reviewing is the tea shop part of this place. The decor is really nice, modern without feeling cold, it is very appropriately zen-like and I like the wide, airy space that is full of light. You get a lovely whiff of the tea scents as soon as you walk in the door, and it's somewhere I feel very peaceful. They sell so many organic and vegan products, and the teas (all loose-leaf) are quite yummy. The almond iced tea didn't taste very strongly of almond, but it was pretty good all the same, and had a good tea flavour without being overwhelmingly strong - basically, it was brewed very well.

The staff are really sweet and friendly, and I really like how they give 100% of the profits they make from use cow's milk in a product go to charity and for the better treatment of animals. Of course, you'd have to get cow's milk in your drink to help, but generally this place really seems to care about the well-being of animals. This is evident from the numerous flyers they have about the charitable ventures, animal adoption information and non-profit programs for the betterment of animal treatment that they support or recommend. Put simply, they really seem to care, and that's great. :) And the tea isn't half bad!
