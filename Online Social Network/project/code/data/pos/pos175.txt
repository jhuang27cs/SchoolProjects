Sunday Brunch:

I went it at 10am (when it opens). There was only one other group there at the time so seating wasn't an issue. The place seems to be fairly low key Sunday mornings (or at least this morning). Waiter was awesome; very friendly and attentive. The layout is pretty open so even on a full day it wouldn't be crammed (common complaint for some brunch places).   

I ordered the Go Green! egg-white Scramble (basil-marinated portobella / fried green tomatoes / fresh mozzarella / basil cashew pesto) and my friend got the Kathy Bates Bennie (Eggs benedict that consists of 2 crispy oat waffles, fried green tomatoes, poached eggs,  hollandaise-of course-and avocado smash). Portions were very generous. Eating buddy loved his eggs benedict. I had a bite myself and they were yummy. I liked my scramble as well. Sweet potato latkas were good; very comfort food-like. My only critique was the amount of liquid in my plate. I'm guessing cooking with that much veggies, some fluid comes out but it made the eggs a little wetter than I would have liked (mostly an issue towards the end of the meal). It was all still delicious but definitely would have liked less water. The excess water could have also accounted for the egg tasting a bit bland. To be fair, I love salty so I am very sensitive to food that is under-salted even a tad. 

Anyway I would certainly come back! I really would like to try a waffle next time (got my eye on the sweet cinnamon waffle with nutella ice cream). We both enjoyed our brunch and its very chill ambiance provided an ideal place for my college friend and I to catch up on life.
