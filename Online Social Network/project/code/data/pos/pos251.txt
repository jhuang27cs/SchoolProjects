I love this place.  Authentic Greek cuisine at a decent price.  Chefs prepare all dishes just like they do in Athens, Mykonos, and Santorini.  Mythos, Greek beer, complements all the entrees.  Good for groups.  Crazy to read menu.  Tasso was such a great waiter - very welcoming. He's such a nice guy and will make anyone feel right at home with his conversation.  Go here and Go Greek!
