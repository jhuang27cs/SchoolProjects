Ah, Bandido's... light of my Mexican life.  I've been going here since I first moved to Chapel Hill, and it's an absolute staple of life on or around campus.

It's a tiny hole in the wall place, kind of a cave, really (If you're tall, remember to duck when entering the main dining room).  The ambiance is fantastic, everything bright and gaudy and ridiculous, but very charming.

Starting out with the complimentary chips and salsa is neat, mainly because there's a do-it-yourself salsa bar so everyone can pick their favorite from a half-dozen types of salsa.  I usually go for the enchiladas, which are excellent.

A couple people I know complain that the food here is "soupy," which is fair to an extent.  Occasionally everything will come out of as a shapeless mass of cheese and chicken so dense that light itself is trapped within.  That being said, things are hot and flavorful, everything that you'd really expect from low-class Mexican fare.

Beware El Gigante.  It will destroy you.

The service is adequate at best, but again, that's to be expected.  Look elsewhere for beer specials.  Pay in cash and they enter you in a drawing to earn free food.  If you're looking to save cash, go for the A la carte selections on the back of the menu... there's a decent amount of food there for very little coin.
