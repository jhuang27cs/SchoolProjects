If you have been to Benihana, than you really need to stop and come here.  Yes I've been to Chomp and no it's not even close.  Shoguns?  You can't tell but I am laughing at you. The only other place that edges this place out is Tsunami's in HB and it's because of the noodles they make!

Tokyo Kitchen is located in a very unassuming strip mall in "why the heck are we in Monclair?", CA.  There really isn't any other reason to visit this city.  Even the mall makes me think of the 80s and not in the awesome way.  

Anyway it's not a chain and I am pretty sure it is family owned.  The food is delicious and most of the chefs are actually still Japanese, go figure!

Their seasoned rice which comes with your meal is way better than steamed rice.  I have no idea what they do with it and if I didn't LOVE fresh made fried rice I would just stick with this any day.  

Your meal comes with lots of food, too much for one person really but it never feels heavy.  You start with soup and salad with ginger dressing(looks like barf to me but most people like it)  and you head on into dinner.  Your entree will afford you all of the following:

Shrimp app
rice
assorted veggies
two homemade and unmatched tasty sauces
and your protein

most entrees even include ice cream.  Green tea is still yummy all these years later.

They have a great sushi bar and their alcoholic drinks even have cool souvenir glasses.  I love it here, always have.

You need to go, you'll thank me once you forget about the traffic on the 10 freeway.
