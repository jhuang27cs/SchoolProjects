Wonderful!  My rear bumper was FULL of scrapes, dings, even a hole the size of a dime.  When someone backed into the corner of the bumper I took it in to have the crack and scrapes from that incident fixed.  When we picked up the car they had repaired the ENTIRE bumper for no extra charge.  It looks so great!  They were friendly and accommodated my busy work-travel schedule.

The work was done when they said it would be, looks perfect and the price could not be beat.  I will definitely go here again when I give in and decide to get my door dings fixed!
