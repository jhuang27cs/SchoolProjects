Zoe's is a great little brunch spot that does all the classics well (I'll have to make a return trip to try some of their Greek fare), filling you up for dirt cheap. Order the My 3 Sons breakfast and you'll get three eggs cooked any style, 3 pieces of bacon, 3 sausages, 3 pancakes (I opted  for the sweet potato ones which were just a tad bit dense for me), and the most delicious hash browns--all for $10. After a night of drunken debauchery (my new favorite phrase), that meal--which was delivered on two GIANT plates--was just what the doctor ordered.
