Concluded my week long stay in SD with two nights here. Alyssa was extremely helpful and answered any questions I had. The room was very spacious. They also honored my request to have extra pillows and towels there upon check in. Having 7 pillows on a king sized bed all to yourself is great! The small attention to detail--from the garage attendants addressing me by name, to when the bell desk employee gave me a shipping form when he saw that I was carrying a FedEx box, made for an enjoyable experience. You don't have to be an Elite member (which I found out I was to my surprise) to expect this type of treatment. The service from the staff here is impeccable. Love this hotel!
