I agree with Brittney M. on how hard it is to find a nail place in or near Shadyside. However Shadyside Nail Salon does good job though one of my gripes is that you have to find street parking.

The salon itself is clean and you don't typically wait that long. When you enter the store, you write your name and the services that you wish to receive. Nice selection of colors from brands like Essie and OPI. The staff is really friendly though english tends to not be their first language. Good job on manicures and pedicures, and reasonably priced though I am still on a quest to find a nail salon in the area for the same prices but with hot stone massages and paraffin treatment (I have been spoiled by Cali nail salons). Note that you should bring cash for tip.
