One of my favorite affordable Thai joints in town! My favorite dish here is the Pad Kee Mao. I'm pretty picky when it comes to the right squishiness of noodles but they've got it down pat.  As mentioned by countless others, be sure to come here for their happy-hour 6$ specials for (almost) all entrees with cash, which seems to be pretty much active all the time. It doesn't hurt that they've got a nice sense of decor and a chill music mix to give the right atmosphere.
