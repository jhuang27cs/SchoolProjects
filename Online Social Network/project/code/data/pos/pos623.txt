Best all-over Indian grocery in and around town that I've been able to find. They have an extensive section of fruits and vegetables that are hard to find in other grocery shops, a whole wall of freezers packed with a plethora of foods, and aisles of various dry goods. There is also an aisle endcap that houses a large amount of Indian desserts. As previously mentioned by other writers, parking can be tricky at times at this busy intersection.

Additionally, this shop has a hot food bar, where the items are supplied from India Garden restaurant. Food is spiced decently--about or just below medium I think. There are consistently 2 meat entrees and 4 veg entrees as well as rice. It is the cheapest meal in town that you can get, coming in at $3.99/lb. Samosas are also available for about $1.
