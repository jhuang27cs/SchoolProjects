Gaahh, just take my money already.

I almost don't want to post this review so people don't discover Berkeley Floor! I love, love, love this cafe. It's spacious, there's always been a table available when I go, and more importantly, the wifi works well and there are outlets accessible everywhere! This has definitely become my go-to place for studying near campus.

They offer pots of tea that I always see people drinking, and their salads are huge and definitely worth it. Try the tuna salad! They have a great selection of drinks and food. They even have a TV showing the latest sports game, but it is located in a spot where not everyone will be bothered if they're studying.

All in all, a great place that I hope doesn't change any time soon! Love it!
