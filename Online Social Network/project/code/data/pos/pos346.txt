I've lived near punjabi by nature for a while and I never took the time to try it out but I'm glad I finally did.

The first time I went here I figured they could justify such a cheap price for the buffet by charging for the naan. I was wrong, the naan is free unless you get the specialty naan, then it's a couple of bucks extra. 

The food here is pretty decent, not the best indian food but it's way decent for the price. I'm a huge fan of the zucchini and, of course, the tiki masala.  

The food's a little hit or miss with the rice sometimes being overcooked, but overall, it's a way decent meal for the price.
