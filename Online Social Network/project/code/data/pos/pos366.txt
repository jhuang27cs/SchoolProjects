Im in the quandry of finding a suit. Now I like the idea of getting dressed up, but I value comfort over aesthetics. I've quickly come to realize that it costs a lot of scratch to look good and be comfortable. Wanna know how Michael Weston and 007 make their way around, look stylish, and still feel great afterwards? Armani, Brioni and Zegna. The two Marks at N.M. showed me around what laying down a car downpayment (and possibly straight up the cost of an auto) could get you. I must say the Italians know what they're doing. But since I don't have an MI6 expense account, these will never be my every day wear. However consider me educated by the fine folks of N.M. on an eye opening tour of the finer things in clothing.
