Along with the Statue of Liberty, this place probably also gets filed under "New York Landmarks That Most New Yorkers Have Never Been To". But they should! Check out George Carlin's childhood neighborhood and see a true American hero's resting place. It is a very nice building and park, perfect for exploring on a nice day. Enjoy!

To hell with Robert E. Lee! General Grant is the man!
