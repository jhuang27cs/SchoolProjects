Miss Saigon 88 opened recently and it's a great addition to the food scene in North Oakland!  Located across from Tamarind of India, in the former space occupied by Johnny's Place, Miss Saigon 88 has done a very nice remodeling job inside and created a warm and welcoming environment.

So far I've only tried one entree for take out, but we can't wait to go back and try the wide variety of Pho and noodle soup dishes that are on the menu.  After only a week open, there was already a fair sized lunch crowd, so I'd recommend checking this place out soon before word gets out.

Prices were a little expensive for some in our group, but all of that discussion ceased when the HUGE portion sizes came out.  Everybody has enough left over for dinner.

I'll be back!
