Disclaimer: this is a strictly atmosphere/bar/drink-related review. This has nothing to do with food....yet.

Charming wood tables, lots of exposed brick and an eclectic mix of people: students, professors young and old. A bustling but not too noisy atmosphere, this place seems perfect for anyone looking for a few low-key drinks. There were tables for couples tucked away in the corner, big tables for groups and plenty of spaces at the bar. Great beer selection and a short walk from my new pad, I will definitely be back here. Maybe soon I will talk about the food.

OH - one odd thing...I THINK the restrooms are co-ed? The signs on the doors say "either or" with pictures that made no indication as to whether they meant "male" or "female."
