Lakaton!  Warm service.  A bit cramped in the dining room, but wonderfully delicious pasta dishes that always feel interesting yet familiar.  The lamb ragu here should probably go up on my Top 10 list of comfort foods.  The Manager/Host is consistently warm and inviting.  It's like he's welcoming you to his home.  I like that.  It's a CASH ONLY place and you should probably know that before coming here.  It's worth the effort though, you won't be disappointed!
