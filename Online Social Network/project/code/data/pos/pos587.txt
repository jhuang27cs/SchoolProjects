Taza 21 is hands-down the best Middle Eastern food in Squirrel Hill. I usually get the falafel wrap, but I've also tried the chicken shawarma, baba ghanoush, and hummus. The falafel is on the smaller side but a great lunch treat. The sides are similarly awesome, not too lemony as with some of the other Pittsburgh Middle East I've tried. The food can take a while to prepare but come bearing chill vibes and you'll be good. Great spot for a sunday morning hangover recovery. There's a good sense the owner will take care of you, he's very respectful and my visits are always a pleasure.
