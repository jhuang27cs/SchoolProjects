Maybe my last 6 years in SF have tainted me but What a huge let down...

The food was really heavy, a lot of flavor but in some dish and not enough in others. My hanger steak was pretty good but there was way to much peppercorn, seriously I started coughing on a few bites. My wifes fish on the other hand had no taste, Or friends got the duck which was ok and the chicken which was good but no better then a 10 dollar whole chicken from russo's or whole foods. These are $30-38 entrees they really need to step it up. The Service was good but for $60+ per person the food fell way short. I am not sure what all the hype is a bout but I would skip this joint for sure.

SECOND VISIT
I need to add to my post and have added 2 stars, after my 1st  review I was contacted by the owner, they comped us another meal and this time it was much better. I had chicken 3 ways and wife had the fish special both were very good. Our drinks apps and dessert were also very good. 

On another note local business should pay much closer attention to their reviews. Cragie definitely cares about this and value their customers experience.
