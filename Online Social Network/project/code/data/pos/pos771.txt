Great salon!  I love Yalaney and miss her terribly as my hair stylist now that I have moved away from LA.  She would highlight and cut my hair and always did a perfect job, and I am uber picky when it comes to my hair.  I tried the other places in Westwood and was less than impressed until I tried Henri's.  Great salon, great location, and thursday nights after 5ish they serve margaritas! How can you go wrong with that?!?!
