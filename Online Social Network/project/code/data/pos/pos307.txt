As a woman who works on her feet full time I regretfully say that I have never had a pedicure.  Until today that is.  What was I thinking?  I could not be happier with my experience at Queen Nail.  It was so so so clean which was very important for me.  I went late afternoon on a Monday and was the only person in there (which i enjoyed) But i suspect they'd be busier at a more high traffic time.  My pedicure was wonderful and the massage chair didn't hurt either! There is a quiet tv playing and a vast selection of trashy magazines (double thumbs up).  Worth every penny, and it wasn't that many seeing as the pedi was only 25!  You can pay on your debit/credit card but don't forget cash to tip these awesome ladies.
