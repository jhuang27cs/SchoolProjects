I went into Harlem Flo today and it smelled so good! They have gorgeous orchids and lush house plants. They sell scented candles in floral scents and beautiful arrays of fresh cut flowers are in the back. They also landscape terraces and patios and provide arrangements for special events and weddings.

I was informed by the friendly shopkeeper that they change their decor every two weeks so I'll be back the beginning of April to see what spring things Harlem Flo has to offer!
