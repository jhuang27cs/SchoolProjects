The first time I visited American Apparel, it was the location in Center City at 16th and Walnut near its competitor, Urban Outfitters.  My gut impression was, "Wow, what weird stuff...who wears this anymore?"  However, if you dig deep enough, you can find some wearable pieces--for me, basic solid colored t-shirts that feel like you're walking around in your favorite broken-in bedsheets are a must.  I haven't bought anything from American Apparel yet, but the University City location seemed to be a bit more spacious and have a bigger selection.  And they sell Sharpies in every color of the rainbow...out of place yet you never know when you might need to buy one...or two...or three.
