Every couple of months, the La Jolla Rock Bottom hosts a special "Brewmaster Dinner" in their upstairs bar.  The head chef and brewmaster get together and create a unique menu centered on seasonal foods paired with whichever specialty beers are currently tapped.  The cost is around $35 + tax/tip, reservations required, and always seems to sell-out.

In terms of mouthgasms, the food/beer combos at these events could go head to head with The Rabbit.  Last Saturday, the theme was Beer and Bacon; here's the menu (with pairings and my comments**):

Beer of your choice to start
**Full pour of any beer in the place
~~~~~~~~
Prosciutto-wrapped Melon & Figs - Tender Italian prosciutto around fresh melon and Figs with a bit of tangy goat cheese.
Paired with Liquid Sun Belgian-Style White Beer
**I'm not big on figs, but stuff 'em with goat cheese, add a little prosciutto and throw a beer into the mix and that's one less bowl of Total needed for the ol' daily fiber allowance.
~~~~~~~~
Shrimp Diablo - Large shrimp stuffed with a jalapeno sliver and fresh cilantro, wrapped in bacon & topped with a spicy bbq sauce.
Paired with Hop Bomb IPA 
**I don't have anything to say about this course other than it was f'n delicious.
~~~~~~~~
Pork Tenderloin with Cocoa Spice Rub 
Crusted with Cacao Nibs, chili powder, coriander and brown sugar.  Served with sweet potato mash.
Paired with Samurai Imperial Stout
**The pork was so tender that you could've cut it with a spork; a knife was definitely overkill.  It was so amazing, in fact, that my pants may have puffed up a little during this course.

Butter Cream Gelato over shortbread with Maple Bacon
Freshly made gelato from Gelato Vero over house-made shortbread with Maple Bacon
Paired with Naughty Scot Scottish-style Ale with Rum Soaked Oak chips.
**Um, hello Maple-soaked bacon, where have you been all my life?  It was like breakfast knocked up dessert and they spawned a shortbread love child.  Bow-chica-bow-wow.

The next dinner will be for Valentines Day and will be a beer and chocolate-themed pairing.  If it's half as good as the one last year, there won't be a dry seat in the house.
