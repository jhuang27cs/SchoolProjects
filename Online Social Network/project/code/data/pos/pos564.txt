So close to home and so comforting (only a block away). Green St restaurant is a pretty solid place in my book. Fun Friday & Saturday night environment with delicious seasonal menus. Their cocktails is also amazing! My favorite and go to drink is the Bohemian - while girly to the eyes, it has a nice manly kick for all types of sex ;) My man friend was hesitant to get one since it was so "girly looking" but he was not disappointed after a sip. 

My bf and I always end up taking our out of towner friends here because well, we think this is a solid place for food and drinks!
