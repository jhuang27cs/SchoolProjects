This is my favorite place of all time. I've driven from LA to SLO just to eat here. The barbecue sauce is AMAZING! Everything here is AMAZING! I can never decide what to get when I go here. Here's what I rotate between; tri tip sandwich, chicken wings and the ABC burger. Their fries are delicious also! Wings are fried and spicy. ABC burger is ten times more delicious then In N Out. I don't even know what to say about the trip tip sandwich. Words can not describe it. If you are a meat eater, you'll love it. It's bread, bbq sauce and like 2 inches of steak. Just amazing! My mouth is watering trying to describe the food.
