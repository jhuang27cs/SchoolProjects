Plum Blossom is a notch above all of the other local Chinese Restaurants I've tried around here. The restaurant is interior is something to be seen in person. The woodwork is fantastic. It's also by far the cleanest looking Chinese Restaurant I've been into around here. I'm guessing because unlike a lot of the others, it's not a take out based business. They seem to usually have a fairly busy dining room, and on the weekends it's usually packed. Which is probably part of the reason they have such a nice atmosphere.

I've gotten takeout from here a few times and it's usually very quick and the food packed at a hot enough temperature to stay very warm until I get it home and serve it. 

The people who take the phone orders are very nice and always get my requests right. No bean sprouts in my lo mein? Not a problem. No broccoli in the sesame chicken? That's not a problem either.

The food itself is very tasty. The sesame chicken isn't heavily battered and greasy. It's got a nice crispy, but light texture to it and the chicken is of good quality. I like it. I usually get the chicken lo mein for myself. Not only is it yummy, but I can eat it out of the carton and all I need is a fork. No extra dishes is always a good thing.  

Couple of complaints. One being, the credit card machine has been down twice when I've gone to pickup a to go order. Once they told me this beforehand and the other time, I had to leave, go to the ATM and come back. Not so convenient. Second, they could use a website. I'd like to see the menu before I call in an order. Might inspire me to try some different things.
