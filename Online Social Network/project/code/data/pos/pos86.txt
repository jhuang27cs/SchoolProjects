Can't believe I never went to this place when I lived in the area for several years.  Had dinner here last night.  They have fantastic BBQ.  I especially liked their cheesy grits, pepper corn bread and jalapeno hushpuppies.  Crooks has a very down home feel and nice outdoor seating..located in decent location on W Franklin St.
