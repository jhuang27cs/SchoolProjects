I flew down for one mission and it was to distract one of my girl friends because her boyfriend was planning to propose to her at Hip Kitty last Friday night (September 12th). MISSION MARRY ANNE ACCOMPLISHED! Everything went according to plan! 

It was my first time there and heard so many good things about this place so I had to see it for myself. 

How could you not get turned on by the live jazz band and fondue noshing? I mean, c'mon..a full bar, ample leather couches and seating, great vibe, diversed crowd and even ample garage parking right across the street! 

Okay..about the food. Anne ordered the cheese fondue and it was so good. We dipped pieces of bread, vegetables and fruit in it. It had a bit of heat which I liked. She also ordered a bottle of Reisling. 

The only thing I will complain about is the bar service. Bartenders are so slow! Holy cow. We were standing by the bar trying to flag someone and finally, service. If that was up in SF, bar managers would totally step it up. I don't understand why it takes 10 minutes to make 2 drinks?! Time is of the essence. 

Service was spotty. Although, our server did not know what is on the wine menu nor had any inkling to what kind of wine is a reisling, a difference between a pinot gris or a pinot noir. I was a bit taken aback by his miseducation but then again, I may have high standards since I am from Northern California. /endsarcasm.

We didn't have time to get the full meal deal, definitely next time is a MUST. I'll be back!
