This is a traditional Persian restaurant with delicious traditional food. It has all the basics and a great restaurant for the daring person whom wishes to expand their horizons. I am an Iranian and truly enjoyed the food which we had. 

Apps: salad shirazi= diced salad (below average)
Bademjoon=eggplant(amazing)
Tadeek and ghormesabzi=crunchy rice and herb/bean stew(good)

Main course: I had the Soltani (amazing). This is a steak skewer(barg) with a ground beef skewer(kubideh). The barg was smokey and tender while the kubideh was moist and juicy. 

The wife had the joogeh kabob (chicken kabob) which also was excellent. 

The nuance was great with sliding doors and Berkeley right outside. 

The only gripe I have are the bugs right outside. Some of these get into the restaurant. Store owner needs to buy a Blower which attaches to the top of the door and blows air every time you open the door in order to prevent  the bugs from coming in.

Highly recommended
