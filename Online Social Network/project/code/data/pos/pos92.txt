The Bridge is a pretty interesting Theater. My friends actually got married in one of the Movie rooms, had a reception in the bar area, which later extended into the Rotunda. The seats there are really nice and the place is clean. Its a good place to see the latest Blockbuster. I applied to work there when it first opened up, but they wouldn't hire me because of my tattoo.
