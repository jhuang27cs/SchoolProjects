It's not just a drug store!!  Although it is that, too.  The pharmacist has  been there since I was an undergrad last decade.

Hint: Let your olfactory senses lead you to the rear, and order a tasty burger.  The chicken fingers are decent, fries are on par, but the milkshakes are over the top!  Yum.  Decent hot dogs, too. 

Steer clear if you're calorie counting or are socially awkward and "can't handle" sitting next to someone you might not know.

PS Don't bring a group, its infrastructure isn't set up for that.
