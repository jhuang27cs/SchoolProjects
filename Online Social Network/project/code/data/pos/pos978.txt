Shopped about $27 worth of things today. Considering this is Daiso, where a lot of things are generally $1.50 and up, that means I needed a large bag for my numerous items. This place has a bunch of neat, cheap things that are obviously not great in terms of quality but, if you're resourceful, can nab some necessities for much less than normal. For instance, I needed baskets and containers for my desk in order to organize my upcoming semester's papers, exams, and school supplies. I managed to nab some nifty things for very cheap. And I'm not planning on throwing my plastic bins around the room in order to "test its quality" so I figured it would be a fine investment. 

Look around the store; you'll see the Asian-ness screaming at your face. Good and cheap Asian-ness. I wouldn't suggest buying everything from here - like makeup, or maybe even the pencils? - because again, emphasis on "not-too-great quality", but be a smart shopper, as well as somewhat adventurous. I got a small piggybank today among my cheap treasures, which I'm rather happy about.  I'm going to be returning very often!
