So Robert Wayne (or as my friends and I like to call it 'R-Dub' or as I will refer to it in this review 'RW') and I have some history together. I used to work here at this particular location, on and off for around 3 years. At first I loved it. (This may be due my previous 3 year employment in the Plaza food court. Needless to say, this was a step up.) Then I grew to hate it. (Don't worry though folks. I will not waste your time and review this poorly run company and the greedy corporate bastards that sent me in search of greener pastures. I will write a real review. But just in case you were wondering, this place is in fact run by buffoons.)

ON WITH THE REVIEW!

In all honesty, when it comes to shoe stores, RW is really as good as it gets if you don't want to venture into Nordstrom. And honestly, I NEVER want to venture into Nordstrom. And what RW has really accomplished, is the Nordstrom shoe department, in a shop the size of the Nordstrom women's restroom. Granted they're down to about half the inventory of Nordstrom, but the good stuff, the shoes you really want and look for, are all there. So It's Nordstrom minus all the crap. And minus all the FOB crap that Journey's carries. Not only is Journey's selection weak, but they only offer the kind of  colors that only the certain type of gentlemen who wear ill fitting saggy jeans, edge their hair and wear do rags, stroll in hoping  to find to match the brand new New Era cap they just purchased at LIDS. 

Don't tell me I'm wrong, because I'm not.

And when they do have a decent color/style they almost never have your size. 

I happen to avoid shoe stores like Journey's and Sheik because I feel like the employees might actually mug me. There be some scary bitches up in there. And the Vans store employees? It's like their balls haven't dropped/ they haven't gotten their periods. I do not like asking a child if they believe I should go with the half size smaller because the canvas is going to stretch out enough over time. I'm sorry sweetie but a nod is not a real answer. At RW the customer service is still there. If there's one thing RW is known for, it's the ridiculous amount of customer service. During my initial training, my manager said they try to keep their customer service up to Nordsrtom standards. RW employees are schooled in footwear knowledge. I had to learn different type of toe styles, tread, and stitching as well as different types of leathers, cleaners, and how to properly fit a shoe. 

Unfortunately I have been back to this location and been disappointed with the customer service a few times. This made me a little sad because I remember the pride a lot of us took in knowing what we offered customers. (I GUESS we did have our moments where we left a not so kind impression on customers, but they deserved every bit of it, and we enjoyed every bit of it.)  I thought perhaps the company was loosing its old school emphasis on it's customer service. Luckily as of now, the current store manager is Adam. He is a delight and when dealing with his employees you can see his direct influence on them. Hopefully Robert Wayne continues to stay on track.

Helpful Hints: 
-They don't give refunds! Store credit and exchange only. I know it sounds primitive, but their reasoning is that they most likely have something in store that will be to your liking, and if not you can special order from the vendor of your choice directly through them. 
- The employees work partially off commission, so be nice when they try to up sell. Its just part of their job. And all of the products really do work. That being said, sometimes we did lie about the fit/ availability to make a sale since there are not refunds. So go in with some common sense
- Don't come here looking for out of this world deals. It's still the mall. But management does walk the malls on a regular basis and adjusts prices to keep up with competition. They also price match any competitor in the mall as long as the size and color are in stock. 
-They offer layaway which is nice. So you can purchase your UGGS in the summer and not rush to make what seems like a silly purchase considering the season, but isn't since that's when they really start loading up on winter inventory ;-)
-They carry mens, women's, children, and baby sizes.
-They are the absolute best place for Dr. Martens. THEE BEST. Hands down, from the in store selection to the special order process, RW is your best bet.

I'm going to go ahead and say that Robert Wayne Footwear is a solid choice for your footwear needs. Unless you want to be mugged while looking at rasta colored Nike Dunks at Journey's...
