They're open late with a great choice of munchies. Sure it's just fries, but don't you sometimes want JUST FRIES? Cuz I do. Maybe it's a girl craving thing... Try the Jamacian Jerk seasoning and Mango Chutney dipping sauce. Mmm, amazing, especially after hours of gallavanting at the bars.

p.s. i LOVE how they're super clean. even the deep fryers are still shiny and not gross-looking like at some other places..

New edit:
I realized, that this place is the reason why I started to REALLY like beer as a beverage to accompany food, and not just alcohol to get totally smashed off of. (Though it serves the latter purpose very well haha.) Thanks, Bel Frites, now I'm obsessed with Stella Artois!!! But not as obsessed as I am with these beautiful fries. Ohhh man.
