They fixed the music! Now you can savor your specialty latte to some awesome shifting soundscapes.

Something I forgot to mention in my previous review: I love that they offer little snacklets -- animal crackers and chocolate-covered pretzels -- by the scoop.  Maybe they should shelve the baked goods altogether (they semi-hide them behind the counter, anyway) and expand their array of cookie jars?  I'd gladly pay a buck or two to have a couple oreos or speculoos with my coffee.
