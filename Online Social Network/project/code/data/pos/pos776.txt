Truluck's string fries are my favorite kind of fries (yes, over truffle fries and duck fat fries and sweet potato fries and whatever else kind of fries you throw at me). But my friend told me they changed it??? I need to go back and make sure it's not true!

I love their happy hour menu (crabcake sliders!)

The drinks are fabulous as well. Last time, the waitress suggested Red Door for my friend and we ordered a whole round of those after our mojitos. Delish!
