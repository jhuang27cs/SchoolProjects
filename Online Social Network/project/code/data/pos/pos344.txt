I love this place! It is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I probably average a couple of visits per week. 

EVERYTHING here is good. I don't think I've had anything that I don't like. They have a great carnitas plate and the tacos are awesome. 

They have STRONG margaritas. Seriously strong. If you're feeling especially courageous, go for the cadillac margarita. If you drink more than one, you probably won't remember much of dinner. So, in other words, thumbs up on the margaritas. 

Parking can be a little bit annoying when it's busy, but I usually park across the street in the evening (when the other businesses are closed) and have never had an issue with this.
