I loved the place!  My friend and I had bacon pad thai .... and it was AMAZING.  We also shared a curry dish and had a little sushi to boot.  I'd go back in a heart beat.  I wish there was a way to upload the photographs I took with my phone - the food was  not only delicious, it looked really good too.
