This is the University of North Carolina's one-stop shop for everything you might need whether you're  a student or a fan on campus for a game. 

Student Stores has by far the best collection of Carolina apparel with Nike, New Era, and Under Armor. As far as collectables go, Johnny T-Shirt (on nearby Franklin Street)  has Student Stores beat by a bit, but not by much. The big difference between Student Stores and the Carolina Shops on Franklin Street is that, where you might find a similar set of products in the Franklin Street shops, Student Stores gives some overlap, but is mostly products you won't find on Franklin Street. 

The Store also features a mini-mart, the Daily Grind coffee shop, Bull's Head Book Shop, a US Post Office, an entire floor of textbooks, and a tech shop downstairs. Student Stores is newly remodeled and they really did a great job. 

For textbooks Student Stores tends to be the most expensive and the mini-mart has a slight mark-up. Other than that this is really a super store.
