Way to go messing up the orders!!! There's like 5 consecutive orders that were punched in wrong... I asked for a pastrami rueben over stuffed the guy punched in a Rachel turkey overstuffed! Well you got 2 things right the potato salad and the overstuffed part!!!

My hot sandwich was good but i could use more meat though!
