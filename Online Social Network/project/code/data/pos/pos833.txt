You can't hate on this place. Mostly, if you love a burger, you're going to like this place guaranteed. But then again, a good cheeseburger warms my heart just as much as a perfectly timed mojito.

I had the Dallas Burger and honestly it's been a long time since I've ordered a burger "medium rare" and truly got it medium rare. That makes me smile right off the bat.

The jalapeno sauce they have has even made me want to go home and replicate. That's the when a restaurant goes from a 3 to a 4 star-- if it makes me want to go home and duplicate. Afterall, imitation is the highest form of flattery.

I could do without the ostentatious 45 minute line (and that was during a line that was just barely out the door). They have two cash registers. Use 'em, people.
