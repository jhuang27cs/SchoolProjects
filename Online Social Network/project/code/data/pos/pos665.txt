Friendly staff, neighborhood atmosphere, and tasty food.  The Szechuan dishes are very spicy, but really delicious -- dun dun noodles, Suan Chow Show dumplings with bean spouts both excellent.  We also liked the Mongolian beef (arrived on a sizzling platter),  egg rolls (crisp and not at all greasy), and scallion pancakes.
