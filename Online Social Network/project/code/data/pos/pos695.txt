I thoroughly enjoy the hike down to Black's Beach and the beautiful views along the way. However, it is steep and not recommended for all, or even most. I don't know of an easier way to Black's because I always choose to run down and back up for exercise. If you're in decent shape, it's a fun trek.

The views once you reach the beach are different, and not usually beautiful. It seems the nude beach-goers are usually the elderly or those who are nude solely for their own benefit. Don't expect to see naked Baywatch babes running with their unsupported breasts bouncing together, BUT you may find some entertainment in the naked volleyball games with all sorts of stuff bouncing and jiggling... 

This beach is definitely less crowded than other beaches nearby, and people, as you may imagine, are very carefree. Always a good time at Black's...
