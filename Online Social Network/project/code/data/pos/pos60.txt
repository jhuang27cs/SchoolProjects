I have been going to Atlanta Yoga for almost a year now regularly.  I take Anusara yoga classes there from Gina.   I love it!  Gina is a great teacher, enthusiastic and very willing to work with you on any issues you might have.  Anusara is different from Ashtanga, more alignment based and you get into the poses for longer.  Generally, the Anusara classes are appropriate for all levels, so do not be afraid to give it a go.  The studio space itself is nice with hardwood floors and a loft-like interior.
