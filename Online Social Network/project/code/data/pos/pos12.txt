One of the best nights of my life. Hands down.

It was just amazing... The amount of people that gathered all for the same thing, The music pumping through your body everywhere you walked, The day turned to night, and the fireworks that illuminated the sky as you danced without a care to the blissful beats of Deadmau5 and others. It was a night that I will never forget.

Yes, it was not perfect, but what event of that size ever has been. I mean you don't show up to the largest rave in america and not expect there to be a shit load of people there. The numbers have been increasing every year, so why would this one be any different? If not, it would only be even bigger, since the biggest rising dance artist of the year, and the biggest name in trance are headlining...

And as for all that crap about fence jumping and people getting hurt, and that one girl even died!.. OK, my condolences go out to that girls family, having a death in the family is hard, i cant even imagine it being your child.... BUT you cannot blame her taking drugs on an event, any more than video-games for kids shooting other kids. Its their own ignorance and apathy. As for all those people who got hurt. More than likely their own fault. Some 250 out of 180,000 people messed up, and now theres this huge dim view on raves. Cause there have been less riots and fights due to hockey, or football, or basketball, etc. right? (note: sarcasm above)

My final word/opinion: Definitely the best massive I've ever been to. Just as good, if not better than last year! Can't wait for next year!
