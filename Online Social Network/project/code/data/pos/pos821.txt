Pure deep dish delight

(First, I must make an odd observation about Del's.  I've NEVER, EVER, EVER been to a pizza shoppe that DIDN'T have 'suggested' pizzas on their menu!  No "Hawaiian", "Supreme", or "Carnivore Lovers" pizzas here... if you don't bring your own inspiration, then you're SOL at Del's!  The waiter gave me a funny look when I mentioned this, as if he'd never noticed this before.  Strange...

But back to the food...  This place makes pretty solid deep-dish pizza.  As with most deep-dish, it takes a while for it to come out, so plan your dinner time accordingly.  We ordered a large pizza, and each slice was practically a meal in itself.  It also reheated nicely the next day, which was a nice bonus.  The pizza WAS moderately expensive, but worth it.

Note:  I wasn't as impressed with their cheese-bread appetizer as I was with their pizza.  I wouldn't recommend it.

One other POSITIVE noteworthy addition:  I needed to break a $20 to get change for the parking meter.  The server didn't have the exact change on him, so he just smiled, gave me 4 quarters, and said "Don't worry about it."  I don't see this kind of generosity very much.  It's only a buck, but it made my day.  Needless to say, he received a handsome tip from me!)
