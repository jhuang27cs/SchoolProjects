I love Daisy Mint, the sister restaurant to Abricott, and when my husband found out that they were opening a new restaurant, I knew it was going to be equally exceptional!  Abricott is fresh modern quaint and expressive in food and decor!  A wonderful place to eat great food and converse with friends and/or family.  The whole look of Abricott is extraordinarily vibrant and comfy at the same time.  The food leaves your taste buds wanting more.  The staff is alert in giving service like you were dining at a friends' house, comfort in a somewhat self serve atmosphere while acknowledging you are there.  I love their pho noodle soup, great to have on a cold day, earthy, savory and comforting.  The Sizzling eggs with toast is simple and savory, great in kick starting your day, especially with a cup of Lamill coffee!  Awesome Croque Monsieur and Croque Madame!  I also love their tender Savory pork belly with red cabbage, the combination is perfect.  Definitly going back for more!
