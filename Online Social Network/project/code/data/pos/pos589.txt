Really friendly staff, pretty quick turnarounds on repairs and maintenance, and a good selection of the odds and ends that you need to keep your bike running smoothly. 

I wish it were a bit larger of a store, just to complete their selection a bit more, but the bikes that they do offer are excellent and listed at pretty competitive prices.

I had been searching for a commuter bike online for the past few months, comparing online options and local shops. While most of the shops in the area have a similar selection of bikes, I thought BT was really helpful in helping me sort through the options and pick a reasonable city bike.  The price I paid for my Jamis Commuter was about $30 less than the other offers in the area.

Free air = bonus!
