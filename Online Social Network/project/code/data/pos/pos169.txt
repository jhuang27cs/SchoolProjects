Despite what others write, Dr. king did one hell of a surgury on my knee. Had a torn acl and its been 6 months and Im almost at 80% to fully recovering. And that's even after I ditched out of PT after 3 weeks. Dr king is nit there to butter things up for you. very blunt and direct about the diagnosis which is how'all Dr should be. This is my 3rd acl, but first with King. My prior acls took longer to just get me where I'm at after 6 Months
Thank you Dr King
