Great service! Waitresses were very friendly and we got a complimentary Miso soup. One of my favorite rolls is the Red Dragon Roll! It tastes great but besides that, all the rolls we ordered weren't very filling for the price we paid. I liked the hand rolls deal they're having (2 for 6): I recommend the spicy tuna one.
