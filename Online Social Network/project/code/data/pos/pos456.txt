Great variety, high prices, nice people. 

There are a lot of things packed into this store that are useful - glass jars for only $3, plain aprons, bar keeper's friend cleaner, unbleached cheesecloth, and endless varieties of colanders, knives, measuring implements and so on.  

It sounds like a mixed bag in terms of service.  I've only had great experiences with everyone being extremely friendly and willing to help me find items and, the great litmus test of service, process returns.

I'm torn on rating it four or five stars - I love the selection in the store - I was able to decide not to buy Le Creuset based on lifting the pots in the store (way too heavy!), but at the same time I couldn't find a great mug or teacup to buy.   I could get the unbleached cheesecloth I wanted but not the empty plastic jars.  The kitchen accessories that I do want are prices at high retail, so I feel vaguely uncomfortable buying them unless they are relatively rare or hard to find.  Sur La Table does have many items almost impossible to find elsewhere so for that alone I'll give five stars.  I love browsing and I've always felt welcome no matter how much or how little I spend, and it is a pleasant surprise to find many small and immensely practical items here at reasonable prices.  
This is probably the best place for a Stanford student foodie to go and stock their kitchen quickly, or grab that desperately needed whisk, steaming basket or what have you.
