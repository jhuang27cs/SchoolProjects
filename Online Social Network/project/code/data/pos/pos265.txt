Every time that I come home this is one of the places that I like to go.  They make really good burgers.  They are cooked on what tasts like an open bbq.  They use all fresh topings to make the burger taste yummy.

I also really like their fries.  There are not that many places that make good burgers and fries.  This place has it down.  Good fries and good burgers.  

If you are looking for a salad, they make a pretty amazing tri-tip salad.
