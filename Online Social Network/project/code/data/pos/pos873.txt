I LOVE THE WHITE PIZZA! I've been here multiple times and always had good food and good service. Went once on my birthday and staff was friendly and accommodating. I even bought the music CD they were playing over at (Cactus Mambo Ibiza). It's a good place to start off or end an evening in Rice Village or on a weekend afternoon. 

Next door to the Kelvin Arms is a plus and I highly recommend both places.
