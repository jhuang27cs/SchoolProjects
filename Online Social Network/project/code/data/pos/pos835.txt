What do you get when you stack slices of fatty beef in a french roll and then dip it into a dark brown sodium solution? You The Hat's representation of the pastrami.  I could lube my truck with this sandwich and still I keep coming back for more.  French dip roast beef sandwiches to double cheeseburgers and loads of fries and fried zucchini are what come to mind when I think of this place.

The first time I visited, I ordered a pastrami and chili cheese fries and a large Orange Bang.  What a mistake!  The order of chili cheese fries could feed a family of 5 and the sandwich was more than a meal.  Needless to say the drink alone had enough calories to power a small village, I elected not to do that again.

I suggest you visit Tommy's at least once in your life or you could simply stay home and eat a few sticks of butter... choice is yours.  I think Tommy's would taste better.
