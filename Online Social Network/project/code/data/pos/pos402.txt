Fun spot!  I've been to Harlem Tavern many times.  I agree that it's just what Harlem needed.  I've wasted away many a summer afternoons under a HT umbrella sipping cider or prosecco.

It's great for watching popular sporting events.  The crowd is fun and energetic.

Sometimes they have a live band, and they've always been really really good.  However, don't schedule a live band on the night of a Knick's game.  No matter how good the music is, people come to watch the game.  I'd definitely call before hand to check.

Nice beer list, including cider!  Mac and cheese is awesome!
