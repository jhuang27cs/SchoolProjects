My family of four enjoyed our dinner last night at Califia.

We started with chicken drummettes. All four including kids liked them.

We had barely got the drummettes when the main courses arrived. They could have waited five minutes..

I had the Japanese Beef curry. Very tasty. I asked the waitress for a wine recommendation and she recommended a great zinfandel. The only minus was that the wine serving was rather small.

Hubby had the fiery bottom pork rice bowl. He loved it but I found it a bit too spicy.

Kids had the pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. They enjoyed both.

The desserts were really good. Kids both had the ice cream cookie sandwiches with chocolate sauce. Ice cream is from Rick's ice cream in PA.

Hubby had ginger creme brulee with lemon cookies. He really enjoyed that.

I asked for a single scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. That was really good.

The place is LOUD! We had to talk very loudly to hear each other.

Also, we had to wait 45 minutes for our table (we arrived at 6.45 pm on Saturday) but we walked down to Books Inc and shopped while we waited.

We will return!
