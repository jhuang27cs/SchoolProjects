If you dare, venture off the chili side of the menu and try out their "Grilled Chicken Club."  It's one of the best sandwiches of any kind I've ever had anywhere!  I've gotten several Chili Parlor regulars to try it for the first time and they have all agreed that it's amazingly good.  The triple decker bread is always toasted just right, the grilled chicken breast is always tender and juicy, the bacon always crispy, the cheese tasty, and the lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise fresh and delicious!  This sandwich basically is a work of art.  And the TCP cooks are very consistent in the way they make it, so you never have to worry about getting a bad one.  Try it.  You'll LOVE it.
