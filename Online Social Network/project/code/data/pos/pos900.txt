I wouldn't think I'd like a sports bar, but I really like Chumley's. The beer selection is huge.
The vibe is pretty friendly, and it's been a good place to catch up with people when in town. 
If I still smoked, it would get five stars, but because I don't the air gets a little thick and unbearable after awhile. So, four stars.
