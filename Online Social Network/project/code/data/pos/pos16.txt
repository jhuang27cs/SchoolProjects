We had lunch here today and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. We chose one of the outdoor patios and was immediately greeted by our waitress, Lindsey. My wife ordered the Pub & Cheese and I ordered the Ortega chicken sandwich.

 During the short wait for our food, I started to have buyers remorse.  The fish & chips that were delivered to the table next to us looked awesome.... Oh wait... look at the prime rib sandwich... Damn, I should have ordered that.

 I shouldn't have worried... My wife's Mac & cheese was out of this world, as was my sandwich. The garlic fries that come with the sandwich were plentiful and cooked to perfection. To top it off, Lindsey had just made salsa and brought some to us with chips, gratis. Wow!

Service and food were A+. The Kilt is going to be a regular place for us to eat in SLO.
