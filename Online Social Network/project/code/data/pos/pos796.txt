This isn't my favorite bbq in the city (that would be Hill Country, though Dinosaur & Rub come close).  But this is a great meal option for when you're uptown & want some comfort food.  The chicken wings & bbq ribs are delicious, the mac & cheese scrumptious as well & you MUST try the strawberry lemonade... I (& my husband) could drink it by the vat!!  The down-home ambiance is part of the whole experience & the service was accommodating.  Portions aren't ginormous but a little goes a long way, ha.  Admittedly, the 1st time I got food here (salmon croquettes to go... it must've been a special because I don't see them on the menu), I thought it was "meh" & overpriced... I'm so glad that the hubby & I gave this place another chance.  So while this isn't an "omg-amazing" place, it DOES make for a really satisfying meal!
