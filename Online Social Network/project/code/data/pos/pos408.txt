We are always looking for a new place in the Chambana area during football season and somehow Black Dog had eluded us.  Luckily I ran into a friend who opened our eyes.  

We went to the ASU night game and after a long night of cheering we were hungry!  We arrived around 9:30 / 10:00 pm and the place was still pretty full.  When we sat down the server announced that they were out of quite a few menu items.  We weren't shy about our disappointment and a little bit later the server told us they were going to make more of the twice baked potato casserole.  Hooray!  Oh and they were DELICIOUS!

Everything was so good.  The bbq has more of a smoked flavor which I really like.  I ordered the pulled pork with the house sauce.  The sauce was a bit spicy (I am a wimp) but I did sample some others that I liked.  

I can't wait to go back to try some burnt ends and some other sauces.
