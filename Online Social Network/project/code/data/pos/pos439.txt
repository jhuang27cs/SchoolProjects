I'm biased by the fact that USC football games happen here (the only reasons I have ever been there is football games) and when the fans all get together in the stands, it's a fun place to be.  Honestly the stadium is not in that great of shape (kind of old), but because it's the home of the Trojans, I really don't care.  I imagine renovations might happen in the future, but I really don't have any solid grounds to base that idea on
