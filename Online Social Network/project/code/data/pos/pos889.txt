Just got my hair cut here. I haven't had my hair cut professionally in seven years; most of this time my hair was short and I had figured out how to cut it myself with some interesting first experiences.

Anyway, now that my hair had actually grown out beyond my scope of expertise, I came here at the suggestion of my fiance. They can do it. They can cut my hair and his and have us in and out in about a half hour. It looks good, too! And affordable!

I didn't get anything fancy, mostly cleaned up my tangled mass, but my head feels so much lighter and has a simple, nice shape. I could have gotten fancier with it, but I'm low-maintenance and at the suggestion of the haircutter went with simple. Glad I did, too.

They are extremely friendly. Very personable. Yes, I will be going back here!
