Caliban Book Shop has to be the most remarkable bookstore in the 'Burgh.  It isn't quite a used bookstore.  You don't go here expecting to find used paperbacks of Steinbeck or Dickens.  No, this is really much more of an antique and collector's bookstore.  As a reviewer on another site says, the first thing you notice upon entering the place is the sweet scent of old books.  I found an old book on pop music once as a gift for my dad.  He really loved it.

They do get used textbooks and not-so-rare paperbacks too.  So if you want to escape the look-alike world of the major chains (Barnes & Noble or Borders, not that there's anything wrong with those places) then by all means, drop in here!
