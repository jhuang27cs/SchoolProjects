The owner of this delicious chocolate shop has learned from the absolute best chocolate makers in the world--and he's incredibly passionate about chocolate.  Chat with him and he'll give you the history of chocolate and why his is so vastly different (and I must say, eons better) than many other chocolatiers.  His chocolate has more than 70% cocoa (most of American chocolate is about 6%), making it rich, creamy, and healthy with many antioxidants.  It's well worth the $$ spent.  Their truffles are truly amazing, you can't go wrong with your choice.
