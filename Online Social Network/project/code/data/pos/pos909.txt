Fresh fish, creative rolls, although I must say some of the rolls are over the top. 

I started with some tuna tartare and ebi soro. The tuna tartare was different compared to other places, it had a little tangy kick to it. The ebi soro was button mushroom with a shrimp stuffing. I prefer the fresh taste of the tuna tartare.

For rolls I ordered the shichi hako and the lotus, both were excellent. The shichi hako was a box type roll with a little bit of everything. The lotus was a shrimp tempura roll topped with snow crab, it's actually real snow crab, not imitation.

All the nigiri was very fresh, the uni especially. The o toro is one of the best in the area I have ever tasted. Not only was it good, it was way underpriced, $13 at the time, the price changes with the market.

I had the lychee sherbet for dessert, tasty, palate-cleansing, and fresh.

The atmosphere is very nice, chic, up-scale, and modern. The service was very friendly, knowledgeable wait-staff (mine was at least).

Well, rounded sushi place, with price that is very affordable. The perfect choice for a first date restaurant.
