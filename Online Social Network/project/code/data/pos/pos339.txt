Curse NJ highways. 

Curse NJ highways with copious stoplights and no left or u-turns, with horribly dangerous situations where people are turning right at 15 mph and people in the middle and left lane are going 50. You are the reason I missed the entrance to Whole Foods and decided it wasn't worth the 20 minutes it would take to loop back around.

But I guess thanks to the horrible situation mentioned above, I turned off at the next exit and happened upon Wegmans, a worthy alternative. I discovered about 5 new types of apples (you mean there's more than fuji and gala?). 

Tons of fresh produce and healthy foods at a reasonable price. The only problem I saw was tons of empty produce bins. I guess they switch things out around 9 pm - bad for me but good for everyone else who doesn't shop at weird hours. 

Definitely will be back, though hopefully to a more convenient location that is not off the dreaded 1.
