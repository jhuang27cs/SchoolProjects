Consistently fresh and flavorful, Koja is one of my go-to lunch joints. I'm fairly inexperienced with both Korean and Japanese, but Koja's dishes seem reasonably authentic. I'm a huge fan of the flat rice noodles and the udon noodles. After they're boiled, the noodles are thrown on the flat top grill where they pick up the most wonderful char. And there's just enough oil to cook and flavor the noodles. The shredded cabbage and sesame seeds provide additional texture and flavor. I ask for "medium spicy" which has a substantial kick without being painful. Sometimes, when it's freezing out, the owner gives you free hot tea while you wait! The noodle portions are very generous.
