I cannot recommend this salon highly enough. It is the only place I will go in Providence at this point. I've come to Ky countless times after having done something stupid to my hair and he always fixes me up to T, and the compliments just come streaming in thereafter! 
After finding Ky Michael's Salon, for the first time I look forward to getting my hair cut.
