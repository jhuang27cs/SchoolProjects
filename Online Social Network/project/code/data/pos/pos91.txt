I LOVE THE LONE WOLF. A LOT. 
we drive here from boston all the time. it is my favorite place to get (vegan) breakfast in the entire state. 

i get: tofu scramble, a gigantic side blueberry pancake, soy sausage, iced coffee. it is so much food i almost puke, but it in a good way. 

and yes. you can get a SIDE pancake. and it is huge. and good. 
and if there is a wait for a table it is possible you can sit at the bar and eat. or: walk to rao's or go to the bakery next door for coffee or something.
