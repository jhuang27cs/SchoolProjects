Fresh Comfort Food Kicked up a Notch!

WOWZA PALOOZA~ this place is simply perfect. My boyfriend found it my accident looking for this other Hot Dog place for dinner.

After a LONG day of shopping I really needed something to refuel me. This place knows how to SET A MOOD.

Immediately when you walk in, you notice how Clean and Cool it is, it's new age classic.

The menu is written on big chalk boards, and the first thing I noticed were the Bleu Cheese Sweet Potoato Fries. OMG are you kidding me? Sounded amazing!

I knew I was gonna get the fries so on to the DOG. I Like the options that they have for toppings, and I really like the Build Your Own option..

BUT..

No need for me, once I read the Master Creations that they had available already, My mouth immediately started to water. I decided to try the GRAND SLAM and WHOA was it ever!

Grand Slam= 
*Huge Dog (i think they might be Hebrew National-they tasted amazing) 
*Bacon (this bacon is THICK CUT and cooked to PERFECTION)
*Tots (TaterToTs on a hot dog, OMG)
*Fried Egg (Fried perfectly I might add, the white part was cooked fully and the yolk was gooey and oozy but not RUNNY-aaaamazing)
*Hawaiian Sweet Roll (Don't be mistaken, it was three rolls combined to create the perfect bun for this savory dog)

This combo was already glorious, but I decided to add avacado and take a trip to glory city. GOOD CHOICE ON MY PART

I ordered one of the Bottled Orange Cream Sodas (sounded good, but I'll probably get the root beer next time)

Design:
We walked to a table near the back and sat down, observing the cool and sleek cozy city style of the place. 
I really liked how they chose mat paint for the walls-very modern.
The tables were really cool-huge dark wood slats on wheels with trendy stools to match. 
The lighting was perfect (finally a restaurant that GETS IT) I don't want lights blinding me while I'm trying to eat much less have a conversation.
Top it off with some tunes and I'm happy- good job Dog Haus.

Didn't take TOO long for our food to arrive...As soon as I got my dog I was excited to check out their extensive condiments bar---NICE TOUCH!

With a little mayo and some spicy mustard I'm good to Grub-don't wanna take away from the flavors.

THE DOG:
*The Bun was Soft and Sweet...YUM!
*The hot dog was Delicious and Juicy-no burning my tongue here!
*The Bacon was COOKED to PERFECTION-no chewy fatty pieces, perfectly crisped, thick cut bacon-OMFG
*Avacado-Very fresh and vibrant green-I'm happy guys.. really.
*The Egg was "over Medium" no white gooey parts-pure golden glaze--yumm
*The TOTS-perfect (but lets be honest, who can screw up tots)

Needless to say the dog was demolished-completely..SOo GOOOOD

But what about the Bleu Cheese Sweet Potato Fries?? Well guys don't get too excited cause I'll never order them again-i thought it was gonna be chunks of blue cheese, but it was a dressing and it was NOT good.

I'll get the fries again, but not the Blue Cheese Ones...

$$$=super reasonable-around 6 bucks for a delicious loaded dog.

They also have brats and burgers-I'm coming back for sure!

OVERALL I wish i could rate them a 4.5 but i can't--so they get a 5 due to the fact they the dogs are so CREATIVE and DELICIOUS-the quality of the food is spot on and the condiment bar is very unique and diverse. (Curry Ketchup, Gray Poupon, Spicy Mustard and much much more!)

I'll be going back SOON and I absolutely love this place...!!! You should definately go.
