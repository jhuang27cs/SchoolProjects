Overall: I like the food, prices, ambiance, speed of service, and friendly service.

The Good:
  - chili dog
  - french fries (they're worth the extra dollar)
  - hamburgers (while I've never had one, the place was packed with customers chowing down on burgers, so I'm assuming it must be good)

The Okay:
  - homemade chips (that come standard with meals; they're a little too hard)

The Bad:
  - PARKING
