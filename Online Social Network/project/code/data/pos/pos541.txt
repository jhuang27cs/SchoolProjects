I could easily rate this place 5 stars based on their tomato soup alone (which was by far the BEST I've ever tasted. Ever.).

The restaurant is airy and keeps with the loft style shops and apartments in the area. There's plenty of seating, and a open bar area that appeared to have a full bar offering.

The pizza itself is amazing - the options are limited, but flavors are limitless! And, you can always create something of your own making.
