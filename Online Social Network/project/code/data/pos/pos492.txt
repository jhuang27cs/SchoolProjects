Diddy riese is excellent on a hot day, cold day, windy day, rainy day, gloomy day, musky day...EVEN A SNOWY DAY in LA!

Yummy cookies, paired with some dryers ice cream.  Ohhh...scrum-dilly-icious!  The cookies are perfection.  Not soft, not crunchy or hard.  Not too sweet, not to salty.. A perfect harmony in your mouth of sweet savory goodness....

Seriously, you're still reading?  I can't believe I'm still typing.. I'd be up out of my seat, in my car or put my running shoes on to grab me a 1.50 ice cream sandwich... Don't forget your cash!
