Went here in search of a new road bike. Rich sent my boyfriend and I out on comparable bikes to the one I wanted. When we returned, Rich was looking at the specs trying to find the right fit for me. There was never any pressure during the purchase process and I ordered a bike with a down payment. I did have to call during the end of the 2-3 day window they provided me for when the bike would be ready and then I came in and was properly fitted. Again I felt Rich was very professional, precise and knowledgable when I asked him questions. Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend them and consider future purchases/adjustments, etc from them. Only downside is, it is downtown Princeton and therefore downtown Princeton prices-which I compared to a little above average.
