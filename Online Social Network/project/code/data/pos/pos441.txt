I'm all about great sandwich places, and The Cheese House definitely falls under that category.  Everything tastes fresh.  Great selection of cheese, as well as other fine deli items (chocolates, chips, crackers, etc.).

One drawback: there isn't much seating at all.  A few tables outside (none indoors) that are usually occupied by high schoolers.  But, the space is really small and there's not much they can do about that!  Not their fault so I'm not taking a star away.

Everything you'd want out of a sandwich place.  And probably a little bit more.

Also, I saw Andrew Luck here one day.  If he likes it, it's gotta be good! :)  GO CARD!
