After walking around in MIT we went to dinner at The Middle East Restaurant.  It's seems connected to ZuZu though I didn't ask about it.

There's a bar area that people were drinking at and one guy was eating some dolmas though looked good.

We got:
FREE pita - tasted store bought & brought in a bag -cold
bowl of lentil soup - tasty
baba ganoush - I liked it 
husband got a lamb shank - he said pretty good

Meal was like $20+, so a cheap meal for Cambridge, MA.

Recommended, though I can be Loud in there with loud music & high ceiling.
