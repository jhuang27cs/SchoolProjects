Seriously, guys? 1 star? 2 stars? Wow.

Just because all the other pho restaurants have horrible ambiances doesn't mean you can't applaud this restaurant for their ambiance!

Sure it's 1 dollar or 1.5 dollars more expensive than other places, but the quality is unparalleled. There is no MSG because the broth is made with time, care, and the proper amount of natural seasoning (which is expensive, mind you, and is the reason why the other places have to use so much MSG.)

Meticulous attention to detail regarding the food (pho noodles are precooked in extra strong broth and the tripe is marinated in extra strong broth for flavor, etc) and regarding the ambiance (the chicken coop wire on the cabinets behind the bar match the pattern on the fireplace cover).

The service is fantastic. Everyone here is really nice!

But to be honest, I come here for the food. It's my favorite pho and I've had a LOT of pho in my lifetime. No poorly cut meats, no MSG, organic ingredients, no post-pho dehydration, delicious noodles, delicious broth, etc... etc... I respect that!
