I think this place should be called "Jokers"...  they are always smiling!!!  This is warm, welcoming place to be.  Food, drinks are great, but the service with a smile makes this place different from any other places!!!  What are they eating?  Why are they so positive??  We need more businesses like this!  It's bit gray today... I think I might have to head down to Ugly Mug!!
