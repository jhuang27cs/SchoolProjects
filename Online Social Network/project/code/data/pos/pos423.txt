I was sitting on my bed, watching TV and enjoying my night when my brother rudely barged into my room and interrupted an intense HOUSE epsiode.  To my surprise he plopped down onto my bed a box of 4 mysterious food items that looked nothing like cupcakes from the top.  At first glance they looked like monstrous cookies with icing and unique toppings from above with the box closed.

Without wasting time we ripped open the box and started eating them.  My brother got 3 types: Vanilla with strawberry, Vanilla with chocolate + oreo crumbles on top, and Vanilla with chocolate + chocolate chips on top.

The cake was awesome and moist..good enough to eat on its own.  But then you add the light and not too nasty/heavy icing each with a particular and distinct flavor and you have a winning combination.

The first one devoured by both of us was the vanilla + choc frosting + oreo crumbs on top.  The oreos were finely grounded and sprinkled on top but added a slight crunch to the otherwise completely soft dessert.

I honestly don't really like cupcakes..I very much prefer yogurt over anything but hot damn, these are good.  Way better than that nasty ol (why is it still there damnit) hey cupcake place that used to set up shop near where I live.  These cupcakes are much bigger and definitely better!
