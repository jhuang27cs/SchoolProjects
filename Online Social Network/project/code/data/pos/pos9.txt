After enduring years of crappy, undercooked, bad pizza in and around Ann Arbor (a la pizza house, cottage inn, and the like), Silvio's brings real pizza to town. Real pizza should be thin, have a crispy, bubbly, sourdough crust and be full of flavor, not grease, and this is the only place to get it.

Don't be fooled by the "organic" part of the name, it really should be called "Silvio's Italian Pizza"

Beware though, the more toppings you get on this pizza, the less well it cooks all the way through, and the less of a full pizza experience you get. The Margherita is a little light on the cheese, my only complaint.
