Going in, I knew wagamama was an informal, chain restaurant so I've rated it as such.

All of our food was good - not the best asian noodles ever, but good, especially considering the wide selection.  

We had the edamame with garlic salt and chili, #36(?) coconut soup with chicken, #44 or 47 - the ginger chicken noodles, and ended with coconut ice cream and coffee for dessert.  Also tried the fresh squeezed juice and a glass of wine.  

Overall, the atmosphere (casual, super clean) and the selection will bring us back!
