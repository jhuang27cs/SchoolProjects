I was given a list of anywhere in L.A. to do traffic school, and despite the fact that Pasadena was clear across town from where I was up in L.A., I chose the Ice House. I choose it solely based on the positive Yelp reviews. I've been to an in person traffic school before, and I've also done it a couple times online, so I knew that it can be a horrendously boring experience, and I was not interested in sitting somewhere for 12 tedious hours with a boring instructor.

I'm so glad I chose to do traffic school here. I had Liza, and she was charismatic and made everybody laugh. It's called 'comedy traffic school', but that doesn't mean she's up there telling zingers and one liners. She is just great at getting everybody smiling and into a discussion about traffic, and she really does cover everything she's supposed to. The time flies by, the breaks are ample, and it's a great time. I don't know what bothered the one star reviewer so much, but I had no such issues.

If I have to do traffic school again, this is where I'll be, hands down.
