LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I'm always on the prowl for a delicious philly cheesesteak and after tasting the one at Hog Island I have no need to look any further! Perfect bread, perfect amount of cheese and the meat is tender and juicy...my mouth is starting to water just writing this.  My husband and I have a toddler and don't get "our time" a lot - this place made for a perfect lunch date!! We'll definitely be back!
