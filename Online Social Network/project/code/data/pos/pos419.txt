I have never cut my hair here but a brazillian wax only costs $25 + tip! Ask for Nazzy- she's sweet, fast, and experienced but a little rough at times. Usually brazillians take over half an hour but she was done in 10 minutes which sounds a little too quick, but either way she got the job done. They have waxing rooms in the back of the hair salon so it's comfortable and private. Only thing I thought was weird was that she used the same wooden waxing stick the entire time and kept dipping in the bowl of wax that was probably used for the person before and after me... pretty sure that is unsanitary but whatever. 

Oh and finding street parking is impossible but no worries, there is a god! On Broxton just around the corner of La Belle, there is a public parking garage that gives two hours of free parking. Free parking!! music to my ears. 

P.S. Stan's Donuts right next to La Belle is delicious. go for the apple crisp!!

1/12/08: ugh. Don't settle for Mina if Nazzy is not there. bad job
