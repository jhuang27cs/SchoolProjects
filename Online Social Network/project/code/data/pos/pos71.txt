The food here is solidly good. I wasn't blown away, but it's apparently pretty authentic. Of course, I'm no Indian food expert, but my Desi friend came with me to guide me through the meal, haha. 

We got the large naan basket, which included a sweet naan (interesting, almost dessert or pastry-like), one with potato in it, and a garlic one (my personal fave). We split tikka masala and palak paneer. I guess we didn't expect the portions to be so generous. When it's served, it doesn't even look that big, but as you're eating, you realize just how much food there really is. 

My only complaint is that the waiter was rather...not smart. He was very polite and courteous, but he was just off in some ways. He did a horrible job explaining to us the size difference between the large and small baskets of naan (something about 2 kinds but 4, 1 of each type, wtf?). We also had to wait a century to get the check, and when we were getting things to-go, he could NOT understand that we wanted to split all the dishes between the two of us.

I'm coming here again before it gets too cold to sit outside, and I'm feeling adventurous so I'm going to get everything spicy. Yeahhh boy.
