Written 10/6/08 before move to Main St. 

My wife and I arrived with another couple at our appointed time and were quickly seated. The dining room is quite small but warmly appointed. 

Our waiter was excellent; friendly, knowledgeable, self effacing, there when we needed him and not when we didn't. 

Two things at Craigie can conspire against the unadventurous. One, the menu is short. And two, they serve a fair amount of offal. 

The American Heritage Dictionary defines offal as (1) Waste parts, especially of a butchered animal; (2) Refuse; rubbish. 

Foodies will agree that this is an awful definition for what can arguably be some of the best food on the planet, especially in the skilled hands of the folks at Craigie. 

Examples of the offal on Craigie's menu last weekend: 

1. Beef marrow - offered as an appetizer. 
2. Cocks' combs - also an appetizer. 
3. Sweetbreads - an appetizer you guess? Wrong, an entree! 
4. Cod cheeks - okay, not actually offal but it sounds like it. 

The food was so good that I wished for more variety but I was delighted by my two choices, cocks' combs and sweetbreads. The cocks' combs were served as a ragout with mushrooms, in-house sausage and a poached egg. The sweetbreads were perfect as well. Served with a deliciously rich brown sauce. The only knock on this dish is there wasn't much else on the plate besides the sweetbreads. My wife had them as well and she felt a bit overwhelmed by the amount and the lack of sides. 

I wish I had the ability to wax more poetically about my first experience here. My final analysis is that it was a wonderful experience and one I highly recommend. If you love food and are willing to go out on a limb, you'll love Craigie Street Bistro.
