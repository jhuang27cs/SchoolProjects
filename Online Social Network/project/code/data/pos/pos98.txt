We've avoided this place long enough due to the overdressed crowd that it is full of, but recently dared to go in on a sunny afternoon for dinner.  Seating near the window overlooking Witherspoon St. was charming with an elegant atmosphere.

I usually spring for the interesting looking items to experiment on.  Eh, that doesn't always work out well... The place had much recommendation, therefore I had the thought to order something basic to size up the place.  Since this was mainly a steakhouse, I decided to go with the steak and fries dinner - too boring for my usual fare.

Though boring sounding, that was only until the food arrived.  The steak came out amazing, and the fries that came in a metal cup (and stayed hot throughout) were some of the best I've ever had.  The meal was full of flavor and the taste seemed to linger on for days.  The lady also raved about her delicious looking perfect seared scallops and asparagus dish.

We topped it off with an equally delicious bananas foster, another boring sounding dessert done right (while enviously watching the two businessmen eat their cool looking sorbets).

Coming back shortly after for lunch with our out of town guests, I sprung for the 21 day dry aged Delmonico steak ($37).  Seasoned and salted perfectly, this must have been the best steak I had in the last few years.  Tasting their Filet Mignon side by side, this fattier special cut was a couple more times more flavorful.

Try the steak.  Whether I felt like the low-end sirloin or their best, they did not disappoint.
