Found myself in Chapel Hill for the night, and Yelped for a Chinese joint nearby.  I have to agree with the majority who praise their food.  I had the Twice cooked pork which was a 1 (out of 3) pepper dish.  It was plenty spicy for my American buds, and had a wonderful flavor.  Beware however that the pork is dried, therefor very salty and fatty.  It was like being served a pile of 40 delicious slices of bacon.  As good as it was,I could only eat about 1/2 of the entree.  I would definitely eat here again.
