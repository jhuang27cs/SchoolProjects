Went to Rebecca's Cafe today during my lunch break today.  I have to say, my sandwich was delicious!  I had a Chicken Caprese panini (grilled chicken, tomato, mozzarella cheese, spinach, and balsamic vinaigrette).  The staff was friendly and the service was quick, however the price is a little high for my taste ($7 or so for the sandwich only).  Overall, I would definitely go back to try some different items (or even get the same sandwich), but it won't be too often.
