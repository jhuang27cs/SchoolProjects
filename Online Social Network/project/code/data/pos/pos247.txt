I tried their Bubble tea and never got the dose of Christanity that other have experienced. Seriously, I didnt have a faintiest idea that they were promoting Jesus except when I was playing one of their Brick game which said I love jesus. but there where other bricks which said "Girls for a lovely time call me at XXX-xxx-XXXX" so I think I will let this pass.

I prefer places which are vibrant and this place is definitely one. On top of that they have those giant screens which makes a complete moving picture which looks pretty cool.  University Ave. is a place I like to go a lot on a clear day and this is one of the place which makes it special (or the other way around). 

About their main attraction, The Bubble Tea. I like them without the Black Pearls. Tried their Almond and Chococlate. Remember their Almonds are pretty lethal. Wish those bubble tea costed around $2 then that would be sweeter and worthy of 5 *.
