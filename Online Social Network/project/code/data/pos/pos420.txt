I'm all about locally owned, friendly businesses and La Luna totally rocks! The staff is great- very helpful when trying to decide which of their tasty menu items you're going to try...they have outside seating, great indoor seating, and free WiFi. you really can't beat that...

I had the chicken ceaser salad and it didn't dissapoint...it was a really big salad and hit the spot! Had I not over done it with lunch I would have absolutely tried out some of the delicious looking gelato & pastries in their case for dessert.. Looks like I'll be back soon to sample more deliciousness :)
