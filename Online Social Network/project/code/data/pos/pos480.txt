I love this place. I wish it were in Chicago. I hung out there a couple times on my last trip and it was so nice, always a table available, pretty speedy internet for a cafe (not to mention totally free), and plenty of power. Every time I went in or out the people said hello, goodbye, thank you, etc. Best of all they have a great selection of teas available. 

Also, I ordered a dessert and the girl not only brought it out to me but she heated it up for me. SO delicious.
