One more wonderful Starbucks to stop in to on a clod day wandering the Ave.

Gotta hand it to the staff. This is a busy place. They don't get flustered. Students who camp, harried grads, street people, professionals snuggling, parents with toddlers. We all coem in.

The standard warm and welcoming greeting of good coffee smell and smiles stands.
