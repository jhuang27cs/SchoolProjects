Ok, once again, I did not concern myself with the dresses here.  Claiming to be a drag queen or fashion design student (same thing?) only works so many times before you actually start to believe it.  So this is me concentrating on the jewelry.

As a store, this place is pure elegance.  The jewelry is actually really original and beautiful, and No, I don't think that makes me gay.  Most of the best stuff is in amethyst, for some reason.  Go for purple.  Ok, that makes me a little gay.

The staff is very friendly and super helpful.  You can tell that this one woman really likes her job, describing it as "playing dress-up" for money.
