Carolina crossroads is one of the best restaurants in the area. The food is modern southern regional. The chefs tasting menu is usually a different style. For example, I've had southwestern and Asian (different meals). Desserts are a mixed bag. They tend to either be absolutely delicious or just okay. I recommend not going on Friday nights during the summer because they have outdoor concerts in front of the dining room. Ambience is great for dates. Service is awesome. The sommelier always has something tasty up his sleeve.
