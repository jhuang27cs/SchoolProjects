I came here for a friend's birthday dinner & it was a satisfying experience for most of us I believe. I had a harvest salad and cream of broccoli soup. The interior is cozy, quiet and spacious. It was quiet enough that people were studying here.

The harvest salad consisted of green apple slices, vinaigrette, and two slices of a delicious, crunchy raisin bread! It was definitely filling and had a good amount of dressing. The broccoli soup was warm and creamy. As a combo meal it was worth the price (~$9). 

I would definitely come here again! It's a good place for dinner and possibly lunch.
