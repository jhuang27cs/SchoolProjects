This place is pretty dear to me. I'm a regular here, and for a good reason. Many good reasons actually. 

One of its best qualities is how late they serve food until - Midnight every night. And their late night menu is not your usual bar fare. Everything from great munchies in the appetizer section to full salads, burgers, and veggie lasagna. Of course you can also score the Fries for the Boys, Nachos, Quesadilla, et al.

They have live music Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Sometimes Sunday and Monday too. My favorite nights are Thursday for the great jazz bands and Sundays when they feature a solo pianist. Food in front, beer in hand... Nothin' better.

The food is amazing - gourmet quality and an excellent selection. Especially for someone who leans toward vegetarian, but they don't discriminate. Some of my favorites include:
-The Breakfast Burrito, a more-than-hearty package of potato, eggs, and cheese. Comes with salsa. Perfect for a Saturday morning with a Bloody Mary, or any other time of any other day (it's on the late night menu!). I usually add avocado. Classic.
-The Dijon Chicken, creamy, savory completely satisfying. Sub the chicken for tofu if that's your thing.
-The Veggie Burger. Or the Eggplant Burger. Or any burger really. So good. 
-The Taco Salad. It's hearty, it's pretty healthy, and it's so so good.
-The desserts! Bread Pudding, Vegan Chocolate Cake, Mocha Torte especially. Ask for some of Dr. Bob's ice cream on the side! Expletive, that is incredible.

Drink selection is pretty killer too. They have monthly special martinis, but I usually go for their great beer selection.
-Dale Bros beer! Not only is it local to Upland, but the beer is so good! I've made many converts to their brews, from the classic Pomona Queen to their special brews like the incredible California Black Beer.
-Chimay White, and cheaper than it is at The Back Abbey a few blocks down.
-Wine Wednesday. Speaks for itself.

Obviously I love the place, and am friendly with much of the staff. But I'm trying to write an honest, helpful review. I hope that comes across.

I'm sad to see that some people have had some bad experiences, especially Mister X (I don't totally agree with all of Molly Z's review, if they run out of stuff it's because they purchase local, they're not a "wine restaurant" they are a restaurant, they don't have tablecloths at the bar tables, etc. - none of that is unreasonable). There's no denying that they had some bad experiences though.

And that's a shame. The place is a rare combo of excellent food, drink, and culture. I hope those reviewers can take some solace in that the restaurant takes those critiques and any other comments they get very seriously, and work to improve the place and their service, as any good restaurant should. So some good comes out of that. Shame it had to go down this way.

It's worth seeing for your self. It really is.
