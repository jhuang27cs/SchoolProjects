We came on a pretty busy Sunday night and we (party of 2) didn't have to wait for a table. They even moved us to a more intimate spot once one opened up. The decor is lovely , high ceilings with beautiful cream lamp shades and wrought iron chadeliers. It has a very cozy, but not cramped feel to it. 

The drinks and food are very reasonably priced. There semed to be only one waitress, 2 managers, and a food runner. But we didn't have to wait too long for anything. 

The fried catfish fingers were delicious with a spicy remoulade, an appetizer or perfect portion of you just want a little something to nibble on, and to save room for dessert. My friend had the fish and chips, which were pretty standard, nothing out of this world, but good and reliable. I had the coconut/pineapple cake. It was pretty good, the icing was a little too sweet, but that's my only complaint about the entire night. I'd certainly have the cake again.

I will absolutely be back, and possibly on my birthday because twice while we were there the owner/ manager erupted into a jubliant rendition of Stevie WOnder's Happy Birthday and encouraged the whole place to join her and brought out red velvet cake for the 2 birthday people. It made me feel special and they weren't even singing to me.

My date was a bust and he spent half the night on the phone, FAIL.
But dinner at Melba's definite, WIN.
