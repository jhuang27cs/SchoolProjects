The stores and service here is great. It also has an excellent atmosphere with all the plants and foliage, and overhangs. Plus, it has all the stores I like, so I do most of my shopping here. It isn't too expensive as some people say. There are very expensive retailers here, but there is also a wide selection of mid-ranged stuff, you just have to look around. 

Parking is also really convenient with two parking structures in addition to an enormous lot. The location could use better food venues, and by "better" I mean cheaper.

This place does have a good amount of pretentious bourgeois. Often, older shoppers strut around with one hand carrying loads of expensive clothing, and the other holding a leash to a small dog wearing expensive clothing. Plus, you know the place is for the affluent when the security guards roll around in segways.
