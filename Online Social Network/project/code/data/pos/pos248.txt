This is probably one of my fav place if not the best place for sushi. The fish is fresh. Had their Rainbow Roll and it was the best roll I've eaten. Their California rolls are yummy too. Their miso soup was good...the seaweed was thick and chewy in a good way. Great service...waiter was friendly and quick. Atmosphere was mellow. Definitely will come back soon.
