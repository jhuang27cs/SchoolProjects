Both girlfriend and pom Penny had a great day at Stanford Shopping Center. It was a nice day and my girlfriend had the itch to go shopping. Even with all the stores, I was getting bored of walking around our usual shopping places, Union Square, Stonestown, Serramonte, Valley Fair in San Jose, Hillsdale, and Tanforan. So I suggest Stanford Shopping Center and decided to take pom Penny along for the trip since the mall was outdoor. 

Both of my girls (gf and Penny) loved it. Penny loved seeing all of the other dogs and her yappy-self announced her excitement to everyone and every dog multiple times. She made a pom friend that day and found Sprinkles. Gf had a lot of fun too, LV, Tiffany, Sephora, Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus, were within a couple minute walk of each other. 

What I recommend:

-- great place to shop on a nice day
