As a student at Johnson & Wales my professors have been raving about Gracies since my freshman year. I finally had the opportunity to go for my 21st birthday.

The service was amazing. My boyfriend and I were both offered a complementary class of cava in celebration of my birthday. We ordered the 5 course tasting and there was not a single item we didn't enjoy. Our server continuously checked in with us and was very knowledgeable about the plates and offered wine pairings as well. A great experience.
