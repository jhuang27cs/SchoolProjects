I know zip-zero-nada about automobile repair.  I had a business associate recommend Mike Raisor Ford's service center and decided to try them out (even though I have a Dodge Caravan).  Wow!  They have taken great care of both my Van and my wife's PT Cruiser.  When my transmission went out last year they really went to bat for me with the extended warranty company and after 2 weeks and several inspection the replacement transmission only cost me $75.00 (my deductible).

They always give me the strait story and I never feel like I'm getting jerked around.  Thanks Adam!
