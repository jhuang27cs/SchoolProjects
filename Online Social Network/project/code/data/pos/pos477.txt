Brickway is my brunch go-to.  I know that there will always be a wait, but the owner is ruthlessly efficient at getting people in and fed and on their way, and he never seems in a bad mood.  Last time we were there, he was away from the front and another server took our party name.  I guess it failed to make it into the book because we stood there and waited... and waited.  Finally, when two girls who had come in after us were seated, we asked him why we had been passed over.  He looked in the book, we weren't there, and he immediately made a space for us to sit, all while apologizing profusely.

Every meal I've had there has been excellent.  
Service is always speedy and polite.
They have interesting specials, but the regular menu is robust enough to keep you coming back for more. Plenty of options.
Cute decor--very light and airy.

What else to say about this place?  The only complaint I have is the wait, but they're pretty good at predicting how long it will be, so you can go for a walk around the block instead of cramming into the entryway.
