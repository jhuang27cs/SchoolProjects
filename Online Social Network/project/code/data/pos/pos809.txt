The food was delicious.  I had the lobster johnny cakes as an appetizer and I wanted to lick the plate.  The sauce was delicious and the lobster was cooked perfectly.  My hubby had the cheese plate and it had crostini, three golf ball size pieces of cheese, some honey and spiced blackberry jam.  Yummy.

For dinner I had the BBQ beef short ribs on the brioche with collard greens and fingerling potato salad with bacon (more like a german potato salad).  Very good and even better the next day.  Husband had the burger which he said was one of the best ones he's had in a long time.

We saved room for dessert but there was no chocolate option other than a choc/hazelnut sorbet.  We really wanted cake. Hence just 4 stars.  You always need choc cake. 

The bar serves just wine and beer.

The service was fine, the dining room is cavernous but it was pretty full and it didn't make us uncomfortable at all.  It was last Thursday night - 8/12.

We were told they change the menu four times a year and the next night was going to be their graduation.
