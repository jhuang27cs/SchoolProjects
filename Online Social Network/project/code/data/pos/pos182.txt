Went here with a friend a few weeks ago.

Was blown away by all of the little sweets they have here. Really has a great mom & pop vibe.

Had the Elvis ice cream. The King would have loved it (banana ice cream with peanut butter swirls) and so did I.

One word of warning: GET THE JUNIOR SIZE. They fill the cup and then put another scoop on top of it, so you're probably getting 2-3 scoops worth of ice cream in it.
