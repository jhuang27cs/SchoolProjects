The baked beans here are delicious! I think I'm here everyday to get a side of them - perfect amount and the prices good. The owner is super sweet and one can tell she truly cares about her customers. I admire and respect people who care about his/her business and is passionate in the restaurant industry. I come here often (as you can tell in my foursquare check-ins lol) for lunch and order the baked beans if I'm not too hungry, or the honky tonk bowl with beef brisket if I'm hungry. Ahh.. I'm craving the baked beans as I write this review! :)
