I love Cafe Zola. I've been here a bunch of times and have never had bad food. I have had not-so-great service, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Things like not having water refilled for about an hour, stuff like that. I love all of their omelets and that they have Zingerman's bread for toast, and their amazing (though pricey) coffee. On my birthday, they gave me a free banana Nutella crepe, and I could have died happy right then. One time, I was there for brunch with my boy, and the owner, Hediye, liked a song that was playing, so she got up on the bar and started dancing with her staff. That sealed the deal as one of my fave restaurants.
