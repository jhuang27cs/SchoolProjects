Pork belly n kimchi on a Portugese sweet role? Sign me the fuck up. For only $3 it may be the best value in food. The sweet fries are amazing and the dumplings are some of the best I've ever had. Need to go back and try more of the menu. I'm 100% positive it's all incredible. Follow @MamaKimsKbbq on twitter, find out where she's at, and eat the shit out of this place. 

    Just had the spicy fried chicken. Amazing. Ill have dreams about this shit.
