I just went here for the first time and had a wonderful meal. We all had the three course "Home Grown Menu", and everything we had was delicious. I particularly recommend the burratini.

The one downside was we had to wait more than 30 minutes for our table, even though we had a reservation. It was graduation week, though, so people were staying longer than they expected. I still think they could have managed this better.
