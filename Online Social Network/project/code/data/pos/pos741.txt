Delicious and healthy!! I ordered the lemongrass chicken on brown rice. You fill out a form while you wait in line; pick your rice, meat, veggies, and sauce. The ordering process is so simple! 

The ginger lemonade is delicious too. 

Can't wait to go back and try some of the other combos. I hear they're opening a Mountain View in the Fall which is much closer to me. Looking forward to it.
