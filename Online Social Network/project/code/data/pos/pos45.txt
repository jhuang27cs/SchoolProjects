YAY for Thank You Mart!!!! The first time I walked in I was overwhelmed with the music, brightly colored wigs, vintage clothes and other trinkets but I quickly adjusted to this amazing store and you can really find some great stuff there. I got a chinese paper lantern, rayban knockoffs, and many other things from this magic little place. Even if you don't buy anything the experience is great so I fully recommend it!
OH YEAH EVERYTHING IS 3.99!
