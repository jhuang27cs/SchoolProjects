I really enjoyed EVOO.  The atmosphere was very warm and inviting.  I felt instantly calm and happy to be there when we sat down.  I had the Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc which was delightfully crisp and fruity.  I started with a field greens salad that had a goat cheese croquette to accompany it and some fresh raspberries.  It was a light and enjoyable salad.  I was excited to try the chicken they had that day but found out they had sold out.  Although I was dissaponited (it was only 7:30!) I can understand that when cooking with fresh ingredients you only have so much on hand.  I had the fish instead and although there was a bit too much skin on it for me, what it was served on (baby artichokes, green beans, olive tapenade) was a great blend.  My boyfriend had the mashed potatoes with his meal and they were so smooth and buttery I could have eaten all of his.  I wasn't as impressed with the desserts.  They were good, but almost too rich and I would have enjoyed something with a bit more flair and fresh flavor.  All in all, it was a really enjoyable meal and I look forward to going back.
