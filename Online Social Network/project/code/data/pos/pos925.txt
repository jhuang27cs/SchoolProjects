I've been getting waxed here for about 3 years and I don't dare go anywhere else for fear of getting less than "bliss"ful service. Bliss is a cute, clean, modern little spa that never fails to put me at ease from the moment I walk in.

Lexandra is super nice, friendly, gentle and she makes me comfortable during this not-so comfortable waxing. If you haven't ever been waxed on your privates before, it's kinda like being slapped then punched, then slapped again. Rrrip!

This chick is the only one I trust 'down-there' besides my doctor. Rrrip!
And she doesn't laugh at me when I scream for mommy and shout obscenities to the heavens. Rrrrrip!

I think that the prices for the waxing are reasonable and I like that they offer different options. 
the basic bikini $35
the in-betweenie $50 (which is a little more, yet a little less-than) 
the brazilian $70 (the full monty)

There's no Jacuzzi, but there is a dry heat sauna and lovely rain-like showers. I always leave with samples and goodies and smelling nice of course, and I'm in a very bliss-full mood. 

I've only ever gotten the waxing here so I can't yelp about the other services, though I hear they are lovely. The steep prices keep me from trying anything else, for now.

Tip:
Look for street parking, unless you don't mind waiting a while for valet. Bliss does validate, but valet can take forever. Plus, one time the valet couldn't figure out how to start my car so I had to walk up 4 levels through the garage to start it for him while he drove my car and me down to the street. Weird, huh?
