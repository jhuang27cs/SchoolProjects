This place does not need a long review.  Get in line (it moves fast), order a tri-tip sandwich, a basket of fries, a side of ranch, and an extra side of barbecue sauce.  DO NOT skip the tri-tip sandwich.  I seriously believe that it might be the best beef sandwich in the world...yes, the world.  I want one right now.
