9 Irish is probably one of my favorite places near Purdue. Quality is consistent, and good! Service is usually great and still very good when they're really busy. Unlike most other places, it really is a pub for the Lafayette area that doubles as a restaurant. Their beer selection is great, make sure you get a Guinness. Half pints allow you to experience their whole selection.

Get the fish and chips. It's fresh, huge (get a half if you don't eat like a cow), and never fishy.
