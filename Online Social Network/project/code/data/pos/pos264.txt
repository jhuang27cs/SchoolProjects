I was very hesitant to try Charlie's place and it took a couple months.  That being said, not I'm hooked.  While not the best food in SLO, it is quite good especially for the money.  The drink specials are among the best, if not the best in SLO.  I have had several food items here including the Super Burrito, Charlie's Burger and a chicken burrito. 

 I must say the Super Burrito was very shocking... it is HUGE!  The Chili Verde they make is quite good.  The burger is probably the best I have had in SLO for $5, very fresh and the bun is very good.  The only thing I haven't been too thrilled about was the chicken burrito, it needs vegetables.  I'm sorry, but just seasoned chicken, rice, beans and cheese makes for a very boring burrito.  Throw in some pico de gallo or something!

I would certainly recommend this place over others on this side of town, especially with the full bar.  Lets just say the Kilt won't be seeing me as often
