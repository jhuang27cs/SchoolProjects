I live in the neighborhood and have frequented this place for years.  It's a great little hole in the wall - not a place to go to for a fine dining experience, but the food is tasty, cheap and for the most part, authentic. They do have a few Tex-Mex and other Mexican-American menu items to satisfy all the gringos, but I stay away from those items and have little sympathy for those who order burritos or quesadillas and then complain about the lack of authenticity. Oh, and in response to one of the earlier comments - that was Oaxaca string cheese in your burrito, not mozzarella.  The staff are all really nice, though they can be a bit disorganized when things get busy (which happens frequently).

The tacos are really good and are cheap, but my favorite dish by far is the green chilaquiles (not on the menu, but the restaurant does make it upon request).  Order it with a fried egg or two on top - mouth-watering and big enough for two people to share.

Full disclosure - I don't eat meat, but meat-eating friends who I've taken to have all enjoyed their orders.
