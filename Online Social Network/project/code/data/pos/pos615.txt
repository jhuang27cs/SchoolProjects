The most important thing about this place is there is nothing over $5.  The burger Platter come with fries and their Gyros aren't bad at all.  I even liked their grilled chesses sandwich. Best of all, they deliver fast and free. Just promise me you will stay away from their pizza.  Overall good service and diner atmosphere.
