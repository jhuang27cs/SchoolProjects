We're on the crazy side of being vegetarians, but we're not rabbits and we don't like eating as such.  We just don't like our food to accidentally have meat on it due to the rigors of preparing food in a commercial kitchen, so we usually ask for cutters/knives to be cleaned for pizzas or the food to be prepared such that some level of care is taken to make sure that we're not accidentally eating meat.  

The people at Emma's were **incredibly** patient with our requests.  They didn't blink at all and were extremely courteous even going so far to mention that another couple comes in and regularly asks for the same.

The lady who was our server (didn't get her name though) was beyond friendly and really made us feel welcomed.  

Oh --- and the pizzas were great.  I suppose that's slightly important as well.  We'll certainly be back.
