I can't speak for the Indian food here, but I had the best falafel of my life last night at this place. The staff was attentive and friendly, and I got the strong sense that the owner was truly proud of the food he and his crew prepare. It's spring break for UW, so I had the chance to relax and enjoy an empty restaurant with great company and no pressure.

(I am reviewing the location pictured in the photo attached to this entry; it seems there are several others that may share the same name.)
