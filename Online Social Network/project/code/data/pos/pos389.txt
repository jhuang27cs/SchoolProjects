Oh Racha, how I love thee.

Too bad your new owners decided to get rid of any personality whatsoever on your interior.

But the food is the same, i suspect the same cooks are employed.  The lunch there is great, you get a little soup or salad and the price is cheaper.  The food is just as good as the likes of Thai House, but much less expensive.  Atmosphere leaves something to be desired.

I basically stick to the same items, and they're all good.  I'll name them in order of deliciousness:
1- eggplant with beef stir fry.  a little spicy and wonderful
2- Pad See Ew.  Thick, chewy noodles with meat of your choice and broccoli.  Yum
3- Yellow Curry with Chicken.  Always a sweet and mildly spicy treat.
4- Green Curry.  i just like it because it comes with eggplant.
5- Pad Thai.  Not that it's bad or anything, its just that after I discovered Pad See Ew, the Pad Thai just rarely makes the cut.
