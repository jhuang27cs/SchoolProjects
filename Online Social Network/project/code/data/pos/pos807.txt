We had a party( ~70 people) for our daughter's first birthday/anniversary-type thing and Carlos made the whole thing a hit!
He was helpful with the planning right up to the morning of the party. 
He got there early and was set up, ready to go, before our first guest arrived. 
Everyone loved the drinks.  He was fast, friendly.  
Very professional, extremely helpful and a great bartender. 

Book him for your next party!
