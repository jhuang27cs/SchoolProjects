Yes, I understand some people have genuinely gnarly experiences at USPS's. You can't excuse bad attitude. But those who complain about slow service between 4-5pm on a Friday? What the heck do you expect? It's one of the most congested times to get anything done. It's unfortunately the only time some people have during the work week to run errands like, oh, mailing packages...and stuff!? You wouldn't write a bad review for the Bay Bridge because it was slow and CONGESTED when you chose to crawl across it at 4:30pm on a Friday, would you? Thought not. Deal with it!

I had a pleasant and uneventful experience at this branch. Came on a Thursday around lunchtime, 12:30pm. One woman running the counter. She was very courteous and I saw her be patient and helpful with several customers prior to me. Including a clueless girl clutching a pile of papers wondering how to pick an envelope. Including the couple who was there just to find out how much it would cost them to mail a shit ton of stuff to Germany. Pleasant, patient, efficient, helpful. With other customers, and with me. Took me less than 10 minutes to get in and out. That's good service if you ask me. 

TIPS:

Grab a number. Try not to yank off two or three from the roll. Wait patiently. Try not to come at peak hours (read: Friday 4-5pm). If you do, don't complain about the dang line!
