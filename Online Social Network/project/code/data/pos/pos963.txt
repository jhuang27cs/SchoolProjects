i think compared to queen of sheba for some reason queen of sheba stood out way more for me.  and compared to philly well philly is still the best!  down and dirty is how i like it... 

  I have no idea what it was, maybe the dishes or the intensity of the flavors and spices... this place was pretty mild... maybe cuz we didn't ask for spicy!  regardless interesting "modern" restaurant tucked away in a shady area of harlem... word to the wise... take the train and get off at 116 and walk down... don't do wat i did and get off at 110 and walk up... it was the scariest 3 blocks i've walked ever... and then u enter into this place and breath a sigh of relief... odd huh.. .

anyway onto the food
- kategna - spicy yum, loved the cheese that cancels out the spice, i think this was my fav of the nite
- fillo pastry was also nice - lentils and filling nicely spiced and season... like the green spices to add as sauce
- we ordered for the 4 of us (WAY TOO MUCH FYI ) 1 vegetarian platter (4 choices) and a zoma meat platter (also 4 choices)

each of these dishes had a very distinctive taste that made it taste like u were eating diff things... other places tend to taste all the same with the same smooshy texture... this place was def diff
- doro wat - yeah i remember queen of shebas was way bigger and more flavorful in sauce however this was pretty moist and tender... gotta love the hard boiled egg!  how the heck did 4 of us manage to not finish one chicken leg i have no idea
- yebeg alitcha - i think i liked this more cuz of the many chunks of tender sweet lamb
- some beef thing - also pretty good, more tomatey based
- chickpea smashed - yum, good balance with the meats
- collard greens - no sauce yet held its flavor, good to balance out with all the other sauce intensive choices
- atakilt wett - very sweetened carrots and super soft, goes well with the green beans
- some other orangey runny thing

the bread was nice and moist and tons of it brought out it was impossible for us to finish...

i would suggest maybe next time ordering maybe 3 dishes less than wat we got haha

the honey wine was not a good complement to all the spicy foods, it made the wine taste bitter sweet... i liked my merlot tho... that cancelled out the spice and brought out the taste of the wine after awhile!

service
friendly but language barrier definitely apparent... they filled our water constantly which was greatly needed however otherwise don't expect to strike up a long convo with these peeps.
