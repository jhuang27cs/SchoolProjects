This is by far my favorite sit-down place to eat in University City. I went here tonight for drinks and asked the bartender for a special request, he certainly delivered. I have also been here for lunch and had a tremendous salad. I don't know what the complaining is about, I would say the staff here cares far more about your dining experience than any other restaurant i've been to in the area.
