What a beautiful park!  Gotta love the changing leaves in the fall!  You can go down the path for a nice, romantic stroll-I think it looks lovelier than the promenade, actually.  Climb on top of the ledge for a nice photo opp, and throw some leaves in the air to make it look like the movies.

On your path you'll see several cute playgrounds-with seesaws, a big red cased swing (I tried it, it's mostly for kids but it worked out), elephant seats, slides, and a very interesting sand castle-like sand pit.  There's also a huge basketball court we walked by, where we saw families bonding over shooting hoops (super cute!).

Gotta love mother nature, WORD.
