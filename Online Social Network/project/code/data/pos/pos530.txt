Food good.  Very good, large and inexpensive pulled pork sandwich.  The pork rib meal was not very good though.  Flavor good but lots of fat.  Not the type of ribs where you clean off the bone.  Good for families.  Casual, loud.  Constant loudspeaker announcing orders.  Why can't they have pagers???  Place to eat but not hang out.  Outdoor seating does not have heaters-burr.  We would go again.
