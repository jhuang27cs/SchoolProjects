Under a black light your teeth will glow, lint on your dark shirt will glow, shoe laces will glow - and if you do it right @ blacklight bowling your conversation with friends will have incandescence to it as well. Glow-in-the-dark bowling at the union is one of my favorite places to take someone I want to hang with and get good conversations going; it doesn't have the time-pressure of a restaurant & is a lot easier to talk at than your standard everybody-has-a-laptop-out-or-there-is-loud-music-blazing coffee shop. Plus, I am a totally rotten bowler so my friends always get to win! There is the thrill of an unexpected strike, a chance at playful conversation, and glow-in-the-dark smiles-- what's not to love?
