I've been to this place a few times, and agree with most of the other reviews: fantastic baked goods, so-so coffee and sandwiches. The scones are amazing, and they have some unusual items (bagels and pretzels) as well, which are delicious.  BUT now on Thursday nights Mariposa is holding a chocolate lounge, partnering with a local chocolate company, Taza. I checked it out two weeks ago. There's a menu of chocolate treats and table service: two types of hot chocolate drinks, fondue, ice cream, and tasting plates of single-origin chocolates. The place was packed at 7:30 and the servers were a bit overwhelmed but friendly. You can also buy hot chocolate mix or solid chocolate to take home. I had the Mexican-style hot chocolate, served in a small cup but it was enough to send me into a chocolate haze. Good times. I'm definitely going back to try out the other items. 4 stars overall; 5 stars for chocolate!
