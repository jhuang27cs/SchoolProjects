Came here after running the Nike Women's Half marathon, so I definitely had an appetite. On recommendation from our friend, I tried the Alameda. Two pieces of french toast with thinly sliced ham and sauteed mushrooms in the middle. Top it off with two eggs, over easy, and hollandaise sauce to top it off. The bottom has a balsamic vinegar reduction which complements the sweetness of the french toast.
