I was visiting Harvard and hungry so I trusted Yelp to take me somewhere good. Oggi was a nice place, reasonably priced with seating. I really liked the cook, he was friendly and innovative when packing up my pizza. I got the pizza with garlic an basil It was a thin crust pizza that was very satisfying, I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach because I ordered a whole and could only eat half of it. But it definitely got finished when I saw the rest of my family.
