i take my doggies to this park all the time and never had a problem...i like it better than the Rancho dog park and i think it looks pretty well maintained. people are always friendly here and i never had problem with any other dogs attacking me or my dogs :) 

all in all, not a bad place to bring your pooch. separate small and large dog areas, although i'm not sure anyone abides by that rule...i tried keeping my dogs in the small area but they were able to easily maneuver themselves to the bigger dog area, which they seem to love and no one else has a problem with.
