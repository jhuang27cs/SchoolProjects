I've had lunch at Daisy Mint twice now, when there was no crowd, happily.  The food was excellent all around.  The service was not.  Both times.  No greeting when I came in the door.  First time, no one offered me a menu, although she grunted and pointed toward the table she wanted me to use.  Long delay in taking my order.  When food came out wrong, no gracious apology, just a silent picking up of my dish to return it to the kitchen for correction.  It won't stop me from going back for lunch on my own, but it would certainly stop me from introducing my friends to the place.  I would find it embarrassing to take them to a restaurant that didn't treat us well.
