Okay the closest I ever got to Columbia University is the public library on 113th and Broadway.  But I have to say most of the my fellow library patrons were either students or faculty FROM Columbia University.  I don't know what's in the drinking water over there, but some of the nicest, most polite, considerate folks attend Columbia.  The neighborhood is even friendly.  The scholarly types smile and speak (OMG they say "good morning").  On the other hand, I can be quite disruptive.  Even when my cell phone blasts "Who let the dogs out?" during the library's most quiet hours, not once did any of the students or faculty impose on my right to be individual.  However security on the other hand...
