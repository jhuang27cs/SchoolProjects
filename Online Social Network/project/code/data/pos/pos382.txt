Great for a late breakfast (served 'til 11). 3 eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, potatoes, and coffee for $5 is a great deal and tastes great.

The diversity of the menu - calzones, sandwiches, and pasta dishes - should keep me coming back for lunch. And they just expanded their hours to include dinner til 10.
