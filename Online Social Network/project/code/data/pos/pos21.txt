Their website claims that they were named best Thai in NY state, including the city. That claim is definitely false, but they do make an effort. The food was some of the better Thai we've had on this trip... relatively authentic and definitely tasty, although lacking some flavor.

But the highlights for us were listening to the completely over-educated diners next to us (discussing world travels, of course) and watching our definitely-a-Cornell-student waitress clean tables and carry plates. I guess someone has to do it....
