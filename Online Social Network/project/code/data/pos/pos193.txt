I WILL DEFINITELY BE GOING BACK! I went to Kika Tapas with some friends on Friday after work. We were seated in a comfy round booth. The tapas, sangria, atmosphere and service were all excellent. I really liked the Patatas Bravas, Camarones a la Plancha, Berenjena Rellena and a special of the night that's named something I can't remember (it was a roll of steak, stuffed with a mushroom, cheese, spinach, blend). Our server was friendly, attentive and remained patient with a challenging group of women who had quite a bit of the delicious Sangria Royal, which is a red sangria with cava and Grand Marnier. DELICIOUS!
