I lived maybe 3 blocks away from this place for over a year and I'd been wanting to try it out shortly after I moved in; clearly, the best thing for me to do was to wait until I moved out of the area.

New developments at the office have led to me working uptown one day a week. Yesterday was that day, and I decided that damnit, I was finally gonna have me some southern fried chicken and mac & cheese from Miss Mamie's! I called in an order of their lunch special of southern fried chicken with a mac & cheese side for $7.95, and they had it ready by the time I got there.

(word to the wise: $10 minimum on cards)

By the time I got back to the office, my mouth was watering after inhaling the blissful smells that were my chicken and mac & cheese. Immediately, I dove right in starting with the *block* of mac & cheese first. Just a note about that (and the reason I deducted a star): when my mac & cheese is in a literal block form (see attached photo), I expect there to be some powerful taste of the cheese and grease variety. After all, why would there be the necessary amount of cheese and grease to hold it together if it didn't? This, on the other hand, was pretty bland. Yeah, I said it. Even with all of the rave reviews of the mac & cheese on here, I didn't think it was all that impressive.

I started to get a little nervous at this point, but once I took my first bite of the southern fried chicken, my looming anxiety evaporated. Perfectly cooked, juicy, and every bit as good as I was expecting. Even though I was full after the mac & cheese and the first chicken breast, I dove into the second and ate every last bite. This was the best southern fried chicken I've had in NYC (though there certainly isn't that much competition on that front). But I'll skip the mac & cheese next time.
