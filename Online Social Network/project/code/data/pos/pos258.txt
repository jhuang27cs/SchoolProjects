So you're out with your friends on a Friday or Saturday night having a good time. You get kicked out of the bar at 2am and need some food ASAP. McDonald's anyone? I'm not going to be so happy with that decision in the morning i'll bet. DP Dough has saved me literally once a week since it opened in Philadelphia. It seemed like all the big colleges had DP except the ones in Philly. Now we do! There is no questioning that they have the best food at 3am anywhere in West Philly especially considering I swore off eating Wawa's garbage almost 4 years ago. Get yourself DP'd with the quickness son...
