This place always has a line, but I cant complain because their cookies and hot dogs and brownies are pretty cheap. Its just simple goodness here. I am always willing to wait in line for this place. The cookies are moist and soft. Ice cream choices are dryers flavor. This is a must stop place if you are in LA and want to delicious cheap cookies or a cookie ice cream sandwich for a buck. Parking is tough!
