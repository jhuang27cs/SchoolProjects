This is a chill place to grab lunch or a drink with friends -- the decor is classy (tin ceiling, brick walls, vintage mirrors) and less fratty than their neighbor, The Village Pourhouse, and less cramped than Sip.

Lunch special for $8 is good -- any burger or sandwich plus either fries, a salad or soup.  I got a grilled salmon sandwich with wasabi mayo - reg. price on the menu is $12, so it was a bargain. Hefty piece of salmon, too. 

Also, they have a deal on Tuesdays where you get mussels, fries and a Belgian beer for $12.  I'll definitely be back to check that out. The bartender also made a fresh pot of coffee for me even though I was the only person drinking it in the bar.  

They have free wifi and a ton of outlets, too.  To sum it up: me likey.
