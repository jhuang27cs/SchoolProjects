A real clean & quaint store that I'd always stop by at during breaks when I used to work on Telegraph. They're known mostly as the store that has the Nike SB account, and I've copped some pairs without any problem at MSRP prices. The staff is real chill and by no means overbearing, which I totally dig. A nod and "let me know if you need anything" is all that's required by me, and that's what they give.
