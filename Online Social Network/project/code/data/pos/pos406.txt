I was by far more inclined to see this store hidden in hipster Capitol Hill. Not the U-District; but its a fabulous fit on the ave! 
Moksha is defiantly urban-edgy-"dirty hipster" in its apparel and accessories. I've found some really fabulous totes that are hand-splattered/bleached to vintage scarves n' shoes, reconstructed vintage dresses, and some killer metal jewelry pieces! 
Another great thing is that Moksha carries for both guys and girls. 
Prices are good! and when I mean good, I mean forever 21 competitive good! 
Give that wardrobe some nice Seattle edge and visit Moksha!
