Grendel's gets five starts for me just because of their half-off food happy hours.  500-730 and after 900, as long as you get one drink $3+, all food is half off, and while the food isn't spectacular, it is pretty good and cheaper than most food you can find in Harvard Square.

The place is pretty cozy, though it can get pretty crowded at times.  Our waitress was awesome.  All around good times.  It's the closest thing to a happy hour I've found here.
