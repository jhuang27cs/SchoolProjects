I just moved into a 400 sq. ft. apartment with my boyfriend in the Back Bay Thus, things have to be very consolidated. I was looking for a storage unit that is very close to my location so I can easily go there to get clothing or luggage. I also needed a place that I could go in and out of easily.

This place is not only in a very neat building, but it also was really easy to rent a place here. I got a good sized place for what I needed for only $70 a month.  The place is climate controlled and even fire proof!

Within 5min I had rented a place and was already moving my stuff in. The only down side to all of this is that they don't have an auto pay system. Instead you can do direct pay, check or cash. They send a paper bill to your place which seems a little old fashioned but that's alright. Overall I've been very pleased with this storage place.
