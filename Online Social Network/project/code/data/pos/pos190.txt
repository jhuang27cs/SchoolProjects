Dr. Alan Wittgrove saved my life!  His team, Tracy, are all remarkable people!  This Bariatric Center is only place you can come & not be told "Sorry we don't know what is wrong with you"  go for another test, and another test.  This Dr. can take you into surgery, fix someones mistake, put you back together the right way!  PLUS, the support group once month is FREE, they do this as part of living & leading a  righteous life.  Following the change of life, changed my life & I am over 10 years, doing well, & so thankful for Dr. Wittgrove & Tracy for saving my life!
