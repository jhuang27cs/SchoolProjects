My friend read great reviews about this restaurant on Yelp so we decided to check it out on a Friday evening. We made a reservation and arrived on time, however, the hostess had us wait a while before she sat us. We were running on a tight schedule so that's why we figured a reservation would keep us on track. The place was not busy so I'm not sure what the hold up was.

I ordered chicken breast stuffed with cheese, mushroom, and spinach and my friend ordered a skirt teak with chimichurri. I really enjoyed my dish, lots of flavor and a satisfying portion. I tasted my friend's steak and I liked it but it does not compare to my uncles cooking. He's from Argentina and invites me over for churrascos all the time. For dessert we ordered a crepe filled with dulce de leche, that was pretty darn delicious.

The staff was super friendly, our waiter was a pleasure and very attentive. I had a great dining experience. Dinner was a bit on the pricey side but the quality is good.
