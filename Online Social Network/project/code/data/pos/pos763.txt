Captain Seaweed must have loved to swim, because this is a dive.
Think a shoddy, nautically themed Mos Eisley Cantina located on the all-of-a-sudden lively corner of WIlliams and Ives. I have seen Han Solo blast Greedo in here, scattering his alien remains along the stuffed faux mako shark on the wall.  The wreckage of fake sea vessels adorn the woodwork. $1 plastic cup drafts. Weirdos, drunks, old folks, dock workers, students.  Great patio. Perfect.
