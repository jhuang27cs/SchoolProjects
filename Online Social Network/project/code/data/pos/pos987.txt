Attended a private birthday party here and Bazzaar was VERY accomodating!  The space was cozy yet had room for the party to move around so you weren't stuck in a little booth the entire time.  I was DD'ing that night so I didn't really get to try any of their drinks but my husband had the "best amaretto sour he's ever had" and that's quite a compliment!  This may be a con for some people but I did enjoy the fact that you could still smoke in there...so that was nice not having to run outside everytime you wanted to light up.  OH and this place is definitely going on the "Guacamole A-Go-Go" list because they had some KILLER guacamole!!!  Chunky, full of flavor from the cilantro and lime juice, and a good size portion to share!  We will definitely be back again soon for a date night!
