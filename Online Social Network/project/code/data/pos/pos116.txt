Oh my gosh, I am devastated. This place uses MSG?! Asian Ghetto uses MSG?! *breaks down in tears*

Uhm, anyway, this place was my favorite place in Asian Ghetto for the longest time because there were so many different dishes I liked:

#77: Creamy corn sauce with fish fillets ... omg, to die for, just try it, I know it looks disgusting in the picture but just try it!

#56, I believe, is the curry with chicken, broccoli and tofu. It isn't bad, I get it when I feel guilty for not eating vegetables for a month.

#74 is the crispy noodle... that's always the bomb. Lasts 2 meals.

#73 is the wide noodle stuff, I got it once but it was like half cooking oil half noodle, so never again.

Combo plate is delicious and cheap, I really like it, it lets me imagine I am eating something close to a balanced meal.

WARNING though... as much as I love this place, I once drank water from their dispenser and felt something brush by my teeth, and I spit out the water, looked inside and saw 3 dead bugs in it... so uhm... yeah. Might just be a rare occasion, but I never drink their water when I'm there, that's all I'll say. Regardless of that, still 4 stars. That should say something about how much I like their food! Plus, the guy is really nice to me, and it seems he is nice to everyone... so that's my experience.
