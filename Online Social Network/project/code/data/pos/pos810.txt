I love Cinnamon Rolls, and this place has amazing ones! (That don't even taste vegan!) The rolls are fresh and warm, and so fluffy! And customizable with an array of frostings and toppings. They aren't big, but they're definitely filling.

My favorite frostings are Almond and Hazelnut, and personally I like pairing them with fresh fruit toppings otherwise the rolls can be too sweet. We got a Almond blueberry roll and the daily special roll (which was hazelnut frosting, chocolate syrup, and gingersnap topping), and the Almond blueberry roll was a lot better because the daily special was just too thick/sweet with the added chocolate syrup. So if the daily special is something that has a lot of sugar on it, I would recommend just creating your own roll.

Unfortunately, it seems like they've raised their prices, because the daily specials are now $5, and a customizable roll starts at $4.75... Definitely worth a visit though!
