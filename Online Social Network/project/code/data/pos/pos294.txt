I send people all over this fine country for business and personal travel.  When I don't know the area, I turn to Yelp for advice.  Torrey Pines Town Car was the first car service that popped up for the San Diego area, and it did not disappoint!

When I called TPTC, I spoke with Najib.  He was friendly, professional, thorough, and all around AWESOME.  A few days later, I called with a need for the Anaheim area of California, and he referred me to another company in the area.  Where other companies might have just kept my business and charged the higher rate, Najib was all about the customer service.  He made sure that I would still get stellar service from their affiliate company, but didn't want to charge us the extra $$.

Upon their return to MN, I spoke with the people who were in the car.  They said that the driver was friendly and polite, and did a great job.  I will definitely be using Torrey Pines for any future needs in San Diego, and you should, too!
