Is this place open 24/7? I hope so!

After eating at Chano's, we walked over to Spudnuts and got some doughnut holes. They were scrumptious. My friend got some cookies & cream ice-cream and that was pretty good too.

Spudnuts actually kind of reminds me of Donut Wheel back home, minus all the obnoxious high school kids taking up all the tables. That's a good thing!
