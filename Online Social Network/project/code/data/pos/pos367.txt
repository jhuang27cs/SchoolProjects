Woo! 5 stars! Is that possible?

Yeah, I think when I rate a place I consider all things: experience, location, prices, and ambiance. I am never disappointed with my time here. If you want to relax and people watch, you may. If you want to go crazy and get fuzzy, you may. If you want to jump around shouting about soccer/futbol, you may. If you've lived in Ann Arbor long enough, you'd know there aren't many places for a good beer and warm atmosphere. I would like to think Conor's is one of them. 

I like the crowd here. I like how friendly the service is. I like the accents. I discovered Jameson and ginger here. The vegetable burger is great. They hold events here quite often and if you catch them it can be quite fun. No busted wallets here, but of course it depends on what you get. Fun, fun, fun!
