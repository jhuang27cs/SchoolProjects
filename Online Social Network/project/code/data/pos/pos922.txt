I'm so shocked by a lot of these reviews!! I love Zebras! I currently have 15 piercings (used to be 17 though), and have gotten all except my first lobe piercings at Zebras (although did have them gauged there a couple of times). I've been pierced by all of their piercers, so I've been there on a variety of different days, and have never had any issue with customer service. Actually people are usually suuuper nice, and if it's busy, which it always is on the weekends, they say hi, and that they'll be right with me. 

Given, it is cramped up front, and on weekends can take a long time to get back there to get pierced. Still the only place I trust to get my piercings done though!
