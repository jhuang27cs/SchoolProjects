It is true what everyone says about the time it takes to get your food. But the food is delicious, and I think it is worth it - just bring your study stuff or enjoy conversation with the person you are with. Really really fun, amazing food. I'm craving it right now!!!! Kind of pricey, so I couldn't eat here everyday. *Sadness* But I would want to. They have really good mixed fresh juices as well. OMG. love.
