I recently stopped going to dispensaries but this one is the best in LA.  I've been to several and their service and staff are top notch.  The product is great and their manager, Susan, is a gem.

It's an open environment so you can bring friends but they have to stay in a certain part of the store.  You can also bring your pet and sometimes they have doggie treats (don't worry - not that kind).
