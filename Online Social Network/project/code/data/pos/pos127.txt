What can I share that hasn't already been shared? We all know that they've got the best movies. It's in a great area. It's small but never as busy as those other mainstream theaters. But my favorite thing of all is the FRESH POPPED POPCORN!!!! I hate the pre- bagged stale crap you pay $9 for at the other theaters. 
I would've given this place one last star if the floor wasn't all sticky in the theater and it had the stadium seating. Comfort is key.
