I was looking for an eye place on my new insurance and was thrilled that this place is (1) walking distance from my office and (2) on my insurance!  Five stars just for that!  Now, of course, these two benefits don't apply to everyone...but there are plenty of others:

-- I was able to schedule an appt very quickly (within a day or two if I remember correctly)
-- They are located on the drag but they do have a parking lot in back (whew!  otherwise parking could be a nightmare)
-- the doctor was very patient with my inability to take the "poof" test (there is another test that can be done it its place - yay!  good god I hate that poof of air)
-- They have tons and TONS of frames!  Great selection.  Funky.  Modern.  Trendy.  Classic.  Simple.  LOTS of frames.  The guy helping me look for frames was also very patient and we looked at dozens and dozens of frames.  It was a hard decision to make, but I was very excited to learn that my insurance lets me get new frames every year!  So when my year is up, I'll be back to pick out another pair!
