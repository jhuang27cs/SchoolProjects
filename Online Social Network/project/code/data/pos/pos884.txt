This store has to have the most helpful knowledgeable employees on the planet. I teach art at a nearby school and have come in many times for tons of wire, masking tape, buckets, drop clothes, rope, etc etc. 

Not only do they not bat an eye when I purchase at least 20 of an item less than $2 but they give me their contact info so I can call ahead for a bulk purchase. The card is also really neat.

I am a huge fan, and super excited that it's so near to work!
