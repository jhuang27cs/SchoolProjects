FOOD REVIEW (NOT DANCING)

The Globe rated Middlesex's burger one of the best burgers in town last year.  Apparently it's on a ciabatta roll and it's off the hook.  It's the place's main attraction besides the DJ/dance club atmosphere they have nightly.

Went the other day and you know what?  This ciabatta roll burger was off the hook and was one of the best I've ever had.  I'm not even kidding.

This place smells of beer and sweaty dancing...But I'll tell you that they serve a mean burger.  It's cheap - only $9 and it comes with chips.  Too bad they don't do the roasted potatoes that Miracle of Science does (they actually share a basement kitchen, FYI).

I'll be back for more burgers.  And possibly some dancing late night.
