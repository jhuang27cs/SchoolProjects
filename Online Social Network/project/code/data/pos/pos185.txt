I love going here on my lunch breaks from work.  The store has a wide selection, helpful staff, and is very nicely maintained.  I, too, would like it if there was somewhere to sit and read but, as the store is limited in size, can't really complain about that.  My favorite part? The used section downstairs.  It is extensive and the prices are fantastic for books that for the most part look as though they haven't even been read.  If you enjoy bookstores this isn't one to miss!
