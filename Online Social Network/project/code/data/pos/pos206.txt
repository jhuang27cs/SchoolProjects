The girls and I were in the mood for something on the light side and something that screamed Western Mass. since we were on a day trip in the area.  This definitely seemed like a hippie/left wing/college hangout kind of joint.  Check out the chalkboard by the bathroom if you don't believe me.  The owners/staff are not Republicans in any manner.  

I ordered a really delicious, yet very large spinach salad.  This was a tad on the expensive side for lunch but I was thankful for the day-old brioche, which I bought at half-price and it was still delicious. My friends ordered sandwiches and enjoyed them.  The seating area is kind of small so be sure to grab a table quickly after ordering.   I loved the acoustic swing band.  More restaurants should have live bands play.  

The desserts looked amazing but we didn't order anything.  I'd like to return  just for pastries.
