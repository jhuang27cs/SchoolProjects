Salento was the spot of a great BYO with a few friends at the end of the past school year.  At the beginning of May (on a Wednesday night, no less) a few friends and I went, bottle of brandy and port in hand, to Salento, where we were graciously seated and began our night of fun and liquor. 

The waiter was a phenomenal gentleman, and we were very pleased needless to say, when he brought over a complimentary tiramisu for us with shot glasses for our brandy.  Whereas most upscale BYO's tend to shirk at hard liquor such as brandy, at Salento we felt welcome with it.

The food itself was exemplary, and Salento would be worthy of five stars even without the BYO aspect of the restaurant because the food is just that good; a friend of mine when she heard we were going to Salento remarked that the restaurant was so good that last time she didn't even drink there because she wanted to taste it sober- needless to say she was not disappointed.

The restaurant was quite spacious, and there looked to be a nice room in the back for private functions, and (very importantly) the bathrooms were quite immaculate and modern.

Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend Salento as an Italian restaurant of one of the absolute best BYO's in Philly.
