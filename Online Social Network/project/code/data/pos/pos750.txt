arguably best wings in NJ, probably up there with most. this is a little hole in the wall joint that serves great wings and cheese fries among other stuff, but since i have only eaten the wings and fries i cannot comment. just the right amount of sauce and crispiness.  the guy who runs it is friendly.  every time i go to princeton, if its open, i am getting wings.  sometimes take 50 to go and drive back to NYC.  that trip is trouble, especially if there is traffic, car smells so good that i cannot resist and end up with wing sauce all over me while waiting at the tunnel.  interesting fact - formally owned by the menendez brothers. some people like George's better, bigger and plumper wings, but there is something about Chuck's that brings me back every time.
