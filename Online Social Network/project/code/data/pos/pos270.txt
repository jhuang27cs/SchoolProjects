I had the best Tex-Mex brunch at Trudy's that I have ever had in my life. I don't remember what I ordered, but I'll describe it. The bottom layer consisted of spicy black beans, peppers and onions seasoned perfectly. On top of that was a crispy tortilla.... Then two fried eggs with runny yolks. As if that weren't enough, fresh, thinly sliced ham topped the eggs and there was a mild salsa drenching that! Just, order that. My Mom gobbled up the benedict and the service was great.
