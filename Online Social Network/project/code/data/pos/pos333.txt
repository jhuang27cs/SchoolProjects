I was introduced to this place by my cousin. He's a regular here and the girl Amy who worked there always said hi to him by name.  Sometimes we're here a couple of time a week for lunch. The sandwiches and fries are awesome. My favorite is the chicken salad club, Cuban and BBQ pork. 5 stars for the sandwiches and for the friendly staff...especially Amy. The decor is pretty plan but whatever. The food is great. 

I was just starting to become a regular here and Amy actually asked my name and would say hi to me whenever I came in. But as of  Feb 2nd, they are under new ownership and Amy no longer works there. I'm sad to see her go and I just hope the place doesn't change to much. I was in today to pic up a phone order and was a little disappointed that they got our order wrong. We ordered a chicken salad club and BBQ chicken and got a tuna salad club instead. Still yummy but not what I wanted.
