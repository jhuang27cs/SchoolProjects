I was in a desperate need of a good falafel and once again Yelp didn't let me down.

Once in the small deliciously smelling restaurant, I decided to go with the lamb gyro. I read many good things and decided to try it out, and was praying it wouldn't turn my entire mouth yellow(as stated by a few yelpers). 

I am happy to report that the gyro was deliciously seasoned and had huge pieces of lamb wrapped up inside. I couldn't tell you if my mouth turned yellow because I made it a point to not look at myself after I was done eating. I figured that if in fact my mouth changed colors, it would also change my overall enjoyable experience at Aladdin's
