Excellent spot for secret dates. This central square establishment makes the most innovative-yet-reasonably priced drinks. The food is amazing as well, i was not terribly hungry so I ordered the side of braised kale (definitely an amazing veggie and prepared very well). The "date" had the mac'n'cheese and seemed pleased. 

Always easy to get a table for dinner, a great dark ish bar to hide in, this restaurant serves an important niche in central square!
