Carvel ice cream is always very nice - rich and creamy soft serve. I swear they've got something magical in those machines.

But, it's not something I go out of my way for. Carvel is a bit pricier than your average ice cream (with good reason, don't get me wrong, like I said thems is some tasty cones), but if I'm in the area on a hot day and want ice cream, Carvel is my likeliest choice.
