I have to admit I am a fan of their red velvet cupcakes.  They are a bit heavy and their frosting is a bit sweet but I will happily devour them on any day.  Some of their other cupcakes are hit or miss. Depending on what you get, they can be dry or overly sweet but usually I just stick to their red velvet. I just wish they weren't so expensive.
