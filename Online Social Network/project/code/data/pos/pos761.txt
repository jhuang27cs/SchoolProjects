The Border cafe is a great place for cheap good eats.  It's tex-mex not Mexican food.  Great Margaritas, fajitas, fish tacos,  fresh made chips.  There are huge waits on the weekend.  Service is usually excellent.  Atmosphere is fun.  This is a good place for a large group as they have some big round tables.  Some tips are:  If you are in a rush and there's a wait, ask for the no alcohol section.  You can usually sit right down.  The mix chicken/steak fajitas are a great deal.  Lot's of food.
