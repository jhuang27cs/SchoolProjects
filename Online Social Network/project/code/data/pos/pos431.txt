There is so much to do at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.  In addition to their rotating exhibits you can always expect to have fun with the permanent displays that fill the beautiful building with educational delight.

In the main exhibit hall, expect to see the fossils and explore the wonders of energy.  A trip upstairs will take you through the many environments that fill our world with lifelike habitat exhibits.  Then, there is the hall of gems and stones that has a maze of spectacular rocks encased and lit up like magic.

If you just happen to run through the main hall and are wondering what else to do, take in an IMAX movie at the theatre.  Or visit the Burke Baker Planetarium for a show.  And always a crowd favorite, the Cokerell Butterfly center takes you into the rainforest where the butterflies will land on you - perfect for taking beautiful shots of feeding or resting butterflies on gorgeous foliage.

The Houston Museum of Natural Science is a fabulous way to spend a day out of the weather and into a journey of learning.
