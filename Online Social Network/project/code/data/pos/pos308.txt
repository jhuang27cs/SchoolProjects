I was craving a bahn mi for lunch, but working in University City typically leaves me without any bahn mi options. Rather than venture into center city for my fix, I decided to wander around on campus at the lunch hour. I happened upon Chez Yasmine at 37th and Spruce in front of Vance Hall and was immediately excited to find tofu bahn mi on the menu, along with a number of other veg-friendly options. 

Woo, that was one spicy sandwich. I asked the food truck chef to go light on the spice and he obliged, but I also made the mistake of biting into one of the jalepenos. Yowza. It was delicious, overall. The spiced ground tofu, slices of cucumber and shredded carrots were nestled inside of a delightful crusty baguette. It was very nice, and I was especially excited to have a vegetarian sandwich to add to my work lunch options. I'll definitely come back and try out one of the other vegetarian options like the Gretchen quinoa salad or the Vegetarian Couscous. The owner/chef was very enthusiastic and warm. He took my picture for his facebook customer album and it made me feel very welcome.
