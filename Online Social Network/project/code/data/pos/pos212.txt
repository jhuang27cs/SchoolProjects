The Good:
  :: location. it's near campus and near Hyde Park
  :: hours. they have good hours open for business
  :: selection of frames. my god. they have so many frames it's fantastic! these are frames you would actually want to buy, too, not junk frames. range from very conservative to very stylish
  :: optometrist was nice and pleasant to deal with
  :: employees were friendly
  :: contact lenses came in fast

The Bad:
  :: one employee didn't do a good job of running one of my eye tests, but the optometrist redid the test himself

The Ugly:
  :: none.

Would I go back?  Definitely.  This place is a great location, a good optometrist, and a great selection of frames. 

This place is IN.
