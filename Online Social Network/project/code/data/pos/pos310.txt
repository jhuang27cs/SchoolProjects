My favorite place for lunch or brunch when I'm in Cambridge.

Henrietta's Table runs on the philosophy that everything should be fresh.  All of their ingredients are from local farmers and their seasonal menu changes several times to reflect seasonal ingredients.  

A magnet for celebrities (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Bill and Hill), HT is not glitzy or hip, but relazed, homey, kind of rustic with muted sophistication.  

Everything on the menu is fantastic.  I always go with the crab cakes or an omelet.  French toast is amazing too!  Seasonal breads are baked fresh and will leave you craving more.  

One thing to note is that Henrietta's Table is very active with the Farm School - a farm in western mass. that has an apprenticeship program for area children.  How cool is that?  At your table, you will also find Farmer Cards that tell you about the farm and farmer who raised the vegetables on the menu.  Charming and fantastic!!  The front of the restaurant also has a mini retail section where you can purchase spices, kitchen gadgets and various condiments and snacks.  I've bought several "Henrietta" stuffed pigs as gifts.  

I absolutely recommend HT for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner.  You will not be disappointed.  A side note: Henrietta's Table's name comes from the owner of the restaurant, who had a pig named Henrietta while growing up.  How cute is that??
