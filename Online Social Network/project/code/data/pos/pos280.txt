*** Friday - Lunch

Dirty Pho, as Su K. calls it:
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-75-hyattsville#hrid:GSQpWsHSqfyJoAwMnZKmmw/src:search/query:dirty%20pho

This wasn't where I popped my Pho cherry, but it was the place that popped my Pho cherry's cherry back in good ol' 1991. I remember that spring day like it was yesterday. I almost jizzed my pants here that day. It's very basic, as other Pho 75 locations are. They have Pho and that's about it. No appetizers, no pork chops, nada.

The Pho here justifies the absence of other dishes though. Pho is really good most of the time. I say most of the time because, just like any other Pho places, it can be a little different day to day, and that is totally acceptable because bones and meats all don't come from the same cow. They come from happy cows, sad cows, and bikerbitch cows.

Getting back to the Pho, sit down, order, and whatever you ordered will be out in front of you in less than 2 minutes. I guarantee this and am willing to bet both of Anson P.'s thumbs on this. I've been here 4 times in the past few weeks, and it's been good to great every time. Almost the same as I remember from back on that spring day in 1991. Noodles are cooked just right, meats are nice and tender and juicy, tendon is tendony, and the broth is ALWAYS piping hot. Like burn your tongue and mouth hot. The dish of sprouts, basil, jalapenos, lime, and sometimes culantro is usually fresh. Maybe being a local chain has its merits.

Still one of my favorite Pho places in the DC area. Nice and dirty. I made a revelation during my meal here. I ordered a large #1 with NOTHING ELSE. No extra meat, no extra noodles. Nothing. I'm still so proud of myself that I patted myself on the back every 4 hours ever since until my update below.

4.5 stars
