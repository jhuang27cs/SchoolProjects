Zuzu! has a thrilling combination of fun atmosphere and delicious food. As a vegetarian, I'm always excited when I can't decide which meal I want because there are so many options available to me. My friend and I ended up splitting the dip platter, to try everything, and it was definitely the right choice. The whipped garlic, cheese and olive spreads were phenomenal. I couldn't quite believe the wondrous things happening inside my mouth. I highly recommend eating some of the pita with the cheese and olive together-YUM. I was also really impressed by how affordable the meal was, we will definitely be going back to try more of the menu and cocktails. 

PS. The waitstaff are all funky and really attractive. Bonus.
