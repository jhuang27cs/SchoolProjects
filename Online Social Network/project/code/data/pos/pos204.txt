Third time I've dined in, and I've had excellent service each and every time. Carlos, our server is incredibly courteous and is on point when it comes to timing (refills, ordering, checkups). The food is just as fantastic! My friend had the Philly cheesesteak (minus the Philly! Lol) and I had the pizza and salad...so good!! Tarantinos is quickly becoming my favorite!
