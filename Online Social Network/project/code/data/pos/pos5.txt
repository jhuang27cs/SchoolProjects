Great place! 

I have to say the menu and the outdoor seating keep us coming back.  The food is good -- had breakfast both times but some friends had lunch items. Definitely a great selection.  We've been at off-peak times so no waiting and better service. 

All in all, it's no DZ Akins but it's definitely worth trying!
