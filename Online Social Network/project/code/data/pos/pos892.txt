East-coast Pinkberry.

That's right; I said it.

It's the tangy yogurt flavor you've come to love and expect combined with fresh fruity goodness. Or chocolate. They won't judge.

Don't expect much room to sit and enjoy your coffee or froyo, but I bodily drag people here anytime I'm in the extended Harvard Square/Cambridge area and they (my friends) usually seem much less dubious on the way out than they were on the way in.
