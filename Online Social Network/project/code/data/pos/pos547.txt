I used to live in the house right in front of/behind (?) Louie's, and so I'd stop over anytime I needed some fries.  They have the best, crispy fries everrrrrrrrrr.  Love them.  Louie's used to be on my speed-dial. 

I used to get their subs for dinner on almost a weekly basis.  HOLY CRAP I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THAT UNTIL I WROTE THIS!!!!  Sigh, those were some good times.  Any sub + fries + milkshake = PERFECTION.  I recommend the peanut butter shake.  Unless you're allergic.  Then go with the classic vanilla.  Can't go wrong with that.  Unless you're lactose intolerant, but so am I - I just suck it up and bear with the pain because it's *that* worth it.

And Louie's is great because it's open during daylight AND twilight hours, so you can satisfy your cravings at any hour of the day, not just at post-boozin night-times.
