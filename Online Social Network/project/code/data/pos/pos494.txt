I ventured back to this place with fond memories of Buffalo wings.  I had been here one other time, but that must of been at least 3 or 4 years ago. Located on the second floor and roof, of what looks to be an old apartment building I was eager to relive the inherent messy enjoyment one gets out of eating these mini spicy wings.  
My friends were already seated on the roof deck by the time I arrived but said that they had waited about 20-25 min's at the bar for seating.  We were waited on promptly though, but then he kind of forgot about us once we got our food (I usually expect at least one "how is your food?" check up from the waiter).  I of course had the Buffalo wings with a draft of Old Speckled hen (they also had Brooklyn beer),  while my friends opted for the "The Heights Wrap" and "The Heights Burger".  Nothing particularly special except that they do have $3 happy hour margaritas.  Just remember that "there is no happy hour on the roof".

Oh I just remembered that I also had their "Vancouver Fries" described as: "smothered in shredded jack and cheddar" . They were indeed covered in cheese but were also luke warm and tasted as if they might have microwaved it.

Update 7/16/07: I was in the neighborhood and when I decided to give this place a second chance.  I am glad I did because there lunch specials are great.  I had the chicken burrito (which was ehhh), while my friends got the steak dishes.  One got the steak burrito and the other... I don't remember what it was called, but it was damn good.
