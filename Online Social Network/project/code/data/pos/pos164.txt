After reading a review, I want to try the fleur de sel cupcake but for now, if you love a creamy, buttery, rich frosting, try the vanilla!  It's my favorite!  It's so good that I savor it and take...10 minutes to eat the frosting!
The place is appealing from the outside with the bright pink colors and simplicity.  I appreciate that they purchase their ingredients from local vendors. 
 As far as the price goes, if you're going to a place that only sells cupcakes and coffee, don't be surprised or complain at the prices.  Just go home and make them yourself.
