i'm a massage once every two weeks type of person and around Los Angeles I have a handful of therapists that get me.  When I travel for work, I crave great massage, but it's often hard to find a good one right away.

Thanks to YELP and the  great reviews about Angela I found the perfect therapist.  Not only is she a lovely human being and phenomenal massage therapist, she is and incredibly intuitive HEALER.  It's always such a blessing to meet someone that can truly help you if you're open to it.  

Angela is so gifted in her intuitive meditation and massage.  If you stay open to the vibrational energy she provides you, you will walk out with your third eye wide open and feeling like a zillion bucks.  Do yourself a favor and go to her.
