I've been here a few times, the most recent time with a large group. We ordered a ton of appetizers and they were all really good. Also a plus is that there were a lot of vegetarian options for both meals and appetizers. I ordered the ethiopian dish and it was also really good. I also had a goat cheese cheesecake which was a little questionable, but I think that was just a limited time special. Drinks wise, order a long island iced tea. They are amazing here. It is also a nice place to go since they have live music.
