If you like Chinese food, you need to try this place.  It is amazing.  The pan-fried pork pot stickers, the sizzling rice soup, the chow mein with homemade noodles, kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, every dish has been outstanding.  They use fresh ingredients, they cook them extremely well, the flavors are wonderful, and the service is just amazing.  I've never been to a restaurant before when they remembered my name after only one visit.  I can't wait to return.  This is the kind of restaurant that makes you want to move into the neighborhood, maybe next door!
