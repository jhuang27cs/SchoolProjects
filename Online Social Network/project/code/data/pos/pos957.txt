GREAT BREAKFAST!!!

My favorite place to grab weekend brunch with friends. I dislike people who dislike headlines. How can you dislike headlines!? The portions are huge and the food is delicious and prompt. 

Can be hard to find a place to seat as it gets crowded at times, but staff doesnt rush you out or anything. 

Omelets and burgers are both very very good. OMELETS ARE HUGE, and made me forget the dorm omelet bar. Who cares about the dorms when you can get a HUGE GIANT DELICIOUS OMELET for under 10 bux.
