Guess what people, you roll the slice up and consume, did you see the illustrations on the wall above the order counter?  I guess when in Rome, some people like to think they are still at home.  

We ate at Antico tonight for the first time.  My wife and daughter were there waiting at the community table having already ordered.  Probably around 6:30pm when I arrived and joined them.  I was immediately struck by the interior.  Lots of great things to look at everywhere.  San Marzano's stacked in one corner, huge pizza ovens in the back, delicious desserts in the front, etc.  I was completely ready for this experience.  I knew that this place was not going to be "hand and foot" and I was going to have to do some work, no problem for me.  

The pizza arrived as we enjoyed conversations with other patrons at the large community table.  Everyone was interested in helping each other enjoy their experience offering tid-bits of knowledge and advice.  We got the sausage and sweet hot peppers pizza (name escapes me at the moment) and let me say from dough to tomato, HANDS DOWN THE BEST PIZZA I have had in a long while.  To boot, there are little bowls of goodness all around the table: fresh chopped garlic, shredded parm, whole peppers (hot and sweet), etc.  I would say the dough was delicious down to the last bite.  I yearned for each bite, eating like an animal, only stopping to breathe and smile.

Bring your own booze.  They are a work in progress and when my wife asked about salads they mentioned that they might have something in the near future.  I can only wait and see.
