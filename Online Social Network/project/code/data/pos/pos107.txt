We had a small dog with us so we were limited to places that had outdoor dining while at Stanford Shopping Center.  Babbo's caught our eye and we took a seat.  We had no particular expectations but all three of us were extremely pleased with our meals, mine was the Gorgonzola and pine nut pizza which was amazing.  Babbo himself even stopped by our table to chat indicating that his restaurant had been in business there for over 20 years. We'll definitely be back.

I highly recommend the restaurant and only reflecting four stars in my rating because I have not patronized the place frequently and to avoid overall irrational exuberance.  

By the way, the name plate by the door says "Babbo's Pizzeria"
