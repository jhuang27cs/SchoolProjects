The Heights is a gem in Morningside.  Buy as many margaritas as you can drink before happy hour ends!  (7pm, but watch out, they will kick your butt)

Over my years at school, I probably went there about 50 times.  It gets really crowded on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, so if you don't like that, avoid those nights.  If you are looking for a bar near Columbia on a weeknight, this is the place, as the smaller space is more inviting and comfortable.

The food is great, and I have been here for brunch, lunch and dinner.  The food is a good deal, and pretty much everything on the menu is delicious.  The guys who work here are friendly and great!

It probably deserves 4 stars overall, but since I had so many great times here, and was never let down, it gets 5.
