This is a fabulous little children's boutique.  Not only will you find unique gifts for your little ones,  breastfeeding supplies and cloth diapers, but you do so in an extremely  welcoming atmosphere.  There is a train table for your little ones to explore while you visit with the sweet and knowledgeable staff.  I have asked questions about everything from cloth diapering, herbal remedies, toxicity levels in products, etc. and they have always been able to help me.  They even have a community room offering educational classes, yoga and art for children.  They recently began hosting Holistic Mom's Network and after attending only a few meetings, I feel so empowered to make better, healthier choices for my family.  I am a Claremont resident and feel good spending my money to support this local gem.  I know that I could never receive this kind of support from one of the big box stores.
