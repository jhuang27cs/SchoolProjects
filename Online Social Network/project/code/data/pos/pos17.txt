My last trip, I took the SuperShuttle to the airport (4 am departure, blech) and the Flyway home during rush-hour traffic.

The Flyaway was the clear winner. What would I do without you? Sure, I had to wait a little at LAX, but that is expected. It was still faster, cheaper, and easier than the SuperShuttle.
