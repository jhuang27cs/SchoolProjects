They DO take cards now, with only a 25 cent charge if your order is under $10. I have gone here three to four times a week since I was a freshman..and its one of the things ill miss most about UCSD. I adore both their drinks and their pastries (chocolate croissants, if bought around 8am, are still warm!!). When I am short on cash they sell me chai on good faith, simply noting my name on a post-it to pay them back later, truly a magical place.
