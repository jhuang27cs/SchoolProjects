Picked up some doughnuts before work this morning, and Kamal had a couple of star-shaped, orange-glazed, sweetness-filled doughnuts that he called Orange Dreams.  He mentioned that he had created them for a Yelp party that never came to fruition, with the stars being part of the Yelp theme.

I find it fitting to add another one to my review of Sublime, because after consuming these treats, created especially for us, I now know what Mario feels like--super and invincible (but only for a limited time). 

The princess may be in another castle, but that just means I'll need to get more magic orange-flavored stars...
