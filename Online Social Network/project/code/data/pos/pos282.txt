I was happily impressed with this upscale chain.  They have an excellent wine list that you can sample by the glass - always an education.  And they do know how to cook a steak!  Everything is a la carte, so if you want a side with your meat, expect to pay extra.

I had the salmon bruchetta, which was almost a meal to itself.  Probably the second best bruschetta I have ever had (only the fruit bruschetta at il fornaio was better.)  The steak was cooked to perfection and the creamed spinach was excellent.  

I sat at the bar, which wasn't crowded and had excellent and attentive service.  The decor is heavy regal velvet and wood which makes the place great for a serious private getaway or a hearty business meal.  however, expect to pay a lot for the privilege.  But don't worry, you'll be pampered as much as you want.

The piece de resistance is the excellent wine list, all available by the glass or taste (1/3rd of a glass.)  This is a great place to learn about wines - they have a very eclectic selection of wines, lots of good local ones but also wines from around the world.  The wine list alone makes this a place that should be experienced at one time or another.  Where else can you compare three of the best Cabernets to three of the best Zinfandels on the market?

the creme brulee was also excellent, and I consider myself a creme brulee expert, having tasted it in over 10 states and 7 countries.  i would put it in the top 5 %.  Very creamy with a light vanilla taste and a thin crust of melted sugar, topped with some small fruit.   It was almost as good as the creme brulee at La Boheme in Carmel, the best we have ever had (alas, La Boheme is no more, but their recipe lives on at their old web site.)

I highly recommend this as an excellent steak house.  Not as innovative as Alexanders, but more down to earth American style with a better wine list.
