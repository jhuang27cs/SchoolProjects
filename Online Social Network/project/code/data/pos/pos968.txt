Sunny day and people-watching as I sat outside enjoying my mozzarella/tomato/basil sandwich. Mmmm, nice crusty bread and refills on the ice tea.  Life is good.  I'd go back to this place in a minute - especially on a sunny day!  Their pastries looked awesome but I didn't indulge.  Quite a wide selection.
