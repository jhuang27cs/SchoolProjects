Awesome, completely renovated lux hotel that used to be a bank and also church (and post office?) . Humongous room with all latest features, the closet for hanging clothes had swanky sliding glass doors! The hotel lobby/ chill area is gigantic (reminescent of a giant banquet hall and evidence of former chapel glamour). The only super odd thing was that the windows in rooms did not open and we were explained it was safety measure, done with all modern hotels. Basically, Providence has a large percentage of a crazy element as its residents and so the precaution against "incidental" suicide attempts. As for the crazy element, you'd find out what that means being here and seeing it yourself.
