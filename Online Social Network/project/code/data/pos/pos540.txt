Don't judge me for giving this place 5 stars!! Sure, Noodle Planet may not make "authentic" Asian food, and the fact that they cook Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, AND Japanese (am I missing one?) dishes might "compromise" the quality and taste of everything, the real fact of the matter is, everything I have ordered here tastes amazing and "authentic." I've tried their pho, seafood tom kah noodle soup (the only place I've found that serves noodles with their tom kah soup!), Hong Kong pan fried crispy chow mein, coconut curry with chicken, pad see ew, mint leaf chicken, etc. Basically I've tried a large variety of dishes, and everything always comes out perfect and delicious!

Service is great; the waiters here are really friendly and helpful. However, this place is cash only, but they conveniently have an ATM machine for you to use inside their restaurant. They also serve boba drinks, and I've tried their taro smoothie and Thai iced tea--really yummy. Prices are not bad at all, and the portions are really big. I love this place!!
