I love this place. It's close to work, and the Caesar chicken sandwich is awesome. The quesadillas are all pretty good too. The best thing is just the overall funkiness. It's run by happy hipsters who aren't snobby and pretentious, and the music is always appropriately weird. It's also got a good funky vibe, though the newer portion of the underground dining area is a little too bland.

Still, I usually go there once a week for lunch. Also, skip the soft drink and get the lemonade. Free refills, it's awesome, and no wasted plastic or aluminim.

It's nice to see a business that recycles pretty much everything, as well.
