One of my favorite cafes of all time. I'm afraid to give it a glowing review because I'm not sure it can hold any more than 10 people at once! A hidden gem in Westwood (I don't think they even have a sign up right now) across the street from Brew Co and next to the old Haagen Dazs. Locally-owned, family-owned tiny spot serving up fresh, homestyle, simply delicious Italian food. The pastas are great, as everyone says, and I mostly go for the sandwiches during lunchtime. The bread is perfectly warmed, with the best balance of a slightly crispy crust and softness. I crave the turkey with guacamole and the caprese! 

What's weird is that they don't post the hours on the door, and I guess Archie and his crew close up whenever they feel like it.... we've driven by at 6 or 7PM to find them randomly closed. But I will still gladly give 5 stars, because even with the strange schedule (or lack thereof), I love them anyway and will keep coming back.
