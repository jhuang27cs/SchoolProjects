The description below is right on. So when I went to Bongo Burger, I heard about this fake meat burger. I didn't try it because I don't like them no matter what, so I actually don't remember what I had, but I remember that it really didn't seem all that worth it to me. Even the fries left a lot to be desired. Anyway, why 4 stars? it's close to where my friends live and really, it's not all that bad. They could do with some specials or something like that. Competition my friends!
