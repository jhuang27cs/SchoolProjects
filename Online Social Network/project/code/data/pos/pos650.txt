I love to wrap presents almost as much as I like opening them and Flax is always first on my list when it comes to supplies.

This cute little store in Westwood is a hop skip and jump from Whole Foods. I know parking can be next to impossible in this area  but that is where  the Whole Foods parking lot comes into play:)

Flax is spacious and is nicely laid out. I enjoy spending time in here and the salespeople leave you alone unless you ask them for their assistance.

They have a beautiful selection of pens, agendas, paper, ribbons and cards but their washi origami paper is what keeps me coming back!

If you enjoy gift wrapping or have a friend that truly appreciates a beautifully wrapped gift, come to Flax, you will not be disappointed!
