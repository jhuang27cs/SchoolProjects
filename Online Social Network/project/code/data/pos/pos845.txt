Great place to watch games, great live music, great food, awful smoke, 4 stars. 

The seafood gumbo was fantastic and the grilled mahi salad was amazing. The wings are great and the BBQ burger (which I stole a bite of), was perfectly cooked with a really nice flavor.

I'd go back if it promised to be a "light smoking" night. We DC-ers aren't used to smoking in bars/restaurants.
