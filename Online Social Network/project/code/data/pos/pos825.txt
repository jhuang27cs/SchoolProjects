oh my heaven.  this burger has ruined every other burger for me since, but i really do not mind.  it is by far one of the best places i've ever eaten and the best burger.  went here twice in 3 days and was able to try the black n spicy, the tex melt, and my favorite the elvis burger.  i mean whoever decided to combine plantains, peanut butter and bacon on top of a burger (especially when you choose to go with the bison meat option) is a genius!  i have never forgotten the taste of this burger and you are never unsatisfied as there was at least 2 tablespoons of peanut butter just melting and dripping off plus roughly a half of a plantain and 2 slices of bacon.  i was so happy and have had a hard time eating burgers since...they just are not the same.  also to upgrade to the side of sweet potato fries is only going to make you happier.  go here for one fantastic experience.
