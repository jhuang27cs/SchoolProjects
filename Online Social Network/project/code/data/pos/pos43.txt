I only went here because my regular supply of the Revitalizing Shower Gel that I got from Harvest Inn in St. Helena was running low. I believe Double Tree Hotel carries their products too.

I'm addicted to the mint smell. It's $3.00 for the 1.18 oz.

I might go back and buy some of the men's cologne. The Badian has anise seed smell and the  Vetyver has spicy aroma of vetyver wood with bergamot.

I'm really getting to learn more about smelly stuff. My friends like to linger in my bedroom because it smells like tropical rainforest. I think it's a good sign when they don't want to leave ;).
