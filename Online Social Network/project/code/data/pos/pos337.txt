So, I visited this small dog joint last year... I probably should have written a review then, so as to capture the sensory details of the crackling and juices.

Now, if I recall correctly, there is no topping (my bad) this joint: the Bockwurst has a nice snap to it when you bite into it. The interior of the building is the quaint type you'll encounter along Durant Avenue, unique to Berkeley's college town, the one with age and character. I would describe it as a no-frills, more-substance-than-style enclosed hot dog stand (more than a restaurant, as it is cramped), but that is by no means a bad thing. The condiments are nice, but overall the quality of the sausage grilled atop the flat steel tabletop is the most amazing thing about the place. My memory of the place is quite fond; perhaps the crisp Berkeley air or the munchies contributed to the overall ambiance of the Top Dog experience, but there it is.

Unlike the pretentious, cookie-cutter chain restaurants of Orange County, Top Dog truly stands out. The grillmen are expert, probably from decades of experience, and take their trade seriously.
The food is rich in history, flavor, and texture; but cheap in price (a rare quality where I currently hail from---Irvine, I'm eyeballin' ye -_-).

if I ever do visit Berkeley again, I will *most definitely* drop by Top Dog and post an updated review. :)
