I love this place. I don't know how many times I've been here now but I've tried many things and liked each of them. 

Things to try:
-chef's salad with poppyseed dressing
-chili
-sandwiches

They're all so good and I'm sure I'll come back to Berkeley to visit my alma mater, of course, and get some amazing salad from Intermezzo.
