I went here for lunch with promises from my friend that I would be impressed and really like the place.
He was right.
Their Turkey Hoagie was so freakin good!
The bread was fresh, ingredients also fresh and tasty and the folks here are so friendly and polite. (A great GREAT find nowadays!)
I will be back for more.
