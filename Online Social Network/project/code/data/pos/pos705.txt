vegans unite!

I've known about this place for over 10yrs and always wondered what the deal was. I know now.

the place is kinda small but man service is fast. speedy gonazales fast. within 5 min of placing order, the food was on the table. food that fast?? kinda scares me how fast it came out but i was hungry and it was good so i didn't care.

the people that eat here are either homeless, look homeless, hipster-ish looking, college kids, or the rasta

ate the protein 2000 which was very tasty which i think was made of soy with some broccoli which i thought would have been raw tasting but it was soft just the way i like. i also had the eggplant and tofu which was good too in what seemed to in some garlic sauce. the potstickers were not great...deep fried and not panned fried.

scanned through most of the menu and it looked like things were either broccoli, tofu, and carrot combination
