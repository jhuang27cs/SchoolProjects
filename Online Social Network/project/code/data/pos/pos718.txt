Yummmm!!!! I LOVE Joes Crab Shack!!! This was our second trip there over the past 2 months. I love the fun atmosphere! We had the steampot both times, me the sunset fire grilled and my wife the diablo. Both were phenomenal! The seafood is cooked to perfection,  reasonably priced, and nice sized portions. The andouille sausage that comes with the succulent crabs is amazing!!!! 
Go To This Place!!! You will have a blast (great for a birthday dinner as the do more than just sing, they REALLY embarrass the bday victim!)
Just wish there was one closer!!!
