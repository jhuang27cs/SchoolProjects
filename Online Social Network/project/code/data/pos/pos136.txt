This place is AWESOME!

When my friend and I decided to explore Urbana, we really had little to no expectations as we had always considered Urbana kind of a ghost town.  When venturing around Lincoln Square Mall, we came upon this neat little shop with a wide array of unique kitchenware and ingredients you'd be hard pressed to find in even the most metropolis of cities, office supplies, clothing, jewelery, toys, miscellaneous (yet AWESOME) gift items, fresh cookies(!!!), just really really neat stuff!

We probably spent more than an hour looking at each and every little item in the store, and imagined how we would furnish our home with it.  

This is one place I would recommend everyone check out at least once in their college career.  I don't know how else to explain it other than... AWESOME!
