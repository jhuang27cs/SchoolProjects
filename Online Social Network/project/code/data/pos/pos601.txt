Went for Restaurant Week - enjoyed the creativity of their menu for the event! Really appreciated the wine specials to match their RW menu. Hubby didn't care for the Monday Room decor - per him it was ridiculous and painful to look at but I thought it was fun albeit a bit too much pink. His app was the bresaola, the beef had a very delicate flavor and was easily overwhelmed. Entree was the lemon olive oil poached sole, the fish itself was a bit dry & bland. My app, maple sugar custard roast apsparagus was excellent. Parmesan crumbed porter house pork chop was overcooked and greasy, but the sides helped it out. Desserts were very creative & tasty - chocolate & cardamom cake & Lemon cheesecake with roasted pineapple. Want to try the upstairs dining room next time! And I would definitley do a girls night in the Monday Room... big bar there too!
