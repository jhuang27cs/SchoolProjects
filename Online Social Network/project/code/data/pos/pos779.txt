I have been coming here since 1994, every 2 weeks like clock work, and I only let June cut my hair if at all possible. The other 2 ladies aren't bad but June's been cutting my hair for so long that I don't even have to say anything. I just sit down and I'm done in 10 mins tops.

The place itself is not what you would consider "high class"...in fact I'll be honest in that it is a little messy...there's a lot of hair on the floor, a tiny waiting area, and the sink where they wash hair isn't the cleanest. But if you want the posh atmosphere, you can go somewhere else and spend $30+ on a hair cut. If you want a cheap, efficient hair cut, this is the place.
