We're not talking food for royalty here (unlike a decent In-N-Out Double Double), but bear with me.. If the Fat Combo had a genesis myth, it would go something like this:

"And the Lord said unto Moises, 'Build thee a crust of remarkable height, breadth, and width, strong enough to bear the weight of a great burden, yet yielding to the softest of palates.  Anoint it with a sauce of tomato, and adorn it with a fine coat of mozzarella.  Call forth two of every vegetable, and seven of every delicious and savory meat on Earth, and stack them, one upon another, until thy work has stretched nigh to the gates of Paradise itself.  And ye shall call it the Fat Combo.'  Moises did as God had commanded him.  And it was Good."

Everything else there is very "Meh"; but I'm feeling generous:  5 stars for the Fat Combo, the Lord's great and terrible Instrument to strike down the gluttonous (albeit in sheer delight).  That's averages to about a 4 if you're scoring at home.

Oh, and God, in case you're an avid Yelper, I'm sorry for the gratuitous use of  Your Name without Thy Express Written Consent.
