I tried out there 7 day guest pass and I immediately fell in love w/ this place.  The moment I walked in, the facility has all the state of the art equipment, bunch of great group classes, knowledgeable staff , easy parking access, and most importantly ....very clean!    The gym's atmosphere has that feeling your at the Hyatt hotel's gym :simple , clean , & cozy.
