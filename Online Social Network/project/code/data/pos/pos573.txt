oh how i miss "the ave"  and UW!

i love this place...love the charming hole-in-the-wall style.

only downside is that it's cash-only and there is usually a long wait during dinner time.

i love their swimming rama, fried rice, and phad thai. delicious!  the service is mediocre but the food definitely makes up for it.

i think this is my favorite thai restaurant so far. i have yet to be as impressed and entertained (you can watch the cooks make the food right from your seat).

one suggestion - i wish this place would expand a bit so safety and seating isn't always an issue.
