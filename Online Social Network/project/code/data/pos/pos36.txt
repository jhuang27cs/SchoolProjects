I've been to Groove Yoga twice and was very pleased with the studio and classes - I've just been to Naushon's class - she was a very good instructor and I'd like to try some of the other teachers. I'm not a big fan of heated rooms but fortunately it is not TOO hot. Usually 90-93 degrees. The studio is immaculate and it's a nice touch they provide changing rooms, towels, tea and water. I belong to a club which offers yoga classes but the rates at Groove Yoga are reasonable so I probably will buy a 10 class card @ $12/class. Not bad considering other studios in the area charge $15 or more for classes. 

Also, I work at UC Berkeley so it is very convenient to walk over there :)

Addendum: I've been going here for a couple of months and have noticed a lot of small BUGS walking around on the floor (near the edges of the walls)! On several occasions. EWWW!!! :( Maybe they are coming from the plants in the foyer?
