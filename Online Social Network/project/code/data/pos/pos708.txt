I finally got to try a Sprinkle's cupcake a couple weeks ago when the lines died down.  After all the hype, I had pretty high expectations for the cupcakes.  They didn't necessarily blow me away but the cream frosting is definitely delish.  The red velvet cupcake is also the best.  I think I prefer the cupcakes at BabyCakes in Hillcrest but if you're in the area, definitely worth a try (but not when the lines are super long).
