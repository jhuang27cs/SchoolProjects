Great food, reasonable prices.  Got the tri-tip sandwich, steak salad, beef taco (which ends up being the same tri-tip and steak), caesar salad, and grilled chicken sandwich.  Plenty of food.  Didn't feel like fries because we'd been eating out too much.  Overall, felt full but not greasy.  One piece of advice, we ended up getting the beef taco with everything on the side (because of the way my kids eat)... well with all the parts, we ended up asking for another tortilla because there was enough to make two!  So if you are trying to feed kids or on a low budget, this works out fine.  Again, they are using the same tri-tip minced for the steak salad and taco.
