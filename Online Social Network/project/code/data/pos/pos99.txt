Until this restaurant, I'd never had Singaporean food before. I was very pleased to see that it seems to be a melding of flavors and ethnic influences (bits of Thai, Malaysian, Indian, etc.). My first visit, I ordered the Singapore Laksa, noodles in a coconut broth with chicken and tofu. It disappointed a bit, but only because I think I was expecting a lot of flavor, and the dish was relatively bland. My date had the Pad Kee Mao (Spicy Hor Fun) -- teehee, indeed, jokes abounded. This we both thought was excellent. Reminiscent of Thai Drunken Noodles, but with a different kick. The second time we came, we tried the appetizer sampler, which I definitely recommend -- it's the perfect way to get a taste of the many fusions on the menu. Staff is unbeatable -- not sure if this is a family-owned business, but it's been the same faces whenever I come in. My servers have been really sweet and attentive.

The atmosphere hints at grandeur -- plus carpeting, deep mahogany furniture. There are two rooms -- one more of a dining area, one more of a bar area -- and a nice patio around the side.
