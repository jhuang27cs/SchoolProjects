An avid Maple View fan, I was pretty devastated when I saw the Carrboro location was closing.  I need my Double Chocolate Maple View ice cream fix like I need oxygen. Really, I do.

GREAT NEWS!  Fresh Taste sells Maple View ice cream & frozen yogurt!  Frozen yogurt wasn't quite available, so I can't give an opinion on that but I'm betting it's delish.

Last night, I happily strolled down Weaver Street with my Double Chocolate ice cream cone and all was well with the world.

Prices have gone up slightly -- but still worth it, for sure.

The new owner is super nice.  Check it out!
