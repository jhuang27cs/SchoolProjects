Been here twice, spot on both times in service and food. The servers are very knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing. 

My last visit we ordered the calamari salad (7/10), spider roll (10/10 - loved it!), lamb (9/10), and the crab fried rice (8/10 - huge portion!).

Overall, a good atmosphere but it can get loud and crowded. The tables are kind of close together, so if you're claustrophobic this may not be the place for you.
