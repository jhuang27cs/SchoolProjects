I was at the mall last night and saw an add for $1.00 bar menu.
Decided to go.
Sat at a table in the bar area. There are no items on the bar menu that cost $1.00. The cheapest was $1.99. I know it is still cheap - but why advertise something that clearly you don't have.

I had the pineapple margarita, it was good but had way to much tequilla in it.

Our server was nice, very attentive and super fast.
We had the nachos, buffalo bites and spinach spread. All was good and in good portions. We were full.

Our bill came to $27.15 before tip, not bad for drinks and apps.

The only down side, there was a hair in my drink, a hair in the nachos and a hair tangled in my boyfriend's fork.

I've learned to not freak out about hairs in food that look like they come from the head. But 3 hairs in one sitting.... that is a little much.

But overall experience was the best I've had at any uno's.

I will go back for the cheap bar menu and a beer.
