Stumbled upon this place when my normal eatery in College Park was not open.  Parking can be a bit squirrely to find but it is worth the hunt when you enter the place.  Great atmosphere of an old refurbished building that looks like it has seen a lot of years worth of hungry people.  It was packed and very noisy when I hit it at about noon.  Would not be a great place for an intimate business or romantic lunch.  Other than that bring it on.  

I ate at the bar and the bartender was really cool.  Recomended the fish taco and I had it with fries....GREAT!  lots of people to watch and a very neat feel.  Great place.
