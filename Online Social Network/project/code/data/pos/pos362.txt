I've been going to Beautique Salon in Rice Village since Hurricane Ike hit Houston.  To be honest, I was without power and warm water for 12 days, and I was so desperate for clean hair, so I went in for a haircut.  Immediately, I was pleasantly surprised by the salon.  It's huge, so they were able to get me an appointment at the last minute.  Up until this point, I would never have gotten a haircut without getting lots of reviews on the person first.  However, I was desperate, so it's just luck that I ended up with someone so amazing!

My husband and I loyally go to SHARA for haircuts.  She's amazing!!!  I also get the keratin hair treatment every few months.  I switched to Shara at Beautique, and I haven't looked back to my old salon, an adorable little place in Montrose.  Shara is great at styling, and I've even tried adding color.  Basically, she's awesome!

I used to go to RAZA for bikini waxes.  She made what could be an awkward and uncomfortable situation quick and painless.  I loved her!  The only reason I don't still go to her is because I found a place that is a little less expensive.  I still haven't found anyone who has nearly as much talent at Raza though!

I go to MARCIA for facials and she is so amazing!  I'm trying to balance my dermatologist's medicines with her treatment.  My dermatologist dries out my skin, and yes, I know that's his point.  But I don't want to walk around with skin like sand paper.  Marcia solved my problem skin and now I'm all clear!  I go to her every month and I love her!

Beautique is huge, which can be good and bad.  On the bright side, you can usually get an appointment.  I also love that you can get so many services all at one location.  On the down side, because it's huge, you don't have that charming spa-like atmosphere.  If I was going to a relaxing spa day, I probably wouldn't go to Beautique.  But I would definitely go to Beautique for my regular appointments.
