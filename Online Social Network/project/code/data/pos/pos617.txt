Kind of a hit or miss... Some of the food is pretty good though. Last time I went I was truly happy with the cajan fried catfish... although some of their dishes have been too heavy or processed flavors. The chips and salsa are mediocre and the margaritas are good but overrated. Despite my bickering, this is a pretty good place everyone should try... If you like a little cajan spice, try something off the texican menu... The food prices are very reasonable, and the service is usually pretty good (fast). Anyhow, make a run for the taco bell and try the border.
