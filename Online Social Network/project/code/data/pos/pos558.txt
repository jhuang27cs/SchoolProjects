One of the best things about LG is the lovely outdoor seating. On a nice Carolina day, it's a wonderful space to hang out or do work. Lots of little tables scattered around, sunshine and shade, etc. 

You can also tell that whoever is in charge is paying close attention to customer needs, as they are often introducing new menu items and adding more seating, since this place is growing in popularity. 

The staff are friendly and the prices are the same you'd find anywhere. I come here almost daily and am so glad to have another coffee shop in Carrboro. This place can be empty at times but on weekend afternoons, good luck finding a seat---I'd recommend getting there before noon. If it's packed, just do as I do and pretend you were getting your coffee to go, anyway.
