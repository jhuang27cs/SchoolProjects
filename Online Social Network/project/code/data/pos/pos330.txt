I love Casey's Tavern:

Food is great - staff are wonderful and sometimes charmingly quirky...many have worked there for years. Burgers are fantastic and sandwiches are high quality. Yum.

Try getting a hot pastrami on rye with raw onions and Gryuere,  plus a side of their awesome garlicky ranch dressing for your fries - it will give you breath-of-death but it's sooo delicious.

My husband and I are also addicted to their fried artichoke hearts...mmm.
