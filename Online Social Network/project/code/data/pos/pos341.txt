My three month old baby had a fever and swelling.  Our pediatrician told us to take him to the E.R.  I understand the concept of triage, and hence I understand why, after baby's vitals were taken, we weren't their top priority.  The medical care we received was top notch.  Three doctors saw him, as did several nurses.  We eventually got a private room for him to sleep in.  Baby got his prescritpion and, 12 hours later, we were home.  

Ronald Reagan UCLA is ranked #3 in the nation.  The facilities are state-of-the-art, its doctors and nurses are world class.  I am grateful to have these facilities close to us.

My only criticism is that 12 hours is WAY TOO LONG for us to have been in the hospital.  We were there literally over night.  

What would make them five stars, in my book, would be for them to open a 24 hour Urgent Care facility.  That way, when those of us with urgent medical needs show up, we don't have to constantly wait for the more life threatening patients to receive their care.
