Go to the DG for your on-campus caffeine fix.  I drink only brewed coffee so I can't speak to the espresso drinks, but the coffee is always fresh and hot, and they brew Counter Culture, which is the best around.

Yeah so the inside is cramped and pretty inefficient, but it's better than the old one.  I would not suggest sticking around (unless it's nice and you can get a table outside) so if you need a spot to sit and study just take your coffee to the library or Union and enjoy it there.

Best to stop here in the middle of classes so you don't have to wait in a massive line.  Sometimes the Student Stores inside counter has less of a wait.
