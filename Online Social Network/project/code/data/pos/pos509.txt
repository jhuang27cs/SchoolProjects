I love this shop and the owner Natalie is always so helpful with offering sizes and style suggestions.  I've purchased a number of items from Groceries brand shirts to Blu Pepper blouses, printed maxi dresses and great Glam brand tops for a night out.  What I love about this store is the styles and brands are atypical.  I am able to pick up clothes that are fashion forward and reasonably priced.
