Interior is very clean, and feels cozy
food is good - not spectacular, but you can tell that it is fresh, and it's one of the nicer breakfas/brunch places in Berkeley - and huge lines are to be expected on weekends
Price is a bit on the pricey side for students, especially for breakfast, but it is one of the nicer breakfast places within walking distance (it is actually right across the street from campus) of the Cal campus
This is definitely a place that I would go if I have parents visiting from out of town - for breakfast/brunch
