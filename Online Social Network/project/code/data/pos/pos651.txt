I really enjoyed this place for lunch with a girlfriend...we were able to sit outside, the waiter was super friendly and helpful and we both enjoyed nice salads and a great lunch.

I'm not as impressed with dinner and it's def not my scene late night....but they do seem to draw a pretty big bar crowd!

Eclectic, fresh and good food!
