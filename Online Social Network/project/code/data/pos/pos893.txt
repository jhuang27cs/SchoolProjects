I stopped in here yesterday for a couple pints of Guinness, and then learned about the half-price food from 5-7:30. So, I decided to order a burger. It wasn't the greatest burger I have ever had, but it did the trick. I have had the seafood combo dinner here before, and I remember that was great! I'm sure I'll stop in here on a regular basis. I like the atmosphere, the service is pretty good, and they serve great beers. What more can you ask for? :D
