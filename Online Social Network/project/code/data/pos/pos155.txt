The B Scene at The Blanton Museum is a must-do activity. I  am a  member and miss the monthly  schedule.  Now that B-Scene is offered every other month, I supplement by attending many of the members-only events. As a member, I visit the facility to be surrounded by the beauty and to enjoy the Cafe-Bookstore.  

Today Sept 25 2010  is  Free Museum Day Event across America - go to Smithsonian Magazine Museum Day  website  to download a ticket. http://bit.ly/aeBxxE
