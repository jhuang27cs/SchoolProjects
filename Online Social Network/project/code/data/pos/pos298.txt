I lived within walking distance from this beautiful garden for a year and I didn't even know about it! *kicks self in the head*  I seriously felt more alive after walking through the roses, smelling the fragrance of the flowers and green grass, and frolicking in the cool museums surrounding it.  I have finally discovered something you can experience in LA for FREEEEEE!

I'm actually really excited to bring my sweetie here, maybe for a picnic.
