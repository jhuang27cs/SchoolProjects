I've been here twice.

First time for a dinner with a group of 8 girls, in Dec 2007. Each ordered an entree and shared a couple of appetizers. Everything was EXCELLENT!! I had never had Indian food this good.  And it was my first time having seafood prepared in Indian style. So I promised myself that I would return with my husband. He's an Indian food lover.

So we finally had that chance to go and we went for the Saturday lunch buffet.  We both thought it was mediocre. Nothing special, not different from other Indian buffets.  But the good thing was the buffet price was very reasonable too.. so nothing to complain there.
