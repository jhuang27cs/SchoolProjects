colossal margaritas, awesome tex-mex fare, reliably good service with a smile, fun crowd, colorful decor - what's not to love?  

i love spicy food in general.  they have lots of spicy food.  i'm talking, you'll be like a fire-breathing dragon after eating some of their spicier dishes, spicy!  order a glass of water w/ your margarita(s), b/c you will otherwise be tempted to drink it like the sweet treat it is then suddenly proclaim in the middle of dinner [like i did], "wow! I AM REALLY DRUNK!"  really, the margaritas are HUGE and sweet.  take your time and enjoy yours.

i have never been a fan of salsa w/ fruit in it, but they have one here that is freaking awesome.  i think it had pineapple in it?  the chickpea chili is just - OMG, nom NOM NOM!!!  i got the pico burrito w/ black beans - also delicious.  i couldn't finish it but oh my damn was it the best midnight snack later on that evening.  the menu is pretty funny w/ spanglish titles - my vegetarian burrito was found under the section titled "burritos para los vegheads," and there's one in that section titled "the angry hippie burrito" LOL!   the varied wings are listed simply as "los wingos" and while i don't remember the flavor my friend had, i remember them being very tender and cilantro-y when i tasted.  yum.  score again, mad mex. 

everyone in our party of 5 was happy, and not just b/c of their margaritas.  very tasty food and an all-around good experience.  yeah, it's a chain, but it's pretty damned good for chain fare.  i'm kind of sad they don't have any locations in the DC area.  i will definitely go back next time i'm in PA.  who wants to be my designated driver?
