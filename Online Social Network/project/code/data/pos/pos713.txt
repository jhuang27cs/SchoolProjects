Super sweet cookies and yummy ice cream.

Came here on a Tuesday night around 9:30pm.  No line to get in on this goodness.  I got an ice cream sandwich with a white chocolate macadamia cookie and a chocolate chip cookie with strawberry ice cream, while my bf had mint chip ice cream with a chocolate chip cookie and a rocky road cookie.  Cookies were fresh and the chocolate chips easily melt in your hands.  Of the three cookies - the white chocolate macadamia was the sweetest, even for a sweets lover such as myself.  They use double rainbow ice cream which is a plus and for 2 bucks a sandwich it's a good deal!

They only have 4-5 chairs in the shop and a couple benches outside.  These sandwiches can be easily eaten on the go.  Besides, cookies and ice cream, they also sell milkshakes.  If I'm in the area or craving ice cream sandwiches I'll be sure to come back.
