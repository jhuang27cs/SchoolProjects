Believe the other reviews folks - this place is an exceptionally good coffee shop with heart and friendly service. The barista who helped us (I think his name was Jeremy?) was a refreshing example of superior customer service. The art is interesting and great to check out while waiting on an order.  

My only possible complaint -- well, not even a complaint really... just something to keep in mind -- is that in such a small location, the wait maaaay be longer than normally expected during high-traffic times.  That still doesn't diminish from the score though... Just something to keep in mind.
