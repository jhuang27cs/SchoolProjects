We were walk-ins, and i was ready to bolt out the door (I hate that unwelcome, second-class lurker feeling when trying to scam a table at a "fully committed" restaurant). 

I credit the lovely waitress who saw us standing awkwardly waiting for a few seats at the bar to open up with making me stay. She greeted us warmly, gave us two glasses of water, and generally made us feel welcome and comfortable. We soon settled into our seats at the bar, ready to make it an evening. I LOVED being seated at the bar. It was better than a regular table for a jumpy, need-my-water-filled immediately type like me who hates searching for a server throughout the meal. My server was right there, behind the bar, the whole time, whirling up cool cocktails with tinctures and retro bottles of spirits. He was there when we needed him, and was so friendly and pleasant. As were the servers who brought out our 6 course vegetarian tasting menu. We aren't vegetarians, but I've always wanted to try super-elevated veggie tasting menu by a top chef, and wow, we did it! Amazing. 

But if anyone on staff is reading this: you could have served crackers and  cheese and I would have been happy b/c we were treated warmly, kindly, and sincerely by each and every person we encountered on staff. The food was flawless, but to be treated with unfailing warmth and kindness was the true magic.
