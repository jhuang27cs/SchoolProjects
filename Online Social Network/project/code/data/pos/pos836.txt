Okay, this is REALLY kind of messed up on my part.

You want to know honestly how I found out about this place??

Well so one night I was bored, watching the news online, *click here, chick there* ::yawn::

What's this?? "Steve Jobs video coming out of restaurant showing weak strength"

(This was after Steve had passed away) 

Saddened by watching the video, I then wondered where they had just come from.

Oh yeah I'm going there, you guessed it. 

I'm such a douche sometimes, I actually zoomed in, looked very closely at the door and saw that it was Calafia.

Intrigued now I googled it, found the website, location, yelp reviews....you name it. 

So as screwy as this sounds, on my initial trip to Palo Alto I had made it a pact to check this place out while I was here. I figured hey, if it's good enough for Steve Jobs it's sure as hell good enough for me. 

Boy was the Apple genus at it again, the flavors here were amazing, fresh and the vibe was VERY pleasant (granted I only had a club sandwich due to the line) but, it just goes to show you some people REALLY know their stuff in life, call me a follower but when in Rome...

Definitely a place I will add to my regulars.
