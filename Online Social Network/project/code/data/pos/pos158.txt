This place is "tha bomb"!  Seriously, I have been yearning for a proper Ann Arbor cafe, and this place fits the bill.  The owner has worked in the biz for years so this is definitely not one of those flaky "wouldn't it be cute to open our own cafe kind of places."  No air pots filled with stale coffee.  It's all made to order.  They have both espresso and "drip" coffee, ground fresh and using a manual pour over method.  Today when I stopped in they had 4 different varieties to choose from.  I went with an espresso drink: a Macchiato to be precise.  It was outstanding!
Forget those corporate coffee joints with their "grande" mumbo jumbo and frouffy frozen coffee drinks (you know who you are) and support a local cafe that takes their coffee seriously!
