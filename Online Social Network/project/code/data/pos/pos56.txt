The Blind Pig is one of the places I'll miss most now that I no longer live in Champaign. The interior is modeled after old English pubs with mahogany and dark glassed windows, but there are plenty of unique touches. I always was happy with the music here too. I can barely hear myself think in most bars, but at the Pig the music, while good, keeps to its proper place. Sometimes they have live Irish and ragtime-style music. 

The beer menu is the best in the area, with high quality drafts on tap, as well as a huge stock of bottled beers. The usually have cask conditioned beer too, which is mostly wonderful, if a little strong (the last one I had was something like 11% alcohol).
