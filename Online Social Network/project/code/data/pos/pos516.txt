Really?  No one has Yelped about Palmer?  I'm surprised.  This is such a great place filled with love, compassion and friendliness.  They have an event going on almost every night and most of the time, they are open to newcomers.  Their regular mass in the main church is very traditional and beautiful.  The organist and choir are amazing.  For the more modern folk, they have a mass called Mosaic every Sunday at 11 am in their smaller chapel, St. Bedes.  This is my mass of choice - it is complete with less archaic sermons and contemporary music with live performers.  They boast to 'come as you are' and they mean it.  Everyone is so welcoming and even if this faith is new to you, they are there for you.  There is a projection screen with the readings and songs displayed, so you are never lost.  The priests are always available for counsel after mass and they even have a prayer group present on a weekly basis accepting requests.  Every Wednesday, they have the 'great dinner' and it is all volunteers working, as is the case many of the events.  I've worked this many times - it is such a great experience filled with satisfaction and laughter.  The decor is beyond amazing and the flowers are always beautiful.  The campus is huge and they even have a place for kids to learn and a playground.  If you are new to the city and looking for a welcoming place to express yourself, learn about the faith, volunteer, pray or just meet people, Palmer is definitely the place to go for people of all ages.
