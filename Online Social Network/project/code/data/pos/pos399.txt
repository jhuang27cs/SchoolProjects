Finally a fro-yo place in Shadyside! Not that I would ever mind walking/driving to Razzy Fresh in Sq. Hill or Oakland, but always great to know that fro-yo is just a few blocks away! This place has the standard Razzy-esque fair with my fave toppings - cheesecake and brownie bits. I am odd about my fro-yo - only tart yogurt with dessert-y toppings. That's my yogurt personality and Happy Berry delivers :)
