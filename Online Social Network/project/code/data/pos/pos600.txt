The Bridge must've cost a fortune to build. It's no wonder they shy away from indie and foreign films: they've got to sell a lot of tickets to pay for all the trappings you don't see in any other movie theaters in Philly, or even on the East Coast. 

If I wanted to impress a girl, I'd definitely take her to film at this chic, tactfully designed theater in University City. The scene is very date friendly, with a lounge area and a spacious bar toward the back. And the theaters are abnormally comfortable.

The movie offerings are certainly more limited than the bigger movie theaters, though, so be sure to check the net for what's playing before your ride on over.
