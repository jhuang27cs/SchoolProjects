So I've eaten at many, many Indian restaurants in Boston. They all usually end up being very similar on 1 fact: the food tastes dulled down. What I mean by that is they cater to a non-Indian crowd, and while the dishes are still tasty they lack that extra zing and kick that comes from an overload of spice. 

Maharaja seems more authentic, they are not scared to spice up a dish, to add that little extra spice that gives it an edge versus the other indian restaurants in the city. Now, when I say this I'm not referring to how spicy the food is, I'm referring to the spice flavoring.

I started with the paneer pakora, and they were very good. Not amazing, pretty standard for an Indian place, but you can only do so much with pakora. The paneer was very tasty and they were fried without dripping with oil. 

Next, I had the paneer makhani. The paneer was excellent, and the makhani sauce was made just right. Enough spice with a hint of cream, and that fresh tomato zing at the end. Yum!

I finished with the Kulfi Falooda, which was a bit misleading. The Kulfi part was AMAZING. I have had tons of kulfi, in the US and India, and this was spot on. The taste was rich, and the icyness still present.  I was a bit mislead by the falooda. The falooda dish is one of my favorites, and there is a very specif way to make it. One of the ingredients is this white spaghetti of sorts that's mixed into rose milk. The dish we ordered had the bed of spaghetti over which the kulfi was served. I wouldn't call that falooda, and the noodles detracted from the taste of the kulfi. Honestly, if they just cut out the noodles and served an extra piece of kulfi, I would be in heaven.

Besides the food, the restaurant is very classy, located on the 2nd floor of a building, across the hall from Shabu-Ya. The decor is excellent, the ambience very nice, albeit fairly noisy. It's a large space and excellent for groups. Enjoy!
