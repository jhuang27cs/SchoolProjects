This is one of those places that I am afraid to give a good review because I don't want a bunch more people going there ;)  This is hands-down the best auto shop I've ever been involved with.  I've been taking both family cars here exclusively for the last 4 years and couldn't be happier.  Why?  Simple reasons:

PROS:
- mechanics work on salary; not comission (so they don't try to find things wrong with your car, or jerk you around with labor fees)
- front office staff is friendly, helpful, thorough, and always let you know the deal
- certifications and experience:  most mechanics are master ASE certified and specialize in only a few makes of vehicle
- if you spend as much $$ as I have there you get a free t-shirt!

CONS:
- you get what you pay for; these guys are experts and get paid a salary, but its not the cheapest place.  Then again if you get ripped off somewhere else, was the price worth it?
- they are busy, because they are good.  It can be inconvenient to wait until 5:30pm to get a call that your vehicle is ready
- not really a con, but a caveat - they only work on imports; no domestic cars

take away - this place is awesome; get towed here if you break down, or come here for regular maintenance.  I have never felt uneasy about this place and the staff is genuine and trustworthy.
