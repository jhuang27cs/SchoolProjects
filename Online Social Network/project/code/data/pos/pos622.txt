Fantastic work.  I had a bridesmaid gown & 2 pairs of jeans altered, each one came back looking great.  Also, I came in a week before I needed it all done, this was a stretch for them, but the woman I dealt with took a deep breath & agreed to have it done.  My items were even done a little early.  I will definitely come back!
