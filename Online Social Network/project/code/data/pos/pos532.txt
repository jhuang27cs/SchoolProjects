I came in here with my boyfriend and he bought $200 worth of stuff. The employees are super friendly and they even cut a deal on a vest that was kinda stained (but only because we bought so much!)
They even let us look through a barrel of shoes that weren't priced yet! MM EXCLUSIVE haha
I give them 5 stars even though I didn't find as many cool stuff for moi.
