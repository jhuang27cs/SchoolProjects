SO DELICIOUS. 

We managed to get in line right before it got crazy long (out the door and around the corner), so I have no complaints about the wait. You order first, pay at the cashier, and then pick up your food when it's ready. (As you progress through the line, you can see each pizza being made.) The staff behind the counter is friendly, nice, and they work quickly. 

Seat yourself! (The seating area is large, but with the size of the crowd this place pulls in, I imagine people get anxious about whether or not they'll find a table.)

The pizza tasted so fresh. and so YUM. Soft, chewy, thin, warm, fresh ingredients. OMG. Foodgasm. (Also, this place has the new coke/drink machine which BLEW MY MIND. soooo cool and fun to use!!)
