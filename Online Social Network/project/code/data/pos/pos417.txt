Cafe Intermezzo is probably one of my favorite salad/sandwich restaurants in Berkeley. There is a reason (or several reasons,) why there is always a long line during lunch. Here are just some of them:

-The bread is amazing (honey wheat is the best!)
-The poppy seed dressing is delicious--not too sweet and not too heavy.
-The portions are very generous.
-The variety is great--I am personally a huge fan of their egg salad sandwiches.
-Great prices.
-A side of fruit--yay!
