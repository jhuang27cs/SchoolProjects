I had a great first visit here and hope to have many more. They've got things split up with the Oyster bar on the back end and a full bar upfront. We sat at the Oyster Bar while waiting for a table. Plenty of small plates, oysters and a selection of punches and a few beers at this bar. This side is open air to the patio and is much quieter than the main bar and dining area. I could see myself having a little oyster/beer happy hour here after work.

The main dining area has an open view of the kitchen and high arch ceilings. I love the open feel and I must mention the mighty comfy looking cushioned bar stools :-) The cocktails I tried were awesome. Gin with celery bitters? OK! And the other gin cocktail with a smoke salmon garnish? Money. I loved them both and think they have a nice selection of uniquer flavors on their cocktail menu. The oysters (while I'm not expert) were absolutely perfect. The clams/pork belly appetizer is very flavorful and has a nice spice to it. Tempura green beans were good as well. 

The service was perfect. The bar tender at the Oyster Bar was very quick to take drink orders and actually explain the difference between the two bars. We were seated right at our reservation time I believe and our waitress was great. It was a full house and certainly busy, but didn't seem frantic at all. I'm excited for this new addition to the west side and based on my experience I'm sure it'll stick around.
