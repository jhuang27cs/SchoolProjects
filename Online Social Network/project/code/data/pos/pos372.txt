The place is perfect to see any band for a concert! You can't beat the price.. $20 bucks to see two bands! Pfft..come on now!  Then to even meet the band after the show.  

I think the band is getting ripped off!

If this place could clean up the bathrooms..I'd give it five stars!  I've been going here forever and it hasn't changed in about that long!  But, hey if it works..why fix it, right?
