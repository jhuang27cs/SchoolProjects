Love the 2 dollar side salad that comes with a dish! Not a fantastic salad, but pretty big and filling especially if you're sharing the dish with a friend. 

Anything not tomato-based is done strictly Paula Deen style:  all butter all the time. Chicken parmesean is pretty good, the chicken tends to get a little soggy though because it's absolutely covered with melted cheese. 

Again, if you're going to get the calzone, which I highly recommend, but don't want to wait around awkwardly standing next to the drink machine, just call ahead and pick it up. Chances are you'll wait around a few minutes anyway.

Extra star for convenience sake! 

If you're in the Asian Ghetto, this is a pretty safe bet. Avoid it during peak dinner/lunch hours as the line can get pretty fatty.

I wonder how many hours the owner works there, I see him everytime in his knitted sweater and glasses despite how stuffy and hot it gets in the back kitchen. The man must have no sweat glands.
