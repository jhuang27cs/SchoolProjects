I have to admit that I was a naysayer as I watched the sign go up for this place.  There are just tons of places in Atlanta, nay the country, that will say things like "Tony's Authentic New York Style _____" or "Paulie's Best Phillie Style ____"...it's just kinda stereotypical, and frankly, hokey.  And worse, they usually suck.  And suck hard.  

So when I saw this place getting renovated after my OC ZPizza closed up shop here (damn hippies!) in Midtown, I had the jaded thought of "great, an expensive and probably not very tasty non-option for dinner." But really, after having gotten takeout from here over 5 times, I have to admit it's gone above and beyond my expections.  Real NY style pizza?  Not quite.  Very good pizza that's quick and close by that I would order over the chains? And even over Cameli's, since I can just pick up from Vinny's, as opposed to wait for delivery?  This Lady Chinky Eyes says YES, absolutely!  Sauce isn't too sweet, the crust isn't too thick and has a good chew, and not gummy.  

And who knew, the salads here are really good when I'm just too busy and hooongry to make my own, and very affordable too.  The $5 house salad is great, really good size, and I was able to add chicken for a couple more bucks.  Take that, Fresh 2 Order - you guys are good, but I'm not paying over $11 for one of your salads again anytime soon.  

I'm still not a fan of the name (is there even a Vinny?), but this place is pretty good.
