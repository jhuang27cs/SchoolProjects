Small Italian pizzeria serving up the best handmade pizza and cannolis in the ATL.  Pizza is freshly made with all the best ingredients.  In the back room you can see the chefs slicing the sweet peppers, rolling the dough, picking the basil, you name it.  The pizza is also the perfect balance between soft and chewy yet crispy.  We had the San Gennaro and it was out of this world.  Sausage was tasty and flavorful, peppers were bursting with flavor, bufala you could only imagine. Since the pizza is so fresh, you don't feel stuffed and bloated when you're done with it.  They don't serve beer or wine but I've heard you can bring them in, not sure about the corkage fee though.  And the cannolis - you can't leave without trying one.  We bought the vanilla with chocolate chip, pistachio, and chocolate.  Chocolate was too rich; pistachio was very good but I think the chocolate chip was my favorite.   Wish I had an Antico in DC!
