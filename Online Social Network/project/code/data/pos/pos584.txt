Considering the area, I should probably give them 5 stars, but I've also only been here once.

My spicy pork tacos and basic beans and rice were immensely satisfying after months and months of life in the Mexi-free Northeast without a trip out west.  Solid home-style.  Basics done right.  Especially happy with this meal, retrospectively, after a much less satisfying brunch the next day at Ole in Cambridge.
