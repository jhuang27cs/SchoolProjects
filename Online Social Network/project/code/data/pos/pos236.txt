This is where I'd eat when I was a poor undergrad and needed a quick, cheap bite. It was either this or a donut from kingpin...needless to say, I love blondie's. It's open late night too, which can be really convenient. Some people say fat slice is better - they are wrong, it is just greasier and limper. Blondie's serves up a nice, old fashioned slice and it is big, cheap and delicious. This isn't gourmet, this is BLONDIE'S!

And in addition, this place is definitely old school. My dad has been taking me here since I was a wee one, when he'd walk me around campus and tell me "look, this is where you're going to go!" (he was right). We'd buy our Blondie's pizza and eat on campus watching the college kids go by (it was weird seeing little kids doing the same with their parents when I was a student here). The crap they have hung up inside blondie's used to disturb me as a kid. And they still do.
