(At the outset, this review is only for the vegetarian items on the buffet brunch)

So it was another lazy Saturday afternoon when a friend and myself decided to do a buffet brunch at Cafe of India...A desi (read Indian) buffet brunch is almost de rigeur for me every weekend, and mostly it is difficult to tell one buffet from the other...

Not so with this quaint lil eatery however at Brattle Street in Harvard Square...a quiet lil place with an open (not exactly street though) seating, warm and friendly service and good food!

So the buffet comprised  samosas and dosas (crepes) for starters.  The dosas were nice and crisp, made fresh by a very friendly Nepalese gentleman!  The sambar was good and the chutney passable!  Alas, the samosas were nothing to write home about - the first batch was stale samosas - which were promptly replaced the moment I complained...the second batch, though fresh and piping hot was just that!

The other items which I sampled from the buffet were the chholeys (chickpeas), aloo-gobhi (potatoes and cauliflower) and the daal makhni (lentil)...the daal makhni was REALLY good.!!  Topped with garlic naan (bread) and some rice, it was one of the more satisfying buffets I have had in Boston!

Dessert was kheer (rice pudding) and suji ka halwa (roasted vermicelli mixed with sweetened milk).  The kheer was good stuff!!!  

While I am relatively new to Boston (only 5 months), it appears that this restaurant is apparently not as well known as Bombay Club and Tamarind Bay, which seem to be more well known in the vicinity!  I am surprised at how this place has still not become popular for its buffets!!

All in all an enjoyable brunch experience at the standard buffet price of 12.55 dollars per person (tax included)...I would say put this on ur list of Indian buffets to try even if it is not exactly to die for!
