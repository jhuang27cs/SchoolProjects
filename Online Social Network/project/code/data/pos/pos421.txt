You won't be disappointed, but the rest of us already know that so if you want a seat come early because they won't last.  Save room for the beignets, freshly made piping hot little donuts, sprinkled with powdered sugar and fresh fruit.  This won't be easy because you'll want to start with a Back Abbey burger, mouth watering beef, bacon, gouda, carmelized onions, aioli sauce and micro greens on a buttery brioche bun.  It's almost impossible to resist the pommes frites, freshly made with an assortment of dipping sauces.  This place doesn't own a freezer because they don't need one and they don't believe in take-out because it goes against their ethos.  This place is about hanging out and washing al of that amazing food down with the best selection of Belgium beer on tap.  Not feeling like burgers and fries: amazing soups, salads, crabcakes, tri-tip sandwiches, and from what I hear one of the best ribeyes in town.  Not feeling like driving just yet, wander around the corner and take in a movie next door.
