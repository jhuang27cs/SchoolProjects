My husband and I were in Pasadena looking for a good meal and we were pleasantly surprised with Noir Food & Wine.  We enjoyed their prix fixe supper which they have on Sunday's.  We prefer smaller portions because we enjoy sharing and tasting as much food as possible without getting stuffed.  What topped off this meal is the two glasses of wine offered with the supper.  We're definitely fans and definitely recommend to those who enjoy tasty small portions with good wine.
