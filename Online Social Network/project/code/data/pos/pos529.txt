Do you want a no-frills sandwich that does one thing well: tastes AMAZING?  Then this is the place for you.  They have all your typical deli-style sandwiches here: the Italian, ham and cheese, roast beef, tuna, etc.  The things that make it great for me?  The Italian vinaigrette (try the "Italian Night Club" and you'll see what I mean) and the soft, chewy French bread (you can also get thick-sliced multigrain bread if that's your thing).  Top it off with a bag of kettle chips or a pickle (the whole thing, not just a spear!) and you've got yourself a very delicious and satisfying meal.
