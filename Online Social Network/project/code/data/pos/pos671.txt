Incredibly tasty food.

No matter what I get here, it is delicious. Good lord. So tasty. It's not even particularly expensive.

However, something is rotten in the state of Denmark... The host has always been rude (sometimes only hipster rude, other times raging D-bag rude), and the waiting staff has maxed out at average but normally is more mediocre.

The restaurant is small and cozy, and is a great place for a date. I hope your date has a sense of humor about the staff though (I'd suggest warning them ahead of time). Might I recommend making a drinking game out of the rudeness of the staff?

Or order take out.
