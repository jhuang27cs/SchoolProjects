I love this store! they have stylist who actually knows what they are talking about, they listen to my concerns about my figure and will work with me to find something suitable for my needs. I usually go to the sales section then ask the stylist to help me put together several looks that utilizes the items i found in the sales section. Sometimes they even have dessert platter and drinks in the fitting room. I know when I need basics in my closet, I can really count on this store, they really take the stress off of shopping for me.
