Teresa's is delicious but it can be a bit of a wait on weekends.  I haven't had brunch here, but their pizzas and pastas are delicious!  Try the balsamico pasta; I'm pretty sure it's the best thing on the menu.  The pizzas are all quite tasty and true individual pizza sizes.  Great for a date or families visiting the university.
