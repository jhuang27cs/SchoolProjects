i was so happy when i finally turned 21 my senior year and could start hanging out here regularly instead of pub.  it's super laid back and the beer is cheap.  i used to grab lunch here all the time too cause they had $5 jersey mike's subs and chips.  sentimental side note: my parents used to come drink here when they were working in the med center and dating, aww.
