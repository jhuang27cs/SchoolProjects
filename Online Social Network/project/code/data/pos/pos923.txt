Oh The Hangar, how I love you in so many ways.  Amherst was a shell of a town before you came.  Never did I know what I was missing while growing up in a town without your influence.  And then you came.  I was in college and it was the most glorious thing to happen to me before graduating.  Yeah, it was weird sometimes seeing my dad  sitting at the bar, chumming it up with the staff when I rolled in with my college buddies, but it was worth it every time.
 
The menu is perfect: big and topped nachos (don't worry, you get used to the chili in the place of salsa); the biggest potato skins outside of Idaho; fresh hot, cripsy fries (waffle or crinkle); lots of  cold beers on tap (including a $2-something Huge Coors Light); fresh, tasty sandwich wraps; endless sodas; pool; a jukebox; and that's not even mentioning the wings yet!  

Who am I kidding?  We all go there for the wings, but you know it's a good place when you can order anything on the menu with confidence.  The wings are juicy and bigger than the norm (both boneless and on the bone).  One order can have numerous flavored sauces added to it (according to how big it is).  The plates are huge enough to split and still take some home, even if you follow the sizing suggestions.  And the ambiance is a place that I can call home: pub-like with a roll of paper towels on the table.  Hey, it used to be my dad's favorite haunt, guess it was a lot like home for me.  I need to schedule a trip to visit the parents, and by "visit the parents," I mean we will eat at The Hangar.
