Based on the buffalo tots I had while doing some holiday shopping at LOVE Park a few weeks ago, I'd say I'm a fan. The sizable portion of tots I received definitely filled me up. Tossed in spicy buffalo sauce, and topped with cheese and crispy bacon, the tots come with a serving of ranch dressing to dip into.

Will certainly be back to try a burger, sooner rather than later.
