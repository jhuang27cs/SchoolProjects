Best comedy in town! Granted, it's the only comedy stop I made while I was in Boston, but I"m pretty sure no one could do it better.  This one is located in the attic of a Chinese restaurant and only 12$ to get in. BIG and LITTLE stars stand up here.  Don't miss this laugh a minute show in Harvard Square.
