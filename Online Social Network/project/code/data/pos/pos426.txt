I was worried that this place would be pricey, because it does come across as a gormet market, but as it turns out, Iwas wrong. Some things are cheaper in other stores, but I did a price to price comparison with some of the items that I buy frequently, and not only did central market beat Dag, West Side and Morton Williams, but it even beat C-Town in packaged foods, with better selection to boot.  The place is clean and well lit, s you know what you are buying, the produce is good for a NY supermarket, and the meat selection, while small, was all good quality. This has become my daily market in the area, and I reccommend it over corner grocers with inferior products.

I did find packaged asian foods to be limited and significantly higher priced than M2M over on Broadway (6.00 for dried seaweed snacks compared to 2.50 at M2M), so keep that in mind.
