Probably a 3.5 star. As a Bay Area person and someone who lived in India for couple of months, I can easily tell good from bad Indian foods. This place has a variety of traditional buffet dishes such as Chicken Tikka, Tandoori, Dals, Aloos, etc., and adheres closely with the municipal sanitary standard. If this place was in the Bay Area I could only give it a 3 star, but come on, despite LA hosts a large Indian population, the quality of Indian food here is not comparable to the Bay's. Plus 0.5 stars for the sweet services you dont normally get at Buffet establishments.
