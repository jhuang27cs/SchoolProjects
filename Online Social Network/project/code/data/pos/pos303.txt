Thanh Vi is one of our favorite places to go in the international district. The music is always hilarious (Alvin and the Chipmunks singing Christmas carols in October? I'm down), the decorations are pretty amusing (one of the paintings on the wall looks like it's Italian seaside rather than anything to do with Vietnam), but the food is definitely delightful and authentic. The servers are super nice (and if you look at the receipt, the servers have names like HappySmile2 instead of their names-adorable). 

Oh, and once, they forgot to include one of my items in my takeout order, and when I came back to get it they gave me two free appetizers and a coupon for my next visit. I love places that acknowledge that they made a mistake and proactively make it better. Try the Vermicelli, the rare beef pho, or R12 (forget what it's called but it's one of my favorites).
