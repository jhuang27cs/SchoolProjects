Aruffo's Italian Cuisine, located in the charming city of Claremont, is the place to go for an exceptional dining experience. Valerie & Tom Aruffo opened this gem in 1985, and have crafted Aruffo's into a sophisticated, successful restaurant known for an extensive menu of stellar dishes, including homemade Italian pastas, Angus steaks, fresh seafood, free-range poultry, and an array of heavenly desserts. The impressive drink menu features an extensive wine list, champagne & sparkling wine, cappuccino & espresso, cappuccino liqueurs, and various before and after drinks. The choices are practically endless.

One of many outstanding dishes is the Spinach Aglio E Olio. The various flavors fuse together to create a quite heavenly experience. Spaghetti pasta is tossed with fresh garlic and then saut√©ed golden brown with extra virgin olive oil, tomatoes, and a generous helping of fresh spinach. The complementary flavors of these wonderful ingredients come together to create a simple, yet refined dish. You will be grateful that the portion sizes at Aruffo's are so generous, since you won't be able to get enough of this marvelous dish after the first bite.

The desserts are prepared fresh daily and are fabulous. The Chocolate Ganache is incredibly rich and decadent. Your taste buds will not be the same after they are bathed in the velvety texture and flavors of this fine dessert.
