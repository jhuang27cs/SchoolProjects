I picked up some carry out for some dinner guests. Yoshi's was very friendly and patient with helping me. The food was delicious! Everyone loved the tabouli, hummus and grape leaves. I like the spacious interior. This place FELT clean, which is a huge plus for me. 

I will definitely be going here regularly. Good healthy food at good prices!
