Oh, you are so Wicked, Bass Concert Hall.  You placed your restrooms half a football field from our row.  And your Wicked ways netted us seats where we could not hear some of the words in the songs.  Well, actually, it was a Wicked friend who was supposed to get the tickets but forgot.  But, Wicked was FANTASTIC!  Hubby was wonderful and surprised me with tickets at the last minute.  

The acoustics are not perfect in row, hmmm....what was it?  Q?  Well, at least it was not double Q.  And, after reading Joe D's review, I cut off my liquid intake around noon, the day of the performance.  I did not want to stand in line for the potty for 30 minutes during the intermission (or, "half time" as hubby called it) only to return in the dark and mash down on someone toes or inadvertantly grab someone's crotch as I fumbled my way to my seat.   

The downside for me is always the parking. We left early and still barely made it to our seats because we were circling and trying to out guess where the guy in front of us would park and which garage entrance to use.  I do not understand why we can't just slip into one of those PERMIT ONLY spots for a couple of hours.  Who grades essays at 8:00 p.m. on a Thursday night in a dark and lonely office?
