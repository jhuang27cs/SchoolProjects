I went here last week to meet some friends for dinner. We were seated about 10 minutes after arrival and we had a very gracious host.They have a very comfortable seating area to wait in. Once sat, our server was very attentive and polite, the back waiters as well. The food was great, we ordered a bunch of things for the table and there wasn't a thing I could say that was bad about any of it. Good beer selection which wasn't at all overpriced, the wine list was extensive. Next time I come I'll indulge a little more. This place is great.
