My meal at River Street Cafe was THE best meal I have ever had in the Troy/Albany area, and up there with best meal ever.  I've ate a lot of pretty nice places, but the food here was so good.  The chef certainly does seem a little nutty, but it was completely worth it.  We were lucky in that we went on a Wednesday night at 6PM and there was no one else there.  We were the only party there from 6PM-8PM, which I always find somewhat awkward but it certainly made the food arrive faster.

After we ordered, we were brought a cold pasta dish complements of the chef.  This is the way pasta is supposed to be served!  It was by far the tastiest pasta I have ever had.  It was incredible.  INCREDIBLE!  We also ordered a calamari and sugar pea appetizer, that was amazing.  I tried recreating the dish at home, and while it came out well, their version was a lot better.  For my entree I had the duck with some sort of sweet dressing on it.  It was the most perfect cooked duck I have ever had, and the infusion of Asian flavors into the meal was fantastic.

5 stars for the food, but there was so much of it and I wanted to take some of the duck home.  We asked for a box and were told that they did not have boxes.  My food was wrapped in saran wrap and put into a paper bag.  I'm sure this has something to do with the chef's eccentricity, but it put me off a tiny bit.  Regardless I want to go back again as soon as possible!
