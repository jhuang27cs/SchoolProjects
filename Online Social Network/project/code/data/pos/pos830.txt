Went here with my wife as she had never been to Brazilian BBQ.  The experience was great.  After we were seated we headed straight to the salad bar which was limited compared to Espestus.  Service was good, it took about 10 minutes for the meat to come to our table but once it did it didn't stop until we flipped over out stop button.  Their meats were great and was all I ate.  I'd give this place 3.5 stars but their ambiance and location in Palo Alto rounds it up to 4.
