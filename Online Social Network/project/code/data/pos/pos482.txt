I've heard horror stories (like the ones listed below) for all of the bus companies.  I agree that they should definitely include an increased time for traffic, but neither the Chinatown buses nor BoltBus do this, so it's to be expected.  I will say customer service was a bit iffy, but the bus is clean, they provide free wifi and electricity (have had issues with buses not having those on BoltBus, even though it is advertised).  It's also the cheapest if you schedule ahead of time - round trip to NYC for $12 dollars? Round trip to Boston for $34? I think it's reasonable. 

In general, when you're schedule a bus, know when the high traffic times are and plan accordingly. You don't want a bus that's driving into New York at 7 - I had a similar experience listed below where I didn't arrive until almost 8:30 (this was on BoltBus)

Otherwise, clean and cheap way to travel!
