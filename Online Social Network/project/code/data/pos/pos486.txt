My partner and I spent a great weekend in Ann Arbor and made a quick stop into S3. The owner, Beth, was FANTASTIC! The store has a ton in it, even if it may not appear to as it has stylish, simple displays. We made a few purchases and we will be back for sure! Thanks for great shop and great products!
