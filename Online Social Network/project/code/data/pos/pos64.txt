I work here, I play here. Never get tired of it, because there's always something new. Drive-in movie nights, soul night, local bands, gay/straight/everything in between night, incredible drinks (ask TD for a 'sunburst'), and a really welcoming atmosphere. There is one rule at ZuZu -- the awesome rule. Just be awesome, rad, etc, and you'll have a great time.
