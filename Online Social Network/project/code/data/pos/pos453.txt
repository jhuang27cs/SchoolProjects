Hi, I'm Ellen and I'm addicted to Ollie's. I've spent a total of about two months in China over three trips, and eating at Ollie's is about as close as you're gonna get to eating in Beijing (at least if you're much closer to Columbia University or the 72nd St. Subway station than you are to Worker's Stadium). The whole menu is inspiring but I usually stick to a big bowl of roast duck wonton soup. That is a luscious, satisfying meal for what-- $7.00?
