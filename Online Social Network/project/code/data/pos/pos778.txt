For coffee I'd rather go to Philz. But Milano's is super convenient if I just want to study in between classes since it's so close to campus!

And I LOVE the sandwiches here. The turkey pesto is so delicious and cheesey and bell-peppery. And hot. 

I'm eating it right now. And it's $6.

Oh yeah, their cappuccino's are cute because they make designs in them. They put a happy face in mine!
