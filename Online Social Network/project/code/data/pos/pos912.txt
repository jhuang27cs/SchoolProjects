Even though I came to ZaSpa for a not relaxing service (waxing) I felt so relaxed! I was able to get an appointment the day I called. They were so nice and friendly on the phone and even told me I could use the valet parking and they would validate it. 

I arrived and they had me fill out the normal paper work for a first time visit. Then I was lead to the relaxation room with water, fruit, comfy chairs and relaxing music. I was offered a robe and locker for my purse but declinded since it was facial waxing. I sat there for about 5 minutes. Then I was escorted back to the room where my waxing would happen. The room was very relaxing also. The tables you lay on are heated! Even in the summer it was wonderful. There was also a tiny crystal chandilier in the room. It made me feel fancy.

The waxing was as painless as it can be. My waxer knew everything to ask about what type works on me and exactly where I wanted waxed. She was great! Felt very comfortable. And she put that stuff on after to make your face not hurt as much after your hair has been torn out of your face. 

She also let me know that if you use the spa you can use the pool! Which was packed when I was there with  a bodyguard outside so you can't pool crash. 

The prices were very reasonable. They were what I expected. They do add a service charge which equaled to be able what I would have tipped so I didn't mind.

I will be back!
