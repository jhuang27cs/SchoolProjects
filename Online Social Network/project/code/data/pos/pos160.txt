Stopped in for lunch with fears that I'd be here longer than my lunch break would allow. I was pleasantly surprised though that I was in and out the door in less than 30 mins (12:10ish - 12:30) even with the dining room fairly crowded. The combination bento box, although slightly pricey at $13, was really tasty. Although others complained of poor service, my waitress was very attentive and even the sushi chef stopped by to ask how things were.
