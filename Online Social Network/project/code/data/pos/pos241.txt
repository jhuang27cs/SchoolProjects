I recently commissioned three rings from Kerry Cohagen and was very pleased with the outcome.  The rings in question were an engagement and two wedding rings, very important.  Kerry listened to what we liked in terms of design and worked with us to fashion something unique and distinctly 'us'.  He used the idea of a mobius strip to create an interlocking engagement and wedding ring set for my sweetie and the result was elegant, organic, and truely a one of a kind.  My ring was simpler but elegant as well.  

We were so happy that he was willing to melt down old scrap gold and jewelry for us (including a few gold teeth) to form the jewelry as we wanted to minimize our impact on gold mining.  We came away with an amazing product for a really really reasonable price and couldn't be happier.  I would highly recommend these guys for any project.  They are artists of the highest caliber and really listen to the customer.
