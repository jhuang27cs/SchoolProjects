I am a Mexican food connoisseur - and this is, by far, the best Mexican place in Chapel Hill. Everything they have comes out fast, fresh, and is delicious.

The service is wonderful, they have free WI-FI (so you can get work done over lunch), and more and more! 

Seriously, I love Cinco De Mayo. I would recommend it to anyone.

Get the Arroz con Pollo - it's my favorite. :)
