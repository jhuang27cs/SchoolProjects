I'm very fond of this place. Not necessarily because the museum offers things that you've never seen before (everyone has seen the movie) it's more for the small perks. The biggest one being that it offers some of the greatest peeing destinations around downtown. The trees offer protection from on coming passerbys in addition to soaking up the "evidence". Doing all this late at night makes you feel a little bit like you're a part of recreated history. Who doesn't love that.
