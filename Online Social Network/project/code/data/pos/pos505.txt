Sometime in the middle of the 20th century:
"Hello? Barbers' Emporium? I'll take one of the Complete Barbershop Starter Kits, with paneling style #1. What you only have one style? Perfect."

Really, every true barber (you know, the ones with the stripey pole) I've been to has the same hue of tasteless wood paneling and the same drab color palette for every other accoutrement. Custom Barber Shop doesn't stray from the herd, and that's probably a good thing.

They're no nonsense, and will give you exactly what you want. I went in there on my lunch break, asked for a simple buzz trim, and they obliged. My hair deserved much more, and they probably could have done a gorgeous cut with scissors, but I asked for the buzzer, and they didn't try to talk me out of it.

$13 for a basic cut (I suppose that could get you most of the way to dinner at Fire & Ice, but a visit there would be, how to you say, more transient), and the location is super-convenient for those out and about in the Square.
