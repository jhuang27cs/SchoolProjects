Darn good breakfast food! And adorable atmosphere, definitely a unique place everyone should experience. The food is pretty heavy because, well, thats the point, so you usually leave feeling kinda tired and heavy but the flavors make it worth it. The french toast is something to die for, but basically everything is delish!
