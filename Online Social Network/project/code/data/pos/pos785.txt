Go for the Jazz singer, stay for the food!

We chose to eat at a table in the bar area, since the wonderful blonde singer (Kim, I'm told) drew our attention as we came into the place. This was more comfortable than a typical 'eat at the bar' experience. With its eclectic, exotic style, you feel like you've been somewhere special. 

The excellent musical trio fit this atmosphere. The female vocalist's stylish edge fit the image of a jazz bombshell, and her voice reminded you how the classics got that way -- could have stayed all night.  

The food did not disappoint. The serving of spicy shrimp and sesame chicken was immense, took half home. It was delicately spiced with perfectly cooked (crisp) vegetables. The option for brown rice is a nice, healthy addition. My friend had the duck, which I think was an appetizer; it was not as large a serving, but superb in the taste department. We had martinis. Ruby Red is delicious; they are rather small for the price, but after a couple, who's counting?

Overall, we enjoyed a great night at Jacky's Waterplace. The large dining room is beautiful, and we'll sit out there next time, maybe with a group.
