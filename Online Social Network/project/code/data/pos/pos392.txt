Outstanding!  Went to legume bistro on Friday and was so impressed with knowledgeable service and wonderful, unique food.  

We started with the Feta Broiled with Pepper Jelly.  I had merely a taste as I has order soup.  But my dining companion thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer.  Moving onto the soup...Nettle Soup with Creme Fraiche and Croutons.  Wow!  Something I have never had and was amazed that such an ill sounding plant can be transformed into a smooth, delicate soup.  For entrees, we had Montauk Scallops w/ Farro Crouton, Bird Egg Beans, Chickweed and Ramp Pesto (woooo strong stuff smoochers beware!) and Lamb Shoulder Chop Braised in Wine with Polenta and Saut√©ed Wild Greens (the lamb was grass fed and had a newer, different flavor).  Both were superb!  Loved the tender seafood and lamb (although I just had a small sample as I am not a big meat eater).  I did love the polenta that I had more than my fair share. 

Although quite pleased and fully satisfied, we ordered coffee (French press!) and the ricotta stuff crepe with honey, mint and grapefruit.  The mix of flavors was great. Oh try the ginger beer for something different
I will definitely be  repeat offender when it comes to legume bistro....I do hope the new location has as much charm and continues serving great, sustainable (yes!!) food. 

Oh BYOB and call as soon as you know a night you want to go as their reservations fill up fast!
