This museum rocks, especially for a university.  A few friends and I had so much fun wandering the place.  Loads bigger than it looks, Krannert offers everything from Gaugin to modern mulit-media installations.  There's a great one about baggage right now.

Went for a friend; she was opening her MFA exhibition.  One half star knocked off 'cuz was extra-tempted by her claims of wine.  Sadly, they only served soda.  Any art opening should have wine, people.  That's how you tempt folks into gettin' a little culture.

The other half star knocked off because the security guard followed us around like he thought we'd stolen his puppy.  C'mon, you don't expect to see oddly dressed mofos at an art opening, guy?  The fact one of our party was a 60 year old librarian (who really looks like a librarian!) didn't tip you off that we weren't there to rob the place or splash mud on the older works?
