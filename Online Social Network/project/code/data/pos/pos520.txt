This place is a diamond in the rough! I fulfilled my lifelong dream of listening to the Vienna philharmonic orchestra here, as well as performances by National Russian ballet and other high profile orchestras from all over the world.

And of you are a student of U of I, it is cheap too! You're regular concert is $2 to $10 ($2! One third a movie ticket! OMG!), and I got the Vienna philharmonic ticket for $40. No where else you can get a ticket to such a high profile event with such a cheap price.
