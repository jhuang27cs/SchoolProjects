This was my favorite Korean restaurant to go to as a student.  I'm sure now that I've experienced other Korean food, I might go back and change my mind, but I'm going off of when I was a student.  I used to get the rice noodles + ramen here and enjoy all the pancham and tea.  I really liked that the restaurant was a little mom and pop restaurant, because I saw the same man and woman there every time I went
