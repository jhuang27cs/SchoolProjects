I was really impressed with the service provided by Burden Busters.  Not only were my offices professionally maintained, but this is the first company that stands behind their satisfaction guaranteed policy.  unbeknownst  to me, the owner of the company came out to personally survey the services rendered.  Workers were always on time and polite.  Being a former Marine, I was utterly impressed and overwhelmed with their personal appearance. 

Keep up the good work,
