I like the fact that they have chorizo as a meat option for burritos/tacos/quesadilla/etc.  It is cheaper than Chipotle (~$4-5 for burrito with guac here vs. $7-8 for burrito with guac in Chipotle), and it has lots of options for toppings (chipotle salsa, pickled carrots) that you can add yourself.  Service was also fast.

Had the grilled chicken burrito with whole wheat tortilla (a big plus!).  Very tasty!  Also cheese nachos with the aforementioned toppings.  It is decent like any other regular nachos, so nothing to rave about that.

Minor complaints are the guacamole is a little too mushy (I like chunkier guac, ha!), and the service was just slightly unpleasant  as the servers were kinda pushy.
