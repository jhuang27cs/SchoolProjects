I was never a pack-a-day person but there was a time when I veered dangerously close. I also had a cigarette-obsessed roommate for two years who had me try all sorts of brands and lectured me about all the nuances in tobacco. In one ear and out the other (though I'm sure I still have some in my lungs).

Maison Edwards is pretty awesome even for the quitter. Super old-timey and cozy. A place to smoke a pipe and stroke your mustache. There are almost always people sitting in the two seats inside just smoking away. Whiling away the hours of the day. I wouldn't mind having that ritual. 

The lady behind the counter is also almost always smoking cigarettes. Good to know she knows her merch. And she does. They have a huge selection of loose rolling tobacco and you tell her what you're looking for, she'll find it. They also have a nice selection of lighters (from bics to really really nice $200 classy-as-hell fire givers). 

Even though I have experience with tobacco the overall air of the place is obscured by a veil of untouchable expertise. Clerks aren't snobby here, don't get me wrong. But the social ambience is kind of intimidating. Partly because there is a kind of exuded l'ennui (more like the seasoned boredom kind than the woe-is-me kind).

Ready for the nit-picking? For a specialty store, I kind of want to see some seriously rare imported cigarettes. Like I want to see my Mexican Ovalados (er, I'm missing a letter or two there) or some Russian harsh-cancer-in-a-stick. I know importing, especially cigarettes and alcohol, is absolutely nuts. And maybe the laws are in part to blame. But I want to be wowed.

For loose rolling tobacco this place can't be beat. For earthy and old-timey ambience, this place can't be beat. Service could be a little more welcoming and selection could be more exotic.
