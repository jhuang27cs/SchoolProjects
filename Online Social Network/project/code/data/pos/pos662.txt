This place is just INCREDIBLE. The amount of choices they offer will allow you to eat there 10 times and still never get to try everything they have. My boyfriend and I had the lamb dish and sampled  of their side dishes. The complexity of flavors in every dish is outstanding, and everything is cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly.And sometimes it's the little things that stand out- like the pomegranate sweetened tea or the rose water unsweetened tea. WOW. Do yourself a favor and stop in- it'll become your favorite local spot.
