I have never written a review before, for any restaurant, but decided to after our experience last night. We have been going to The Clay Pit pretty regularly for the last couple of years. The food is always wonderful. The other consistent thing we could always count on was the service, or lack there of. For some reason, we never get good table service when we dine there. That is, until last night. Derek, our waiter was exceptional. It was with a doubt one of the best experiences we have ever had. He was beyond attentive, timely, and charming.
