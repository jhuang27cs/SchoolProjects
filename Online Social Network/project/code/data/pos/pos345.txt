Total fan of this place.  The price is reasonable, the food is delicious and innovative, and make sure to grab a glass of the cucumber water. Get over the fact that it's small and you're not getting the fine dining experience of Real Food Daily. The food here is easily comparable, the workers are all cool, and you're definitely full after you eat.  I dig it.

My favorite things to get:

Native Nachos
Oklahoma Burger (Bacon and Cheese)
