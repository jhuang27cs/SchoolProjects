Ok this place is cool. Like you can get a cappuccino and then run to the train. Very similar to the location on university ave, but a little more convenient for most. And there is a perk, I noticed on the receipt given from the main location on university that you can get a free espresso or cappuccino just by showing your receipt from the other location. Pretty chill and economical since this place is a little $$ overall. 

I have the croissants here usually and they pretty good and flaky.
