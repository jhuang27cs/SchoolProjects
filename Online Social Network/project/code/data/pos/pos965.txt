Even if you don't like donuts, you have to try Stan's. These donuts rate as some of the best I have ever had anywhere in the world. 

This little place is squeezed into a corner of Westwood, across the street from the old theaters. I don't know how they churn out so many donuts from that tiny little space, or even how they sell them all. But damn they are good. Old-fashioned are my favorites. And sometimes you can even get an old-fashioned with maple frosting. Sigh. A little bit of heaven.

I actually met Stan once in the shop. He's for real!
