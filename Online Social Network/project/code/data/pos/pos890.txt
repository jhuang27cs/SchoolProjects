i guess the gods must be financially well off if they can afford eating here on a regular basis (note: if any of you gods up there have any extra cash to spare, please send some way, i promise i'll believe in you and won't doubt your existence anymore)

i can't really complain about prices, though; my BFF Zeus treated me here for lunch one day.  Helios was supposed to join us but didn't have much of an appetite after being hungover.  it was nice sitting outside on the balcony and eating our sandwiches, and sharing our fries while gossiping about how Apollo caught Calypso in bed with Aphrodite the week before.  that floozy!

I can't really comment much on the food since i'm not a god myself, i'll defer my judgement over to Zeus, if I could ever convince him to join yelp.
