I love the Botanical Gardens. They are probably one of the only places where you can go and feel like you live in a city that has plants and greenery. The turtles that wander throughout are all non-native -- they were previous pets that people chose to release in the little river that runs through the gardens, and the tiny waterfall in the corner of the Gardens is ideal for pictures. 

If you walk far enough into the gardens, you'll find a bench that is conveniently located on a little slope/hill thing. It's really good for thinking, and overlooks quite a few historic trees and plants. It's hard to get mad at nature, but it's really easy to think about a lot of things when there aren't that many people around you. The gardens are rarely crowded, if ever at all. 

The only downfall is that they close early.
