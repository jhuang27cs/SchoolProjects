The epitome of a lovely place to spend a Friday night. I came here on a whim  for my friend's birthday. I ordered a dark and stormy, and my friend ordered the caliente margarita. What tasty cocktails! I went home wondering where they had been all my life. We dinned in their outdoor area, which is right on the sidewalk in Central Square. The food was a bit expensive for what it was, and it didn't produce quite as rhapsodical a reaction as the cocktails did. Still, I've spent subsequent weekends trying to reproduce the the experience of springtime open-air dinning with a perfect dark and stormy. So far, nothing in my neighborhood, Allston-Brighton, has been quite as magical.
