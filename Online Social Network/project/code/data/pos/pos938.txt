WOW. I am rendered speechless--nay, almost wordless!--by CoHo's relatively recent (ok, I'm a little behind on the times) revamp. Let me tell you, CoHo was flying high my sophomore year (2003-2004). The menu at the time featured the incomparable Baja Chicken Caesar wrap. Imagine my horror when the BCC was replaced with an army of unfortunate-tasting crepes. I shudder to think. Long story short, boycott ensued, and I hadn't been back for food since, until today. Imagine my joy, my rapture, my utter ecstasy at finding a well-curated selection of panini. I ordered the portobello panini, and it was a mushroom-based slice of heaven. Mozzarella cheese, basil, toasted to perfection. In fact, it was reminiscent of Coupa's version, but--dare I say--better. Like Coupa, however, it came with a side salad of fancy greens. Can't those of us who only eat iceberg and romaine lettuce get a little love? I definitively declare--CoHo is once again THE place to eat on campus. Now if only they could bring back the BCC...
