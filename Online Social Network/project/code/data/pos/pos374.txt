Granted I don't know any other tattoo places in the nearby area, this place is the best by default.  The place is huge and downstairs is the piercing area.  My friend and I made our way up the stairs to the tattoo parlor/section. We perused the magazines and various pictures of tattoos, but had already decided what we were getting.

I wanted two stars on my wrists originally smaller than the size of a dime, but the tattoo artist said the smallest they go is about dollar coin size.  I got on both wrists, and ended up paying the base price of $80.

The place is very clean-looking and sterile.  Whenever I see tattoo parlors in movies, it's always in the dingiest/sketchiest places.  Luckily, Stiehl's was nothing like that.  Everything is wrapped in sterile packaging until needed. The tentative drawing of my tattoo was placed on my arm to use as a guideline for the artist. He shaved the area (standard practice, even though I don't have a hairy wrist or anything) and got going.  It was less painful than I was expecting, except when it got sort of closer to my hands, upper wrist.  Other than that, the experience was pretty pleasant. My tattoo had some crackly, un-inked parts along the border of the star after the initial two weeks or so of basic tattoo care, so my friend and I went back to get our tattoos touched up.  They offer up to 3 free visits of re-touching, which is really nice.

I would definitely recommend this place if you live in Ithaca.  Very friendly and helpful staff, and most important of all, sterile technique is practiced  here.
