I'm just doing this because rating Ikea is fun.

PROS
* Modern decor at reasonable prices.
* Hot dogs & Soft serve ice cream are yummy and cheap as hell.
* It's great for nerds who actually enjoy putting modular things together
* It's a one-stop shop if you're a lazy decorator and need basic things. I don't get why people say Ikea stuff won't look good in suburban homes. Just cause you live in the burbs dont mean you have to buy from Pier 1.
* Those dolly cart things are fun to ride on.

CONS
* Very crowded.
* Everyone and their gramma will own the same stuff you do.
* Terrible for people who have no patience and hate putting things together.
* It's very DYI. You see what you like, you find it in the warehouse, you ring yourself up, you haul it home. The staff will help out with stock questions but that's probably about it.

THINGS WORTH BUYING
* Desks. They have a variety of table tops and legs that you can mix & match.
* Storage units. Cute tin canisters and plastic container that are just as nice as the Container store but way cheaper.
* Textiles. They have nice modern prints and curtains that are affordable.
* Plants and pots. 
* Lighting.
* Rugs. We found a nice neutral-colored one with nice texture for $150. But not all of it is nice.
* Sheets, duvet sets. 
* All their kids stuff is cute
* Kitchen stuff. My friend redid her kitchen and got the cabinet units from Ikea. It looks fabulous.

THINGS NOT WORTH BUYING
* Couches, some chairs.
* Bookcases. If you have a lot of heavy books, the cases will sag.
* Mattresses. Not comfortable.
* Blankets, pillows. Overpriced. Go to Home Goods. Their decorative pillows however, are not bad.
* Art section. Sure generic furniture is ok but art is one thing you should be selective about.

TIPS
* A trip to Ikea is never an in an' out experience. Be prepared to walk, even if you just go to the market place floor and not the showrooms.
* It's more fun going with other people. You never know when you'll need someone else to help lift things. 
* In an effort to cut down on using paper/plastic bags, they will charge you 5 cents for bags. So either bring your own or be prepared to lug your shit in your hands. Again, having a friend is a good idea.
* Having a big car is recommended. Otherwise they have twine so you can strap things to the trunk or roof. Master Boy Scout knot-tying techniques.
* Go online, if you see things you like, check the stock at the Altanta store BEFORE you go. Sometimes I call the store to make sure.
* Check out their "as is" section near the checkout. It's mostly crap but once in a blue moon they do have bargains.
* Check Craigslist often, because people are always putting Ikea stuff on sale there.
