I went to this place for the first time with a amazon local deal and it was great! I think that i got a better massage here than at the last place that I went to for a regular massage.  It says that it is a foot massage place, but they work out practically the whole body.  Very relaxing and great on the tight muscles.  Loved it. Even though it is a bit out of my way, I will probably go again even without the voucher!
