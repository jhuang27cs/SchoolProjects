As a graduated UCLA student i have to say i miss this place very much, the staff didnt change in all my years of visiting.  
Always seemed to have a line out the door and for good reason. 2 perfectly baked cookies with a scoop of ice cream in between! HEAVEN! and for 1.50 used to be 1.00 i know TRAGIC, its still pretty damm good!! 

no place to sit, but somehow always managed a seat if i wanted one. great dessert place. worth the  hype, even with the price increases. long live diddy reese!
