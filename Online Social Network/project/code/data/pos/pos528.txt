This place was a great surprise! I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch. We ordered a few different items to fully experience the range of the menu. The pancakes are delicious. We had both the buttermilk and the buckwheat. I was very impressed with the buckwheat. Most places get this wrong, they typically end up tasting like cardboard but NOT these. They were light, fluffy and delicious. They offer 2,3,4,5 or 7 pancakes starting at $3.25...This is a great deal for light eaters. They offer two types of potatoes, roasted red potatoes with onion and peppers and good old hash brows, both delicious. They have some amazing looking pancakes with a wide variety of toppings like banana pancakes topped with caramelized bananas and chopped walnuts, cinnamon apples, chopped pecans and brown sugar butter, the "Tree Huggers" with granola, fresh fruit with sweet orange butter and the list goes on and on all at about $6.75 for a very large serving....You must try one of their daily specials as well. Today they had crepes stuffed with lemon creme topped with whipped cream!!!!! Yummy!!!  They also offer a build your own omelette and offer egg whites for those who enjoy the yolk-less omelette with all fresh ingredients to choose from starting at $5.25.The atmosphere is a modern decor twist with LA Icons adorned as wallpaper and the place sort of feels as if you are sitting in a MOCA vignette. The owner is a USC Architecture graduate and his talent is well displayed in this restaurant. The seating is very comfortable and definitely an important factor for the students who sit at most of these tables. Parking is available in the lot or on the street - just check the signs to avoid a ticket or worse getting towed. Jacks and Joe is a great choice for breakfast/brunch which is served all-day and at very reasonable prices for the quality! Enjoy!
