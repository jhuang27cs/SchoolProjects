I came here with my fiance and his family for my fiance's birthday and we had a good time.

The staff was genuinely nice and courteous.  We didn't have an appointment but we didn't get any death glares or stink faces from anyone, which was nice.

We were seated in less than 10 min.s and still received with excellent service.  My fiance's sister was concerned that there was no eggplant in her dish and the server reassured her that there was (it was just small) and even brought out an extra dish of eggplant at no charge.

The food was great.  Not to die for, but great.  Now their salad was so delicious, I'm craving it as I type.

The atmosphere was nice as well, they had interesting pictures everywhere which made for funny moments at our table.

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is curious about the restaurant.
