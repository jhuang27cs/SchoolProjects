Best tried so far in the Bay Area.Not cheap, but you get what you paid for.You`ll look pretty good to take your date out there.Nice location,modern,fairly new,plenty of parking (street + a lot across the street).Salad bar`s nice ,clean and inviting.I`d go back if really hungry for meat, since there are some pieces that you just can`t say no to....
Forget about prior to the dinner`s dreams that you`ll eat all their meat.After 4-5 pieces, you`re almost done, hence unless you`re really killing for a lot of meat,it`s kind`of waste of money at $44/head (Rodizio).
