I noticed last week that there was some water around the floor drain of my garage. I asked a friend of mine for plumber referral in our area, as I didn't know anyone reliable.

At the office, I promptly called the number my friend had given me, but it appeared that I must have misdialed, because it was a Doctor who answered the phone, so I apologized for the wrong number.

However, I was quite astonished because the Doctor didn't release, but instead asked what kind of plumbing or drainage problem I got at home, so I told him about the clogged floor drain in my garage, just to get the conversation over and done with.

When he asked what time would I want him at the house, I got really confused!

Thus, I respectfully inquired: "Excuse me, Doctor, but what business exactly do you have coming to my house?"

Slowly and distinctly he responded: "Sir, I'm not a Doctor, but our company is called "Drain Surgeon" and you've called us concerning your garage drain problem. Usually, a drain problem like this can't be fixed through the phone, so we really have to come over to your house."

"Ummm..., in that case, let's arranged for Saturday morning at 10:00 AM", I conceded.
 
When the guy first answered, I really thought he said "Brain Surgeon"!

And the only reason why I was hesitant to have an appointment, was essentially because there's absolutely nothing wrong with my brain at all.

Damn it! It appears that California is replete with funny and pun-oriented business names, which I didn't quite appreciate.

They shouldn't mix legitimate business with comedy business.

Anyway, the Drain Surgeon guy who came over was an experienced plumbing professional, respectful and with a friendly attitude, who provided satisfactory service. The guy also gave me their contact number in Glendale: Tel. 818-843-5853

Accordingly, if you have a need for drain surgery, the Drain Surgeon could perform the operation readily, with utmost dedication and efficiency.
