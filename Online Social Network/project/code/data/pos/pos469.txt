We love their food!
My husband and I usually go here during the week when we're out running errands.  I love their salads.  You can get them small or large but typically the small is large enough for me (and I have a good appetite).  I also love their wraps. Sometimes it takes a few more minutes to eat there but that's because they make things to order, which means they are fresh.  My husband loves their sauce and get's a chicken parm sandwich a lot.  Sometimes we get their dinners and haven't been disappointed yet.  There pasta fazole (sp?) is the best I have ever had and they always have it.  I have never had their pizza but I know it is popular.  My husband and I love to go to non-chain restaurants where the owners are present and care about quality.  Best of all, the prices are great!!
