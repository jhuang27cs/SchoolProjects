The themes of interconnectedness, alienation, identity and intersecting lives seem to be particularly popular lately.  Or maybe personally more resonant or relevant as I seem to relate behind the seclusion of text / internet / e-mail more than anything else these days.  *Sigh.*  

"Sleepy" takes seemingly disparate stories to evoke or show these themes in dark, raw and most basic form.  Appropriately performed in dream-like ("nightmarish" from the website) sequence, I have to admit that I didn't "get" everything in this play.  What did resonate though was the searing intensity of emotion and feeling that we've all experienced at some point:  presuming that a relationship is copacetic and then having the till-then unquestioned smugness pulled out from under you as you fall smack down on your just as shocked ass; or, alternatively, quietly suffocating and seething in a relationship in which your partner knows nothing about you and doesn't even want to know until you. just. can't. deal.  And explode in a fit of frustration and, relief.  Or finding comfort in and trusting someone you shouldn't and never being able to shed the self-blame.  That taking on a life of its own in your never-ending quest to "get it right."  This time.  Or harboring a poignant unrequited (yes, redundant) crush on someone and ineffectually only being able to tell her when she's sufficiently tuned out.

Explosive, bare-bones vignettes in an appropriately bare-bones, underground theatre, "Sleepy" may come off as undone flashes.  But as far as emotional and experiential vindication goes, cheers for reminding us of the universality and community of catharsis.
