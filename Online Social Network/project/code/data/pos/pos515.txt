My friend and I came here once, not realizing it was in a cafeteria-like setting in the MIT Student Center rather than a sit-down restaurant, but we were pleasantly satisfied. We both had falafels and they were absolutely delicious. They are also made with vegetables so they have more nutrients, and have a nice green color.

Our server was also the owner. He really cares about the food, and loves to talk about it too, but he was really nice and offered us many samples. He said they used to be exclusively vegetarian but he eventually started serving meat as well.

Definitely delicious, I plan on going again soon.
