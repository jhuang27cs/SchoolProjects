Any bratwurst/bockburst combination with whatever condiments you desire is a win. I do prefer the Top Dog on south side though, but simply because it has a bit more character. 

Tip: Don't get the chili and cheese, no matter how tempting it sounds. The cheese is not melted and the chili is... beany. 

Bon app√©tit!
