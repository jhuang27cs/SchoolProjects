I've been a fairly serious cyclist for 15 years or so and I've never encountered a friendlier owner or staff. Charlie the owner will never sell you stuff you don't need and his prices are always fair. I bought my second bike from him (the previous one was 2 bikes and many years ago) last year and I am very happy to call this shop my cycling home again. Got a very nice deal and was able to get the bike tailored to the terrain I ride in with no hassle. Plus-what's not to love about Bianchi bikes.
