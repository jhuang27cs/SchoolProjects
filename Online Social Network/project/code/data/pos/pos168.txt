The Press is a quant and delightful restaurant located 20 feet past a bar filled with Claremont College potential hypsters and what passes for Inland Empire Trust Fund Babies. Once you are past the bar you enter the Press. It's fair food, a mixture of organic, fresh made and few take home leftovers due to the abundance of classic comfort foods with a hearty twist.

Just remember it's just past the douche bags at the bar.
