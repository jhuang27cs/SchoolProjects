Overpriced on a regular basis, but they've got some good deals after 7:30(ish) on weekdays. And their stuff is always fresh, which is far more than can be said at pretty much all the other supermarkets around the neighborhood. They also have some of the most random obscure things that you will not find in any of the other supermarkets.

Margot G. and I were at the gym earlier this evening and decided to stop by Garden of Eden for salad stuff. I had a huge craving for Twizzlers earlier on the bus, so I grabbed those at DR before heading into Garden of Eden. I spotted the sushi bar about 10 feet from the entrance after walking in, and what's this? $2 off any sushi pack after 7 pm? Yes please! For $4.95 I received a fresh pack of 8 California rolls. A gigantic Caesar's salad and package of grapes later, and we were sitting at $16. Like I said, some things are a good deal and some things are not.

So, sushi and Twizzlers in hand (post-gym dinner of champions?), we headed home and I must say the sushi was some of the best that I've had in the area. Far superior to Suma Sushi in the same neighborhood. It was fresh and did not taste like it had been sitting in the cooler all day. I'm a fan. Now whenever I have a post-gym craving for sushi, I know where to go! I'll just remember to keep my purchases limited in here since it racks up quickly!
