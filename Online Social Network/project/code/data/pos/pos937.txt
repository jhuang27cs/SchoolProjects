I've been working in Pasadena at Caltech since 1995 and have been living in Pasadena since 2005. Since that time I have enjoyed going to Amigo's especially since moving here in 2005. When I want good mexican food and a good time all I have to do is walk two blocks up to Amigo's. Besides the food I like that it's a magnet for locals that live in the area as well as Caltech people. If your in the bar not only dose the conversations include sports it could also include science.

On Sunday (9/12/2010) I walked back from Old Town Pasadena and was hungry so I walked in and ordered one of my favorite dishes, the #21 Super Burrito. Most mexican restaurants, when you order a burrito, you get just the burrito and that's it but at Amigo's one gets a plate with rice, beans and the burrito of their choice. The Super Burrito will set you back $7.50. Not too bad for the amount of food you get and by the way I rolled home with a full stomach.

Other items I enjoy:
#19 Carne Asada Burrito
#20 Colorado Burrito (Refried beans, seasoned beef, diced tomato, shredded lettuce & cheese all wrapped in a soft flour tortilla & covered with a red enchilada sauce)
#17 Fajitas (Both steak & chicken)
#1 Amigo's Nachos with steak
#57 Machaca (Shredded beef saut√©ed onions, bell peppers, tomatoes and egg) I always add jalapenos to kick it up a notch.
#55 Carne Asada Dinner Plate

Writing this has made me hungry see you at Amigo's!!!
