YUMMY. The idea of cookies between ice cream is GENIUS. Perfect for the hot day, but prepared to make a little mess. ;)

I had the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies with strawberry ice cream and it was OMGSOGOODILOVESTRAWBERRY amazing! The two just compliments each other! The double chocolate chip with mint chocolate ice cream was pretty good, but I have to say my favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut with strawberry ice cream.

If you get lucky, you can get the cookies that come fresh out of the oven, which makes it even BETTER!
