I don't often bother to review restaurants that already have many reviews, but we had a such a nice dinner there tonight that it merits a positive review.  We have eaten at Buona Tavola a number of times over the last 13 years we have lived in SLO, and it has been consistently good.  I would say the food and service this evening were as good as we have experienced in SLO.  The location of the restaurant (right next to the Fremont Theater) and the intimate interior space of the restaurant make for a wonderful atmosphere.  In warm weather, we love the back patio, but on this rainy evening we enjoyed the view of Monterey Street from the huge picture windows in the front of the restaurant.  As vegans (most of the time), we were pleased with the number of vegetarian choices offered on the menu.  Rita had the price fixed special with wine pairings, and was able to order a vegetarian dish for each of her three courses (a lentil soup, an eggplant pasta dish, and a mushroom risotto, all excellent).  I had the penne all'arrabbiata, also excellent.  The dishes may look small, but we found them quite filling.  Wonderful desserts  as well -- I had the Tartufo Italiano Al Cioccolato (chocolate gelato with hazelnuts and espresso -- not vegan, I know), and Rita had a special dessert, a lemon torte.  This probably is the best "date" restaurant in SLO.  A little pricey, but a friendly, warm place that did not leave me feeling ripped off.
