I'm shocked to see all the negative reviews for this place. When my parents are in town, this is THE spot we hit up for some authentic chinese food. Beware, do not ever order from their normal american menu. They have a special menu in chinese with their real specialties. 

The food is soooo good and reminds me of home cooking with more emphasis on taiwanese style than i'm used to, but still delicious! My favorites are their "sha guo", sorta like hot pot style, but its all ready for you to eat. Sushi here is decent and cheap, but i wouldnt make a meal of just sushi. Drinks priced reasonably, and you can even order a glass of champagne!

For college park, this place definitely makes my top 3
