The only real flaw to Chewy's is that its burgers are of the small slider variety. But they make up for the small size by being extra big on flavor. And now that they added fried chicken and waffles into the mix I might just be sold for the long run!

Whether you go for beef, turkey, or veggie patties its fresh toppings provide you with some admirable possibilities. The blue cheese burger is loaded with mushrooms and carmelized onions. pico de gallo, cheddar cheese, and a chipotle sauce sit upon the Diablo burger. The Kimchi Burger spices things up with cabbage and red pepper paste. And the Toga cools things down with tapenade, feta cheese, and yogurt sauce.

Chewy's also offers impressive extras like tater tots (and buffalo tots with crumbled bacon), delicious fries, and fresh made waffles. And they even deliver some big hot dog and breakfast sandwich options!
