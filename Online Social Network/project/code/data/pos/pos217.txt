Best haircut of my life!!! 

I initially walked into this salon because I had received a coupon from them.  The Salon was very clean and the people who worked there were very nice. As soon as I entered the receptionist asked if I would like something to drink. 

They set me up with Keri for a haircut. At first I was super nervous because I have yet to walk away from a haircut with a good feeling. I am very happy to say that Keri gave me the best hair cut ever! She made sure that I was 100% happy with the end result - and I was.  

She listened to what I wanted - and executed it perfectly. One thing that really stood out to me is that normally when I tell a stylist that I feel like my hair is flat on top they usually just recommend product for adding volume. She actually cut my hair in a way that I had never seen before to add instant volume. 

Although I no longer live in San Diego I will definitely make the trip just to go get my hair cut by her. 

Make sure to make your appointment well in advance because the last time I called she was booked for a whole month! Definitely worth the trip and the money :-)
