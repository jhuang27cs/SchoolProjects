I went here with my husband and sister who was visiting. The food was really good. All the courses were yummy. They were very accommodating to the fact that I was 39 weeks pregnant and had trouble fitting in the booth so they moved the the table more without even being asked. It was expensive but it served its purpose: great food at a expensive price is part of taking others out.
