Wow.

Like, WOW.

Who woulda thunk that in the middle of Houston (!!) there is amazing Thai food?  Coming from San Francisco, with the plethora of Thai, Asian, Asian-fusion places, I didn't expect much.  

But - WOW.

We had the eggplant basil and pad pet with tofu (e08).  Outstanding flavors - both were spicier than I expected (a nice surprise - glad it wasn't toned down for the local palate), and absolutely delicious.  The eggplant was very well done - tender, not greasy, nicely flavored, while the tofu had a bold, intense curry with complex flavors.

This place would easily hold its own on the culinary scene in San Francisco.  

WOW!
