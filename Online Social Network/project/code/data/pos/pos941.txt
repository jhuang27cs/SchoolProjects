The staff is extremely friendly.  They are very helpful when you ask questions about how to get to places, and in need of recommendations.  The rooms are a nice size, in good condition.  Called for extra pillows, and had them delivered in 15 minutes.  I like having the kitchenette, as bringing home doggie bags, I can reheat my food easily.  

The breakfast buffet changes slightly daily, which is nice.  The morning staff is very efficient.  The food good.  I ordered room service a few times, and the food came hot, and quickly.

The parking situation is not great.  You have to obtain a parking permit from the front desk.  If you come back later (around 10pm) good luck finding a parking spot.  However, they are located 1 block from the Metro (light rail).  It is great getting into downtown.  They also offer shuttle service to all the medical centers and the Galleria.
