Overall thought this place was really tasty.  I like Vietnamese food but have never had it in La Jolla... usually I have Vietnamese in Mira Mesa or on El Cajon blvd.  I was pleasantly surprised by this place! 

The portions were perfect.. not too large and not too small... just right.  The restaurant was also very clean which is always a plus.
