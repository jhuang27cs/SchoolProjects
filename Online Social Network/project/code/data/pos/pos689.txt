God bless you, Asian donut man.

When you smell fresh donuts sizzilin' in the fryer, it's game over. Don't even try. No one can resist! King Pin donuts are perfect for late night snacks or a sugar boost during finals. My favorite donuts are the maple bar/twist and glazed old-fashioned. I also enjoy sugar doughnut holes. Mmmm..... calories...

Tips: Go at night, when the donuts are fresh. Donuts are now trans-fat free!
