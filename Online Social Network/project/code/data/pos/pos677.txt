The Shakedown is an organic eatery completely run by the students at Pitzer College (and a few other student employees from the Claremont Colleges.)

Although the concept sounds great in theory, it has not shined in the past. Now as a junior, I have been to the shakedown 4 or 5 times in my college career. Each time I went, I hoped for something delicious, fresh, and unique. Each time I was, unfortunately, disappointed.

From guacamole made with unripe avocados, to dried-out samosas, to even finding a piece of plastic wrap in a burrito, I always wanted to love the shakedown, but couldn't for various issues. 

..until now. 

The Shakedown Cafe has finally realized its vision. In fact, I would now go as far to say that it provides some of the best cuisine in the Claremont area. 

For one, the menu is now very solid. Ranging from tacos to salads, the Shakedown has an excellent mix of well-prepared organic foods. The standout and highlight of this review, however, is the burger. 

The Shakedown Burger may be the best burger I've ever had. An amazing combination of quality beef and toppings, this thing is unbelievable. Tonight, I had a burger with greens, blue cheese, aioli, caramelized onions, and a fried egg. There are many more options on the menu, but this was awesome. Well-seasoned, great portion, right textures. Amazing. The price is right too...at $7.50, it's certainly not cheap, but its a fair price for the quality. I would even argue that the Shakedown burger is better than the famous Back Abbey burger in the Claremont Village. 

I've also tried the Ganache bomb...at $4.00, it's pricey for the portion, but rich and delicious. 

Whether you are a student at the Claremont Colleges or not, give the Shakedown a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
