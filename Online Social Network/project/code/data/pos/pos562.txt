Whenever there's a momentous occasion in my life, anniversary, graduation, or the like, I go to Pepper Sky. I love that place. The place is great which is kind of a double edged sword. It can get pretty full, but the wait is never too long. Service is okay, and the food is good. My personal favorite is the pad thai, you can never go wrong with the pad thai. Never. Actually, I know I need to try other things on the menu, I always sneak things of my friends plates and their delish! Next time I go there I'm going venture outside of comfort zone and get the green curry, well maybe, we'll see.

  It's decently priced for a nicer restaurant it's not too expensive. If you're in the neighborhood, you should definitely stop in.
