I love this place.  Pod was one of my favorite restaurants to go to in Philly and is a great place to take out of town friends.  The martinis are all very tasty and reasonably priced.  The sushi is a little expensive, but is extremely good.  I also really enjoyed the salads and soups here.  They have a conveyor belt sushi bar where you can sit and pick individual rolls as they move by.  

The vibe there is really great - they have rooms that light up in different colors and generally your table/chairs have lights in them as well.  There is usually Cowboy Bebop or something similar playing on the TV behind the sushi bar and they have great happy hour specials.

It sometimes gets overrun with Penn students, but if you call ahead and make a reservation you won't have to worry about waiting very long.  The only downside is parking nearby which can be difficult, particularly on the weekends.
