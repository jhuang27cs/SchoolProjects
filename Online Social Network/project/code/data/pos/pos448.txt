Strolled in here just to look at bikes and rode out on a 2011 vita! Staff was super helpful and explained each bike's specs to me. They had several options for shorter folks, which I appreciated, and they made sure the bike I picked was comfortable in terms of grip placement, height and handlebars. They were super knowledgeable without being condescending and answered all my questions. I'm coming here for all my bike needs :)
