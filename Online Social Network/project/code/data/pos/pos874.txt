So, this place has awesome ambience.  Came here for my two year anniversary and the service was really good.  We ordered the four course classic which included cheese, a salad, meat, and dessert.  Those who are not familiar with fondue, you dip bread into hot cheese, and you cook the meat yourself.  Out of everything, I recommend just getting the cheese fondue and the dessert fondue.  Our waiter was really cool too.  For dessert he gave us a concoction of his own imagination.  It was mixed with melted snickers, peanut butter, and a bunch of other heavenly ingredients.  Lastly, the restaurant was amazing and put flowers on our table that my girlfriend could take home.  What a night!
