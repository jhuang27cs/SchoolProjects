I've used this service for years.  The best parts are that it tends to be on time and that there are bike racks on the front of the buses.  Unfortunately the drivers must navigate roads filled with undergraduates on bicycles who think they are immortal.  I've seen some close calls, but the drivers get serious kudos for being able to drive in that environment all day.

The drivers tend to be helpful and friendly, though some of them don't speak excellent English.  There are a few routes I get a bit car-sick on, but that is due to the twisty roads and frequent stopping-accelerating.  

The routes change, especially if there is construction going on.  Make sure you check to see what is running during the summer and holidays.  I've waited for shuttles that weren't going to come for days before.
