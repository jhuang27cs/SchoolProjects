Slick online ordering system and generous loyalty discounts make me feel like I'm gaming the system just enough to keep coming back.

I think each of the gourmet pizzas (predefined toppings) that I've had has been well conceived.  I especially liked the Mexican beauty, which comes with black beans, jalapenos, salsa, and monterey jack. Whole wheat crust can be a nice touch, although it doesn't have quite the bite you want in a pizza.

The subs aren't really an achievement of composition, but they put enough good stuff in there to make it worth your while.

The salads have been a let-down for me so far.  I think the ratio of frills (like pine nuts) to roughage is out of whack - by what I thought should have been the end of my spinach pine nut salad, a substratum of pine nuts and cranberries remained.

Join the mailing list for extra coupons and discounts -- its definitely worth it, as the standard menu prices aren't all that great.
