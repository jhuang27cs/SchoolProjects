They're not the cheapest gas downtown but they have the best selection of "stuff".  You can generally find whatever oddball snack, etc that you want on their shelves and it isn't all bottom-of-the-barrel quality (they have a pretty diverse Pringles selection).  The place is clean and the staff is friendly.  No complaints.
