The four stars are more for the atmosphere than the food.  People rave about the fish tacos.  Stay away from them.  They're heavily breaded, the sauce is french dressing (I think, in any case it's something not good) and they're served with fries.  The burgers are fantastic.  I haven't tried the fancier items.
