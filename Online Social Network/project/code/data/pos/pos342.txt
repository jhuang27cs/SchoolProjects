Hands down the best tri tip sandwich ever!  I also had their onion rings which was amazing as well.

 The only thing I didn't like was their steak cobb salad, I only got it because I saw some girl next to me eat it and it looked good, but it didn't taste all that great. 

Note: Please be prepared to run a few miles, crunches, lunges and a session of insanity if you decide to eat here, it's dangerously good but dangerously fattening but well worth the sweat =)
