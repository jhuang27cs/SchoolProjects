I like the Lithonia location much better... It's much bigger and less congested!! The food is wonderful of course! I mean who doesn't like chicken & Waffles? the sides are good as well... And Glady's knight actually came to the restuarant while I was there and that just made my experience sooo much better!!!! :-) 

This place is great!
