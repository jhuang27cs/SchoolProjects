They aren't my favorite independent book store, but they are an independent book store. I have to keep telling myself that, every time I see people traipsing around with the Harvard Book Store logo on a sweatshop-made tote bag.  Or are there sewing machines in the back? Anyway. I really shouldn't write these reviews after I've been experimenting with hot toddy recipes. 

The store has a nice used & remainder section downstairs, and good events. They sell out early, though, so check out their calendar online. Actually, check out the whole website: they do online ordering, and if you're local you can get green delivery. Or just come in and pick it up. Plenty of options. Just like with hot toddies.
