Yes, Lucy is relatively expensive and doesn't seem as high-quality as Lululemon.  However, I still end up buying a lot more from Lucy because they actually have good sales, so if you can hold out and wait for a sale, then BINGO you have yourself a good deal.  

For example, for the next few days they're having a promotion for an extra 30% off all markdowns, so I was able to buy a running skirt/capri for $30 (original price $75) -- not too shabby.

The salespeople are friendly and good at offering suggestions about what to buy for what activity, sizing, the fit, etc., and they seem pretty knowledgeable whenever I have a question.

Also, if you order online, there are often free shipping and/or discount codes that you can find through Google... and if something doesn't fit, you can exchange/return it at the store.
