Seriously the pedicure there is better than sex and chocolate...and that's saying something!!!

I totally drifted to sleep in their ever so comfortable ergonomic type chairs ( you are pretty much laying down while getting a pedicure), with the help of an additional neck rest as well! Megan (I think I'm getting the name right) did an awesome job on my hooker pink painted toes. She scrubbed my feet so well I think I'm feeling new sensations down there! Seriously every inch of my nails are painted.. you know sometimes when you get home and check and there are little bare spots left on the edges.

The salon is spotless, and I barley even noticed the nail polish/acetone smell, which is every so common at most nail spots. They also have tons of polish to choose from: Essie, OPI, and even a vegan polish line! This is mostly an appointment based place to call before just walking in. And follow them on twitter as well for last minute deals, which sometimes are almost up to 50% off!! $28 for just the basic pedicure, I can't even imagine what their signature one is like! http://twitter.com/NouvelleNailSpa
