I am addicted to the spicy salmon sushi (not the spicy salmon maki) and it is the main reason I keep coming back to Ye's.  I really like all the raw fish items on the menu but am not really that impressed by all the deep fried tempura stuff.  In the KW area, this place (either Kitchener or Waterloo location) is THE place to go when you need your unlimited sushi fix!  After years of operation they still have issues with occasionally bringing out the wrong items or not bringing them out at all.  Also, they tend to grab plates from in front of you too often so that it becomes a nuisance.  Am eagerly waiting for the new Sports World Crossing location in Kitchener to open.
