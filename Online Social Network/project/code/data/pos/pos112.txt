This is one of my favorite places to go because it's good Chinese food, which is rare to find in the bay area! I graduated in May but if I remember correctly, #74 (crispy noodle with chicken/beef/shrimp) and #77 (creamy corn sauce with fish) are really good. Service is pretty good too, the guy's really nice. It's cash only though.

The dishes here are worth the money because they serve a huge portion. For example, if you spent $7 on a dish, you can eat it for lunch and save it for dinner. That's a whole days worth of meals! The reason I give it 4 stars is because it's a bit too salty/greasy at times..but that's the price you pay for eating out! ha..
