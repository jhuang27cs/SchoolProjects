I'm not sure what the big gripe about the drive-through is, YOU'RE IN WESTWOOD, IT'S CROWDED.  Get over it and just relax while you wait for your food.  If it's super-busy, they have people coming out to the line to get your order.  I usually don't go inside because I'm on my way somewhere else.  In-N-Out is classic, no matter where it is.
