I've been here for dinner and lunch but, best of all, I listened to a friend describe the Thanksgiving dinner he and his wife had.  Like many of the reviewers, my friend raved about how this restaurant could make "ordinary food" taste sooo goooodddd.  Each time I came, I spent a long time reading the menu in an attempt to narrow down my choices and each time, I chose correctly.  In terms of atmosphere, the place is an oxymoron: sophisticated country.  Perhaps, it's a Napa Valley restaurant that got lost on the wrong coast!
