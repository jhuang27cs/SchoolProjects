It's a liquor store. It will always get 5 stars in my book. 

Outside of that fact, this Spec's - although small - does offer quite a good selection. Instead of attempting to fight the crowds at the Smith St. location, I came here after work yesterday to pick out some bottles of wine for Thanksgiving. 

Now, I'm no wine snob but I do have my preferences and enjoy trying new wines. The best thing about Spec's is they have probably one of the most extensive wine selections you will find in any liquor store. Even in this small one! Spec's is great too because they give little cards on different brands to clue you in to the flavors/berries used in certain wines. Most of the staff is well versed in what they sell and therefore serve as a great resource to shoppers such as myself. 

The staff at this location have always been pretty helpful, even when I'm just stopping in to pick up some beer and Michelada mix! I left out the door with 3 very different wines from Chile, South Africa and Australia...all for under $30! (FYI: 5% discount for paying with cash/debit)
