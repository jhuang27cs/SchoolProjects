I've been here both as a patron and a performer, and every time I've been taken good care of. Always very high quality performances, and the food.... mmmm! Your entree is included in the ticket price, but I urge you to get "Out Staff's Favorite Fries" as an appetizer. They're incredible! Honestly, I think about them more than I should...
