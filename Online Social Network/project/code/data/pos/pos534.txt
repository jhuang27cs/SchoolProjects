The absolute tops for bars I visited in Ithaca! Friendly atmosphere;  fun, edgy bartenders;  home-grown brews and liquors;  live music on Friday;  a sassy kept boy who showed me his ass but insisted he wasn't flirting with me.

Felicia's is a little quieter on Saturdays, but still worth a stop and chat/flirt with the bartenders, and the folks who are there with others will gladly strike up a short (or long!), pleasant conversation.

When you go here, don't stick with your regular libation.  Some crazy lesbian has dreamed up stuff that will blow your socks off, so try one of their specialty cocktails, or you will, I promise, regret it.  I had some crazy-good drink with homemade beet syrup.
