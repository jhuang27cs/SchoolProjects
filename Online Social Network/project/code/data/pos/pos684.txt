Whenever you eat on "The Ave" you have to keep in mind that the none of the restaurants are going to be really fancy, clean, and spacious. When you're a broke college student, typically you look for cheap food. So the fancier a place, the more expensive it'll be. This is why I don't mind places like Burger Hut and you should never have high expectations when eating on the Ave. I love their Burger Special that has an egg included (sounds weird but it's tasty!!!) and I get a side of onion rings that are really crispy. I hate soggy fries and onion rings. The guys working there have always been friendly but if it's busy I just get my food to go since the place is pretty small. They only have 2 guys cooking so if there's a line it might take awhile. Haven't had their shakes yet but I've heard they're good. They also accept debit/credit cards which I didn't expect since alot of small restaurants don't usually accept them. So that's another plus.
