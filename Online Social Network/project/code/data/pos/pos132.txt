I went back because I was hungry in the basement of Evans and I wasn't in the mood for Top Dog. This time I around I knew what I was doing so ordering was a little easier. Also, after my first review, the owner e-mailed me and apologized about the staff issue. I did appreciate the gesture so that kind of gave them a bonus in my opinion too.

Still, a four is what they get because of their prices. It's pretty average for restaurants near campus and they are pretty generous with the food portions. However, it's not something you might want to stop by at more than twice every three weeks (maybe that's just the broke college student in me).
