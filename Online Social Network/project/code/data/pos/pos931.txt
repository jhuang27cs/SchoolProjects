the fondest memory I have with BML is that it has a nice grass are outside, on which I used to run barefoot to rehabilitate my injury.

For some reason, i can't focus on studying at BML compared to geisel. It must be due to the hardcore aura i feel from med students... god save them all (and i am atheist).
