Clover is absolutely fantastic!   As a vegan, you don't get much better than this for the convenience and the prices.  Staff is always super friendly, if not a little quirky, and I ADORE that you can draw pictures with the provided crayons and paper.  Always so much fun with friends (probably too much sometimes!)

My favorites are definitely the veganized BBQ seitan (with tahini - TRUST ME), and the chick pea fritter.  The dinner plates are also great!  Fries are incredible, and I love the ketchup and spicy chili sauce they offer!

The space is amazing, clean and open with white walls and plants everywhere -- you'd never know you were one block away from bustling Harvard Square.  Long story short: if you're in the area and want a slam dunk dinner for $5 or less, CLOVER is where it's at!
