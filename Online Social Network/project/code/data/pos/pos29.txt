I've stopped by a few times over the past 5 months, You'll certainly find quite a selection of Hot Dog and Burger options, you're bound to find something you'll like. 

I love the hawaiian bread twist to their dogs and burgers, love their tater tots, i'll be back for sure. 

Nice clean environment, great service, if you love hot dogs and burgers like me this is a must.
