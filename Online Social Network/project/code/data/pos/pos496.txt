love love LOVE this place! I was looking for somewhere to eat and found this place on yelp and was impressed by the great reviews :) I decided to check it out, and I am happy to say that I loved dinner yesterday so much that I have since then already recommended this place to 4 friends. When I walked in I was greeted by the friendly staff and then escorted to my seat. I immediately noticed how clean the restaurant was, and although the outside looks drab and unappealing- the inside felt very classy but casual. A nice change for a college student on a budget. The menu had plenty of options that would seem to suit anyone looking for a great meal- and the best part is that they are pretty cheap but great quality. Even the portion size was generous. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and I loved every bite. The flavor was phenomenal, and the texture was very pleasing. The vegetables were not under or over cooked, and the rice I ordered along side it as not mushy or not too dry. It was very nice. I have been to the other chinese places in Berkeley and after dining there- decided not to return. However this place is a gem! Please come and try Happy Valley, the food is great, the staff is friendly, the ambiance is refreshing, and the quality is superb. Definitely returning soon!
