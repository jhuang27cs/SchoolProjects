This is a nice Peets to go to for relaxation; I don't usually get much done here, however.  The outdoor seating is awesome because you can kick back and gaze at Mount Wilson while you sip your brew.  One of the highlights is definitely their employee "Brother Bear" who calls all his regulars "brother" or "sister" and converses with them as if they were old buddies.

As for their baristas, they are good.  Nothing spectacular like I've experienced up in Oakland (Temescal location on Telegraph Blvd) but they have never ruined my drink either.
