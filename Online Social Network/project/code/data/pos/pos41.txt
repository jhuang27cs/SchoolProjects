The Ave has been in dire need of a place like this. Whether you are a wing fan or not, this place has other options on their menu, but they have TVs everywhere. I think I counted something like over 30 TVs, plus a giant projector TV on one wall. There's always sports playing on them, so don't expect some reality TV garbage. There isn't a better place on the Ave to watch a game.

The wings are good. I can't say they are better than that other place that used to be on the Ave, but they are probably on par. I loved that place, so it's definitely a compliment. I think they have 15-20 different sauces you can choose from. I prefer my wings spicy so I always go with the hottest sauce they have. For the daring, they have what they call the "Hell Wing" that I can personally verify, it's f*cking hot.

They have all kinds of drink specials going on all the time. It seems like everytime I go in they have another drink special. It definitely appeals more to the college crowd or guy crowd. 

The service has always been friendly and attentive.

For the true beer drinkers, they have a Beer 101 club. It's basically finish the 101 different bottled beers they have and you become a member of the club. Definitely a college thing. Oh well, sh*t I joined and I'm out of college. Hmmm...
