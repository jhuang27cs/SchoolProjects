In the midst of a Sunday morning long run, here is where I love Manhattan. Here is where I escape the urban jungle.

Sunlight bursting through the leaves, I pass under the tree-lined canvas of fiery oranges and yellows and reds. I tread October leaves beneath my turning feet as I gaze across the water.

Withering flowers along the path drop their final petals - to bloom again when the new leaf turns. I am reminded of the golden May afternoon when we came to where our favorite penpals finally met.

In the dusky shadow of a solemn memorial, we once sat and watched the children play in the twilight. And as I head toward the bridge, I look up to see the weathered crest of the last hill we climbed.

Memories stir like so many fallen leaves as I fly northward. We rarely experience days like this on our ordinary concrete paths.
