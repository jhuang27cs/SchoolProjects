I agree with other yelpers in that this place isn't as good of quality as Four Lear or Ten Ren, but still definitely has good boba and Taiwanese snacks/food. The manager is a sweet Taiwanese lady that always hooks it up. She makes the drinks the best and will customize it any way you like (amount of sugar, syrup, ice, pudding, jellies.. ask and you shall receive, just like they do in Taiwan!!). The food isn't of restaurant quality, but I have a soft spot for Taiwanese snacks and they have a good variety.. popcorn chicken, tea eggs, minced pork with rice..  yum yum yum. 

The cafe could be brightened up a bit, but it seems like they're not trying too hard to make this a real study spot/student hang out. A lot of the asians on campus come here, so it may be even loud at times if you do come here to try to study. There also isn't many outlets. Come for a drink and snack, but not if you're trying to hang out for long.
