I  think this place is a hoot!  I picture the old Harvard guys going out Teddy Roosevelt style and bagging all of these exotic animals and somehow getting them back to Oxford St.  The shabbiness of the animals, old glass and wood cases and overall atmosphere add to it's charm.  I thought my young nephew would love it, but think it may be too low tech for many kids.
