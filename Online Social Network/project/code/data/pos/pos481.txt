I love this place. I've been going there since I first discovered it a couple years ago and have been getting the same sandwich order since then, the chicken salad on cranberry walnut bread.  The food and fruit is always fresh and the pastries rotate seasonally.  Really chill atmosphere and a great place to sit down and grab lunch in Pasadena, that is if you can find a seat.  All in all, its one of my favorite places in pdena.
