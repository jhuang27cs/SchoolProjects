Who said learning can't be fun?

I remember going to this place a few years back and was excited to see this place again. Unfortunately a number of the exhibits are broken so that's a bummer (either lights don't work or the exhibit doesn't turn on). However, this place is still great and the new exhibit 1001 inventions from the Muslim World gives great insight into the pivotal inventions made during the golden ages of the Middle East. 

Entrance is free but it cost $10 to park inside the place. Weekends aren't too bad just don't go on the weekdays when the school field trips are taking place. Overall, even though the exhibits need retouching, it is still a great place filled with nostalgia. Also once you're done you can swing by the Natural History Museum or just chill at the Rose Garden.
