I am not a big Whole Foods shopper, especially at this location because the prices at this location tend to be higher than their other locations just a few miles away. I am a huge fan of their hot food section though. When I was going to school/working at UCLA, I enjoyed coming here to grab dinner. The prices were good (as far as Whole Foods is concerned), and you got a quality product for your money. There is even a decent outdoor seating area at the edge of the parking lot if you want to eat there.
