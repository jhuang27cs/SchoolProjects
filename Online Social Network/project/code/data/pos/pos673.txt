Been to Salts a couple of times and never been disappointed.
It's a fairly small location (just opposite to Craigie on Main) and makes for an intimate atmosphere. A little dark but comfy and quiet.
The food is always great and if you're planning to visit with 2 or more I highly recommend the duck for 2 (or more) , you just have to order it in advance.
Their tasting menu is very reasonable priced and a great choice.
I am not the biggest dessert fan but their dessert are great too.
The wait staff is very friendly and always willing to help/make suggestions.
Probably not the best place for a large group (6 or larger) but for small/medium a great spot.
