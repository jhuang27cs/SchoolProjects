I was very impressed by the service that I received at this store. I normally have a horrible time with any customer service rep regarding cell phone issues.. but Sean did an amazing job! 

When you walk in, make sure you sign-in at the kiosk right by the door. Then they will call your name when they are ready. I waited about 10 min, which wasn't bad at all.

I had to get a new cell phone and wanted an early upgrade. Sean was very knowledgeable about all the new phones out there, was able to show me the phones and tell me about the differences.. tried to find a phone that fit my needs and budget. He was very understanding and accomodating.

He also recommended some very useful accessories and told me which ones I could get a discount on... and I also got a rebate for my new phone!

He also gave me useful advice about my phone, my account, and how I could save more money. I was very surprised and thankful. He even spent the time to put the screen cover on my phone and uploaded all my contacts from my old phone. He stayed an extra 30 min after closing time to finish my transaction without even rushing me. Thank you so much!
