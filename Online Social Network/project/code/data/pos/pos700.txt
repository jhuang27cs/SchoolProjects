I am very pleased to say that this 'little' place has THE best nachos Ive ever had. I couldnt even eat them all. They were called "Gringo nachos" lol..I guess because when they add the meat, it changes the way its done in Mexico. I had mine with chicken, OMG, it was very moist, very nice big pieces of meat. The dish was very large and had a good richness....you will not leave hungry. My son and my boyfriend each had a super burrito, carne asada and chile verde. They are picky about their super buritos and were delighted to say that this place is a thumbs up! we will go back. The salsa is good, its hot. It does sit on the tables. I dont think they should keep that type of salsa the way its served on the tables? hmmm. Its a fresca style salsa with a kick. The place is small but great, the waiter we had was very nice and didnt leave us waiting even though it was packed.
