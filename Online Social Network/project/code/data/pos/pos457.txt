THE BIGGEST FRICKING CALZONE!  I posted a picture for reference.  This calzone is more like a family-sized chicken pot pie. 

In some ways, it is almost too big.  I know the disappointment of not finishing is countered by the jubilation of left-overs for lunch the next day.  However, this foot-ball sized Italian beast is so huge, that the crust to filling ratio is a little off.  I love cheese, but it's tough for me to eat a pound or two of it without plenty of bread.

Otherwise, the calzone is very tasty.  The crust is AWESOME.  Crispy, crunchy, soft, and flavorful.

I think one of things I like most about the Cellar is the seating in the basement/"Cellar."  It reminds me of an English pub with the plaster walls and dark lighting.
