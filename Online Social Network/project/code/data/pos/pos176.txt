We go for the atmosphere prices and to support the local economy. One of the things you should definitely do if you're in the Troy area on a Saturday. We go there every now and then, but not regularly, but the food is okay, actually good ! Love the free samples they're always good.!!
Support the farmers market they have a good thing going.!!!
