Jasmine Sola was overrated anyway. Meet Monella, its replacement in Harvard Square. Hats off to these guys for making use of their space and actually stocking it with clothes. Four stars for what they are: a reseller of moderately priced designer apparel. 

I was impressed to see some decent brands like Velvet and James Perse, and found the balance of solid separates to fluffy-collared dresses to be about right. The selection looks hit or miss but I can see myself walking away from this place with some good pieces every now and then. 

The no returns thing sealed the deal on my new black cardigan sweater dress thing: looks like we're stuck with each other! Meh.
