it was my first visit to this venue and I had a great time celebrating my friend's birthday!!  the environment changes from a chill and laid back setting to an upbeat and lively place!!  all depending on the music and the crowd of course.  but they have a fully stocked bar, the appetizers were a delight and affordable, and the customer service was outstanding!!  ask for Desiree!!  she took well care of our party despite how busy it got!!  keep the great work love!!  I recommend this place regardless of the occasion, as long as you're looking to have a good time.. this is a fun spot!!  :D
