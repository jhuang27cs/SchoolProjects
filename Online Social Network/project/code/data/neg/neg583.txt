This place is pricey. They list the price by rooms. There were 5 of us, and we had to pay for a 6 people maximum room since the smaller room was for 4 people. It was $42/hour. I didn't see rates listed for after you go over the hour, they would probably just charge you another $42/hour which is ridiculous. The song selection is outdated. The printed lists that are alphabetical are old, but they have newer sheets with a mixture of new songs that were hard to sort through. 

The only bonus would be...the tambourines included in the room.
