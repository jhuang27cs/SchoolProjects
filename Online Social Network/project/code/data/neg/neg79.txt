I do have a sweet tooth, but I am always skeptical of ice cream's healthier and often not-as-tasty cousin frozen yogurt. I hoped this place would prove me wrong. Sadly it didn't. 
 
They were HOPPING when my friend and I went around 7:30 on Tuesday. You serve yourself and then it is weighed. Some of their flavors include pink grapefruit and peanut butter.  But they have a ton of toppings which was truly the best part of the experience. The girl at the cash register was super nice, but after spending  over six bucks for this frozen "treat", I was underwhelmed. It was just "eh". 

The place will do well being in walking distance for local college kids and young hipsters...but I will not be going back. Bring on the ice cream, that is the real deal, folks...my heart and vote go with ice cream...Froyoworld proved to me yet again that frozen yogurt just doesn't stack up.
