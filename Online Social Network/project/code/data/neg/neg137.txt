It's truly amazing to me that this place considers itself a high-end salon.  I left that place looking like one of the following: 1) it was 1985, with my feathered, chunky-layered uneven mullet (any "high-end" stylist should know that even if I had asked for it, curly hair does not do well like that) ; 2) that I was a blue/gray-haired, bridge-playing 85 year-old granny; or 3) that a prepubescent aspiring hair stylist hacked into my hair on a whim at a junior high sleepover.  I asked the stylist to "fix" what I thought was a bad cut from another stylist there 6 weeks earlier (I chalked that one up to lack of experience, both in cutting and in life), and left with the worst cut I have EVER had.

Also, having had my roots retouched several times here successfully, this stylist totally changed the color of my hair.  Even I, who is NOT a stylist, knows that you don't leave color on the entire head for a half hour, same as the roots, when all you want are the roots done (should've done a pull-through at the sink for 3 minutes only!!).   It's now several shades darker than the color I actually wanted. I will never, ever go back to this place.  It seriously needs to take itself down a notch on thinking it's a "high-end" salon.  Could've gone to Supercuts for the same Supercrappy style I now have to wait to grow out. Sigh.
