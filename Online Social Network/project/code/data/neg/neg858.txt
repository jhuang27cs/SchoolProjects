Architectural critique time...   this building is 4 stars compared to most of the new builds in Boston but zero stars compared to:
a) buildings Gehry has done before
b) buildings that have cost such a ridiculous amount
So it gets two stars.

What shocks me is that the combination of huge amounts of money, Frank Gehry and (the usually stellar) MIT came up with such a relatively bland and uninspiring building both inside and outside - especially the paint job. This is almost certainly Gehry's career low - especially after Bilbao's Guggenheim and LA's Disney Hall. It feels utilitarian - inside and outside - and it strikes me as a weak compromise - probably by MIT of all people.

Want to see a great MIT building - go to Simmons Hall.
Want to see a better Gehry building - go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry and tell me the Stata isn't the weakest of the lot.
