I think it would be easier and faster to make my own paper at home rather than to purchase it here at this Office Depot. I was going to say that the employees at this location were clearly retarded, but then I remembered that it was no longer politically correct to use the term retarded in that way... so I consulted my handy dandy thesaurus. 

Please feel free to use any of the following terms to describe (in a politically correct manner) the staff at Office Depot:

Backward, birdbrained, defective, dim, dim-witted, dopey, dull, dumbbell, dumbo, dumdum, dummy, exceptional, feeble-minded, gorked, half-witted, held back, imbecile, lamebrained, mentally defective, moronic, numbskull, opaque, pinhead, retardo, sappy, simple, simple-minded, slow, slow-witted, stupid, subnormal, touched, underachieving, weak, yo-yo.
