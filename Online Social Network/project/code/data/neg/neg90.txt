I've been coming here for over ten years.  Lulu's is Lulu's and it will never change but fortunately their Fried Tofu (big plate), hot and sour soup, and crab rangoon have never changed, and neither has my love of very unhealthy fried food.

if you come here for dinner the service is terrible but you'll get your food eventually.

if you come here for lunch your food will come out very quick and extremely hot, and it may or may not arrive around the same time your dining companion's food arrives.

it's cheap.

it's greasy.

the spicy peanut noodle bowl is DELISH. So is the fried tofu, egg roll, hot and sour soup, crab rangoon, curry, and pad thai.
