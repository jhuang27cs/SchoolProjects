I'll give it two stars. One for the blueberry dessert stuff, and one for the price. Those are really the only two pros.
I thought the couple bitter reviewers below me were just being, well, bitter, but really, they weren't. This place (can I even call it a place?) really truly just has two piles of bland "vegetable mush." And don't get me wrong, I love Indian food and all the "vegetable mush" that goes with that. But I found both of the whopping 2 savory options at this place besides rice to be quite bland and unsatisfying. Bottom line, if you want a lot of unenjoyable food for cheap, this is your place,
