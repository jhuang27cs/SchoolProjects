I had a great experience here in October. Quick service, cheap prices.

I returned today, and I'll never go back. Prices on glass and foam core had doubled since October. The gentleman who served me (slowly ...) was more interested in quoting policy to me than serving me. In fact, he seemed annoyed by my requests and even went so far as to try to convince me to go elsewhere. 

I was a loyal customer - no longer!
