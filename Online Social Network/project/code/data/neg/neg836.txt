I generally like CPK but this one isn't anything special besides the location being convenient.  the drinks aren't at all great and a lot of times the pizza doesn't come out warm. the pizza is also a bit expensive. i would recommend a lot of the other good pizza places in westwood like enzos and lamonicas. it's good for groups though.
