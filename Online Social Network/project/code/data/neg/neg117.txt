I went with two other friends and we got a small supremes pizza, 10pc buffalo wings and a Spinach and Cheese calzone. Pizza was a decent size to share with everyone since we ordered other stuff. The wings were actually really good! But I was kinda disappointed how they only had bleu cheese dressing and no ranch. But when we cut the calzone into four pieces to share. I got my quarter on my plate and started to cut through to have my first bite. OMGOODESS. I couldn't cut through and looked at my calzone. They forgot to take out the entire plastic wrapping for the cheese and cooked the cheese wrapped in plastic in the calzone!!!!!!! Of course we immediately called the waitress over and she gave us a new one. Of course we didn't pay for the calzone and got 2 draft beer on the house (we paid for eveyrthing else).
I understand people can make mistakes and things can happen and Pizza Rustica was trying to make up everything for this.. but the more I think about this accident,,, this is a BIG deal. NO restaurant should make a mistake like this whatsoever!! Thank god the plastic was actually BIG beause I might've missed a small piece and eat it. 
If you decide to go to this place and order a calzone (but don't get the spinach and cheese calzone cuz they put in too much cheese that mushes out..not the oozing out stretchy cheese that you want in a calzone), make sure you be careful on what you order.
