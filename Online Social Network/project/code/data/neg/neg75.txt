I'm very disappointed by the customer service. I've been coming here for months because I thought the atmosphere was great and the hair stylists are really sweet. My son enjoys coming here. I make quite a drive to get here and shell out a good amount of money every month. The last time that we came in my son's hair around his face was too long and didn't get cut (this was a Sunday). I was going to bring him in the following weekend to just get the hair around his face trimmed so he didn't look like a girl. Unfortunately we couldn't make it in so the following week I called them and asked if it was ok that I came in this weekend. I know by this point it had been a while but I really didn't think it was that big of a deal to come back and have them trim the sides of his face. The girl that answered the phone was really rude and gave me such a hard time ("It's been 2 weeks! You needed to have come back within 1-2 days! It's not fair to the other stylists") Well, I am a working mom with 2 small kids that works until 6pm. Unfortunately I didn't have time. However I didn't have to get treated so poorly. They wouldn't work with me and they wouldn't trim those few pieces of hairs. So guess what? Not coming back again, I am finding another place closer to home where they appreciate my business and have better customer service.
