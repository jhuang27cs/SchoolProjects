I've been to Ike's three times. First time, I thought the sandwich (Spiffy Tiffy), was on the greasy side of alright, and perhaps a bit overpriced for the size. There was one person in line and it still took some 10-15 mins wait before the sandwich appeared. Second time, the line was insane and inching forward, because the service is so slow. So, I left. Third time, I decided to be clever and order using their iPhone app. Bad idea. They got my order completely wrong. Couldn't go back to complain because the place was closed (it closes at 6pm). To top it off, the sandwich didn't seem fresh at all, like it had been sitting outside for a while. The bread was soggy, having soaked all the dressing I had explicitly asked them not to use. I was starving, so I ate it. Terrible idea. Now I'm feeling sick. I'm never going back again.
