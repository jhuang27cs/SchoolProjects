Hmm I'm really not sure what the appeal for boba loca is other than the fact that it is the only real boba place within the 2 mile radius of UCLA. The atmostphere isn't that great and neither is the price. Actually, it's probably one of the most expensive boba places I've ever been to (ever check out quickly's or tapioca express?)

And I don't really see how the place is a good place to study. The tables are tiny, there's often loud drunk college kids and/or traffic rushing about outside on Broxton and Weyburn, and theres always not enough plugs for your laptops. 

The drinks are usually decent, but once in a while I get a bland drink that makes me very sad that I've spent almost 5 bucks for it. bleh
