This review is just for their lunch. It seems, from reading other reviews, that their menu offering is much larger and more diverse at night. Alas it was not meant to be. 

Stopped by for lunch on a Friday and was saddened to be a little restricted by their lunch menu. It was late (for lunch) though, so I guess I gotta give them props for seating us.

Anyway, it was just a bit disappointing after having seen a bunch of really good food pics on Yelp and then mostly denied of them upon entering the establishment. 
That being said, I ordered the duck quesadilla, crab cakes and sashimi and chirashi bowl app. As others have noted, Luna Red is mostly a tapas type of place. The aforementioned dishes were all pretty small and share-able. The quesadilla was pretty good as I liked the duck flavor along with the greens on top (parsley & peppery arugula). The crab cakes were meh IMHO and the chirashi bowl was decent. The rice wasn't the right type - not sticky, but the fish was pretty decent & fresh.

All in all, it was an okay experience. I'd say to go for dinner but skip lunch here~
