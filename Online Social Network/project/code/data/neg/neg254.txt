Holy guacamole what a nightmare. Went here for a quick meal while visiting my brother. When I asked the waiter what items on the menu were gluten free, he said he would find out and come back. That's fine, I'm glad he went to get more information. When he came back, he said "the bean tostada is the closest thing we have." I'm sorry. THE CLOSEST? When you're dealing with an allergy, "the closest" is NOT going to cut it. I was speechless and kind of confused, so I asked to see the chef. Instead, the manager came to the table, clearly pissed off that she had to talk to customers. She said that she would give me a tortilla with beans and cheese and lettuce. Then she said that there were no lard in the beans, so they're healthy (fyi, "healthy" does not mean gluten free) and then asked if tomatoes were gluten free. Um...WHAT? I don't care if you don't know what gluten free is: I'd be happy to inform you and give you the information you need to help people in the future. What I am not ok with is a manager being clearly upset that she has to answer questions and then saying that they can give me the "closest thing."
I did end up eating the bean tostada--the information I got out of her eventually led me to believe that it would be safe to eat. I didn't get sick or anything, but still the food was just plain old bad. It was a tiny tortilla with a bit of beans and a MOUNTAIN of lettuce. Not an exaggeration. it was actually about a 6 inch tall pile of lettuce. Then covered in shredded cheese. 
Overall: food is bad and the service is worst.
