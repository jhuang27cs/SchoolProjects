Single worst experience I've had at a tea place.  

We walk in and order two thai milk teas.  The girl behind the counter takes her sweet time making them, then gives us two tapioca teas.  We see that the teas aren't the distinct orange color of thai milk tea and say "Oh, that's not what we ordered."  

The girl flat-out refuses to believe us and she starts yelling: "Yes, this is exactly what you ordered.  You ordered tapioca tea."

We knew exactly what we ordered, because we always get thai milk tea, and yet she persists.  "That's what you ordered!  That's what you ordered!"

Not sure how a place can stay in business when they screw up this badly and blame it on the customers.
