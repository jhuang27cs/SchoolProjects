I've lived in new york my entire life I've never paid so much for dry cleaning.  They charge you extra for stains (umm, the reason i'm even going to the dry cleaners is for the stains!).

They also said they could get the tailor's chalk off automatically and i didn't have to point it out.  Get what... they didn't.  There are way too many dry cleaners in this city to waste your money here.
