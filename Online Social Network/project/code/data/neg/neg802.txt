I work at USC and frequent the Mercado la Paloma with my colleagues for lunch. Unfortunately, I had an awful experience at Thai Corner Food Express, an experience that was so appalling that I felt compelled  to write a yelp review (my first negative). Their service, wait time and food were of the lowest quality I have every experienced at a food court.

When I began my order, the young lady at the counter was very unfriendly and did not seem to know anything about their food options - continually looking back at the menu and responding , "HUH?!" if I had a question.  When I asked whether or not a soup or salad would suffice for one person, she finally responded by shrugging her shoulders. 

Once I decided to order the papaya salad with shrimp and fried shrimp roll appetizer (with no assistance), I waited with my party. After 25 - 30 minutes I still had not received any portion of my order. Meanwhile, everyone else who went to other restaurants were practically finished with their meals. When I went to the counter to check on my order, the same young lady at the register annoyingly stated that it was coming.

10-15 minutes later, my order came, and no apology was made for the 45 minute delay. My appetizer was cold, and there were only 2 shrimp in my papaya salad -- which consisted mostly of iceberg lettuce and  very little papaya.

I realize that you should not expect a high-end culinary experience when eating at a food court. However, the horrible service, absurd wait time and lackluster meal was something I've never experienced before. I hope that no other people from the neighborhood (USC or otherwise) continue to give business to this awful establishment. Everyone who witnessed their service was appalled, and our group of 6+ professionals have decided to never support them during future visits to Mercado La Paloma.
