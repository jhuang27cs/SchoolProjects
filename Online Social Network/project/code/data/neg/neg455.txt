For people like me that grew up with neither, Chipotle and Qdoba truly are the same thing, both of which are overpriced fresher than Taco Bell but not the freshest.  To me, this place is servicable should I go with a colleague but if I really want a burrito I could make one better myself.  I reserve my takeout Mexican money for some of Philly's better offerings like La Lupe.
