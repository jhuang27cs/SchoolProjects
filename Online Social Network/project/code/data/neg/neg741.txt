I ate at 3 Steeple Street for the first time on Valentine's Day.  It was the perfect spot for a romantic dinner--small, dark, but still fairly bustling.  There was a much younger crowd (20's) than I'm used to seeing at nice restaurants in Providence, which was cool.  I ordered the scallops wrapped in bacon with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Our food was delivered quickly which was very much appreciated, but my scallops were grainy and the bacon was soggy.  Not awful, but I definitely wouldn't order this again.  For desert we ordered a chocolate lava cake, which was so incredibly blah I swear they must have just ordered it pre-made from Sysco.   

3 Steeple Street also features two Providence restaurant scene staples: grilled cheese and mac and cheese.  Some day I will solve the mystery of why these two comfort foods seem to be on every menu in PVD...

If you don't mind paying a little more, Mill's Tavern has much better food than 3 Steeple Street, and the ambiance is just as good.
