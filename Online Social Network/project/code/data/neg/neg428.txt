I've known this place since they opened. I was happy to see a great looking eatery open up a block from where I live. The place has a great design - clean lines, white, silver, black tones, understated. Large wood community tables in the center, maybe too large though. 
The staff is not great. I've seen them screw up other people's orders besides mine. The last time I was there the waiter gave me the wrong sandwich (there are two that are similar on the menu, yet distinctly different) and he rudely told me that I was wrong! Not the nicest or smartest guy on the block. This was after I hadn't been there in ages due primarily to the embarassing service. The 'chefs' have been known to hang out in the dining room and hold loud conversations with other staff.  Once you get your drinks delivered to the table do not, I repeat, do not expect a refill. Which always makes me wonder, 'who trains these people'?
The food is hit or miss. Don't expect to order what is on the menu since they are out of a lot of the basics. The menu itself raves about their waffles. Had them once. They tasted like microwave food. More mushy than crispy. Certainly not worth the price. I can make a pot of coffee at home at a cheaper rate than a cup of coffee at this place and I can be sure to get a refill!
Wifi is great and they let you plug in to a socket, although wifi is only  available I believe weekday hours. Speaking of hours, this place opens late and closes early. Rather go to cafe Amrita four blocks away where the service is much friendlier and opens early enough to grab breakfast on the way to work and opens late since it becomes a bar at night.
i can't believe this place packs in the people. Proof that this neighborhood is ripe for new business!
