This Verizon store is just awful.  I regret that I even have to give this location 1 star in order to write a review.  Do not buy into the reviews about this place being great, I'm 210% sure that those reviews were written by the employees themselves or their family.  First off, they are plain rude, which might be fine if they were competent.  They are not competent.  What they will do is inconveinence you for 10-20 minutes while they fumble around CLEARLY unsure of what they are doing.  You will ask, no you will BEG for someone else to help you, or to have a manager come out.  They will rudely refuse and claim that they can handle whatever issue it is that they have shown you for the last 20 minutes they can't handle.  And of course your time isn't of ANY value to them, so you should wait another 20-30 minutes while they incompentently fumble around.  I will never again give this store my time or service.  Frankly I think they just hire people that are bi-lingual, it doesn't seem to matter if they know anything besides being able to communicate with the spanish speaking clientele.  Although I have to feel sorry for those people because incompetent service in Spanish is still incompetent service.

Do yourself a favor and go to the Upland store at the Colonies.  Every member of the staff I have met there has been courteous, gracious and knowledgeable.
