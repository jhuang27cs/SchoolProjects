I came here for dinner. We ordered an angel hair with marinara, and an angel hair with primavera (think marinara but with yellow bell peppers and broccoli). I also got the free pasta salad. Overall, the pasta's are pretty bland, and the garlic bread doesn't taste like garlic. All of this for $15, so it's not that cheap. However, the pasta salad was pretty good. 

Overall, I probably wouldn't go here again. Honestly, the pasta tastes like one of those TV dinner microwaveable meals. (and those only cost a dollar)
