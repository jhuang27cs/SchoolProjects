I created a Yelp account just to write this review.
I'll try to be short and to the point.

I had the Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen ($9.24 with tax). 
The broth was watery and tasteless.
Noodles were a bit tough and thick... not good if you want to enjoy the non-savory broth.
The menma (bamboo shoots?) had a plastic-y rubbery texture. Didn't eat them.
The meat slices were thin and tasteless.
Congrats on not messing up the half of the boiled egg. Except they forgot to put that in my friend's ramen.
Ramen? How dare I call it that. It's a disgrace to my country to be associated with the bowl of crap they served me.

If you want ramen, there might be another ramen place that might be down Westwood Blvd a block past Wilshire that might be more authentic (and they might also have parking in the back). 

Westwood needs better restaurants. Please.
