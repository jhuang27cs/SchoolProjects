I purchased a Samsung Series 9 computer from here because they have a nice selection and let you play with the machines before hand.  

After taking the computer home, I found it had major issues. The function keys did not work and there was severe backlight bleeding from the corners of the screen. I immediately took the laptop back and a tech named TJ attempted to fix it by doing a windows update.

Here are my complaints about his approach.

1) any technical person should know that a windows update won't fix the problems i had.

2) TJ proceeded with the updates without checking with me or even thinking about how much time would be wasted. Once he started, the machine could not be interrupted and i had to wait an hour for the updates to be done. 

3)after waiting an hour, windows update fixed nothing.

When he finally diagnosed enough and agreed this laptop had issues beyond his abilities, he talked to his manager  Sherie and they gave me the option of  sending it back to their repair center. When i asked how long that would take they said 2 weeks/maybe longer/ they don't really know. I didn't buy a brand new laptop just to wait 2-3 weeks for them to repair it and get it back tinkered with.

The right thing to do after wasting so much of my time was to exchange the unit for another one.  When i asked this they said i'd have to pay 500$ more because they no longer carry my exact model and the newer series 9 costed more due to a newer cpu.
