Literally, I have expirenced faaaaaaaaaaar better, from super small community runs.. 

You think NIKE- 
-Money
-Organization
-Serious runners
-A good time
Right?


Nike Human Race =

-97% High School and College Frat Crowd who addmitidly announced they had never run in an organized race (THIS = A MAJOR HOLY SH+T BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIKE 7,500 INEXPIRENCED RUNNERS, WITH NO RUNNING ETTIQUETE, AND NOT A CLUE IN THE WORLD) 

-Nike, coraled all the runners on a 5x5 piece of grass and made us stand there for an hour, it was a discusting, sweaty, stinky, bumpy, mess.

-19 Year old girls with their arse hanging out of their running shorts (also known as boy short undies from American Apperal) seriously?

-Water stations like 2?!

-The runners were so pushy, (literally) I was so worried that someone was going to be badly hurt, just due to the lack of expirence in the crowd, and polish it off with a midnight run? Half the people could not see in the dark!

- At the finish line they ran out of water quickly (big no no) people were way dehydrated and dying (kinda)

-I got a medal (read- crappy dog tag?) they put no effort, they all said 10k even though a ton of runners ran the 5k?minner detail I know.. But its Nike my friends.They ran out of medals because there were no volunteers to pass them out, so greedos were taking like 3 of em (saw it with my own stunned little eyes...)

-People were hungey at the end, not a piece of fruit or bread in sight, but hey they had Pop Chips! grrrrrrrreat... 

- I really cant believe, how cheap Nike is, I am glad I did it with friends, it totally evened out the disbelief, I feel like those youngins that might have became runners, are totally never going to consider running ever again due to this one race... But Nike is so rich because they are cheaper then the 99 Cents store... Nike suck a Rooster... seriously. 

-Oh! PS... packet pick up you ask? Oh you mean the single table on the USC campus with the running shirt and crummy iron on stickers? oh, that.... Ya that wasnt to hot either... 

-They ran
