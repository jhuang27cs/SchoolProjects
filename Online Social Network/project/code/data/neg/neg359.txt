I witnessed a dog walker abusing dogs that he was walking.  

I saw him tie a group of dogs to the post outside the office on the day of the hurricane, when there were strong winds.  In one instance he held his foot down on the leash, close to the collar of one dog so that its face was forced into the asphalt.  The dog was yelping.  It was disgusting!  I also see him lingering around the corner of the building, talking on his cell for several minutes.  I would be livid if I were paying a walker and discovered he was not walking my dog and not treating him appropriately.  I contacted animal control and they advised that I contact the owner of the business first as they do not have the capacity to monitor the walkers.  I spoke to the son of the owner and hoped not to see this walker again.  He is the only dog walker that I see every morning, walking 3-5 dogs at a time.  I live in the neighborhood and I am disappointed that this guy is still walking dogs.
