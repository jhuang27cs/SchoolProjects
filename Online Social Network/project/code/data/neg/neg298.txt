Our experience with Bash Pepper has been unfortunate. We live in, and are restoring an architect
designed home in Urbana, Illinois. We have flat roofs. In 2009, Bash Pepper applied a Lucas # 3000
thermoplastic aluminum coating to our upper roof, and lower carport roof.


Unfortunately for us, and the integrity of our home, the upper roof is cracked throughout its surface, and oozes water from under the membrane coating. The lower roof is pocked with bubbles of various sizes. Some of the bubbles have broken open.

Their salesman was extremely positive and enthusiastic about the Lucas product after looking at our roof and told us that the Lucas system was the ideal coating and completely compatible with our preexisting surfaces.  Prior to applying the coating, Bash Pepper "prepared " our roof areas, using a Lucas product. At no time did he, or any employee of the company express any concern about either of our roof areas, or have any misgivings about the longevity of the Lucas surface. The original proposal stated a 10 year warranty.

When we discovered the deteriorated condition of our roofs, after a recent leak, we immediately called the company. The original salesman promptly arrived to check our roofs, and appeared genuinely shocked by the condition of the carport, and upper roofs, promising to take action to remedy their defective job.


However, after repeated calls to Bash Pepper over a period of two weeks, the elderly owner of the company came to our home, examined the surfaces, and blamed the entire problem on our old roof. Although my husband extended every courtesy to him, he was immediately defensive, and offered my husband no apology or explanation for the condition of the roof areas, nor any recourse. 

Because of Bash Pepper's defective job we are in urgent need of a new roof and we are out $3700.
