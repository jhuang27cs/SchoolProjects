Someone ranked this 5 bloody stars?!  Either they've never had great sushi before or they're shills.  It's really scary to read the high marks people have assigned to this restaurant.  This place was over priced, the food did NOT appear fresh, and on top of that the service was horrendous.  And when I asked for extra ginger - I got 3 more slivers and even that was on the "wilty" side.  $40 bucks for some tempura (most of it was in crumbs (not kidding) and not so fresh sashimi. This place is in the midwest I realize that but that's no excuse - there used to be a great sushi place right across the street called Fuji.  This place - Yamato was a real disappointment.   Next time?  I'd rather eat dirt.  And this makes it the second time I've trusted Yelp to help me find a place and been so sorely disappointed.  If this keeps up I wont' be using this place much for more than digital toilet paper.
