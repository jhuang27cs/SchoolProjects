Who doesn't love a cupcake?

Who wouldn't be tempted to grab a little sweet treat daily if there was a cupcake shop right across the street from where you live!?

Sorry, but these small, tasteless, way too expensive for a little cake, but kinda pretty cupcakes do not live up to what I expected.

The frosting is not at all flavourful and the consistency is 'bleh'. Dry...almost like day old cake. The cream cheese frosting on the carrot cake cupcakes is not balanced, the key lime frosting was tasted like sugar with whipped unsalted butter and no flavour.

They are so top heavy with frosting... not good on a little dry cupcake.

I have had Sweet cupcakes numerous times....only TWICE have I gone in, the rest were work/friend gifts.

So TWO stars for a cool idea, cute interior, and catering services.

Boo :( I guess it is probably best there isn't an delicious and tempting bakery right across the street from my apartment!
