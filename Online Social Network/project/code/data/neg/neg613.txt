There are not really any other sit-down, family-owned pizzerias (maybe Allegros?) in University City (I don't know why, there should be some more...), so my friends and I decided to give Pizza Rustica a try since there are always so many people sitting outside enjoying their meals...we went for the University Dining Days $15 dollar promo deal.

Anyhow, the artichoke dip and chocolate chipped cookies are definitely really good, but the services is just so terrible that I will probably not go back. My friends were trying to order their promotional beer, but they didn't have that, and then she tried to order an italian soda, but they said they didn't have the "materials to make the italian soda..." what does that mean?? Also, our waiter kept forgetting to bring our water, and said "I'm so sorry" like five times, even before giving us the bill, basically re-affirming the fact that the service was bad.

anyhow, overall, the food was good, but the services was TERRIBLE. I may just order out next time.
