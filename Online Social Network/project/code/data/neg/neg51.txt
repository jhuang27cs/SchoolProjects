Holy crap their customer service is bad. I've been to this location dozens of times and I'm pretty sure they have either screwed up our order or left something out every time. The only reason I go back is because the food is good, but always check your bag because they never put any condiments, napkins or utensils. They often give you the wrong drink too if your going through the drive thru. Such a hassle!
