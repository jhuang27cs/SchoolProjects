While the folks working there were nice enough, the Happy Hour on Saturday Night was quiet, the beer selection weak, and the wings sub-par (tasted fresh from the Costco freezer.)  The kids meals were fair in size but their kids burgers were very dry and overcooked.  After the apps and the kids meals came, I decided to skip a real dinner there.  That said, 2 kids meals, 2 kids milks, one margarita, and wings was about $30 - during happy hour no less!  Despite hoping that I would like it, I won't be returning.
