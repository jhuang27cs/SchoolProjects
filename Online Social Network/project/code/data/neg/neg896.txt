This place has been lauded for years, but guess what, the Emperor has no clothes. They give you a huge stack of napkins with your burger. And after the first bite you know why, it slips and slides all over the place, the bun is thin and melts into the burger, you end up holding a big mess. I guess it's the big chunk of iceberg lettuce. Not friendly either.
