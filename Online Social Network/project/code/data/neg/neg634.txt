First off this isn't necessarily a BAD place to eat its just extremely hit and miss.  I'll go there one time and its very tasty then I'll go again and the food will be really bland.   I've had the gobbler burger, chicken enchiladas, hummus, blueberry and orange milk shakes.  the chicken enchiladas are really good so are their shakes.  As for the gobbler burger...season it up!  I had to pretty much douse it in ketchup, partly my fault I could of asked for more thousand island or something but still.  However, their hummus is almost inedible - NO taste AT ALL.  My mom said it was the worst hummus she's ever had and I can't disagree with her.  I would of much rather paid extra and gone to Big Sky, at least they're consistently good.
