I order pad thai and my noodle were over done and stuck together.. my child kids bento box I order chicken teriyaki and the fruit were looking grayish not fresh and the beans were warm but the chicken teriyaki was cold in the middle... noodle was okay not the best I tasted but good enough..please take the salty beans out of kids meal!
