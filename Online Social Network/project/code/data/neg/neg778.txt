Eh, I didn't think an awful lot of this place.  It was perfectly fine for a few hours on a Friday night with a group of friends, but I wouldn't want to spend the whole night there.

The entryway is a pain.  First you go down a scary alley-type walkway to enter the place. Then once you get inside, you have to go down the stairs, which is usually backed up with people.  The worst part about this is when you are planning on leaving and the line is long and you can't get by all the people to get up the stairs and out the door.  Frustrating.

Inside is fine, although it was quite dark, which made playing darts rather difficult.  Moving around was rather tight, as there were lots of tables and little nooks and crannies everywhere throughout.

Overall...I just wasn't feeling it when I was there, but I'd come back here and give it another shot.
