Stanley's Hamburgers are tasty. They are a bit too pricey for this location in Providence considering that you can just walk across the street and pay half the price for the same type of burger. Not my first choice for a burger but if your looking for a burger only joint in this area than Stanley's Hamburgers is the place for you.
