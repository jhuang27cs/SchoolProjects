For me, Carrburritos was more about quantity than quality.

If you want a shovel-full of 'Tex-Mex' ingredients stuffed into a "big-as-your-head" burrito, then you will love Carrburritos.

Personally, I'd rather get something half the size, with fresh ingredients that didn't taste like they came out of a can, and that had an interesting mix of flavors & spices.  Because of that, I've only been to Carrburritos three times... generally I'll drive a mile further down the road to the taqueria instead.

So if you're used to Taco Bell, you will (correctly) think that Carrburritos is way better.

But if you're looking for good Tex-Mex or Mexican food, you'll probably find Carrburritos very average.
