I would not recommend getting bagels from this place. My husband and both ordered bagels on morning and watched as the "chef" pulled out the bagel, sliced it in half and proceeded to squash the bagel between his bare hands until it was flat enough to fit in the toaster. 

The place is a working class restaurant, which is refreshing in the midst of Cambridge, but please just buy a bigger toaster!
