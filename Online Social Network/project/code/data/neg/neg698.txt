Went for lunch with a co-worker and ordered a large "Mopac" pizza.  When the pizza arrived, it looked very nice, until my co-worker found a rather awful looking hair in the pizza.  It was not the kind of hair that grows on the top of your head.

We immediately reported it.  The girl helping us was too cool for school, and gave us a rather anemic and disinterested apology.  When we went downstairs to get our money back and leave, she was showing what appeared to be the manager.  He said nothing to us.  She was silent for the entire 8 minutes it took her to figure out how to open the cash register and give us our money back.

I really want to like this place, but as long as they keep employing hipsters that are too good for the job, and as long as they have a chronically dirty restroom, my money will go elsewhere.

I can understand a hair on the pizza (but not THAT kind of hair).  I cannot forgive the bad service and generally filthy facility.

Done.
