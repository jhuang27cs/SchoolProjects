I have two memories of this place.  One was my freshman year with a group of friends who found this place to be awful and spent the whole night carving items into the tables with their knives.  The other was an awkward date.

Both times food wasn't great, and the atmosphere was kinda creepy.  When I was accepted to UNC everyone told me I had to go to the Rat.  Then when I got there, no one I knew voluntarily went there.  I can see why they closed.
