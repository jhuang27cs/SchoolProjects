I stumbled upon (and ultimately decided on) 411 West because it was clearly the most popular and busiest place on this strip of restaurants and shops on a Monday night. 

It's basically an Olive Garden that's owned by a local restaurant company with some kitsch slapped on the walls inside. However, I will say it was much more aesthetically pleasing than an Olive Garden. If I was a UNC student, I'd get a snack and sit by the window here (and eat artichoke dip). 

Artichoke dip was super garlicky and good. I had beef tenderloin over truffled mac and cheese. Sounds delicious, right? It wasn't. Mediocre. Beef was flavorless, and the mac and cheese wasn't anything special. A waste of truffle oil, if you ask me (it was a special). My companion's artichoke and sun-dried tomato pizza was only marginally better than mediocre. Millionaire pie was yummy, in a white trash sort of way (sugary sugar goodness). 

On the upside, Monday is apparently 1/2 price on a bottle of wine night.
