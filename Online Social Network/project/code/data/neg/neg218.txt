Having worked in the MIT area for a few years now, I'm as aware as everyone else how meager the lunch options can be. Any place that opens is guranteed an initial surge of traffic.

Unfortunately my visit to Mexicali will be a one time thing. The menu was unnecessarily complicated, involving choosing a burrito size and each individual ingredient. The fillings were mediocre at best, and the staff seemed completely incompetent. Made me long for the cool professionals of Boca and Annas.

The worst part was the fold. My burrito ended up looking like a softball. Luckily I was eating it back in the office, because it immediately fell apart over my plate and required a fork to finish.

Save your time and stick to the trucks, Boca or Annas.
