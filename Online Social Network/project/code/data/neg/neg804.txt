I made a reservation for my birthday on Friday night at Om, which was also during Restaurant Week. The reservation was for four people, but one of my friends got stuck waiting for her bus and couldn't get there. Om refused to seat us with three, stating that it's their policy. I thought this was pretty unreasonable given that there isn't much difference b/t seating three and four people at a table. The staff didn't even seem apologetic or anything, just like "oh well, tough luck." We left and went to Redline and had a nice time.
