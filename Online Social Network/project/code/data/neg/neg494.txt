I've been to this place several times with people from my work. The burgers are decent here. Nothing particularly great, but they have a good condiments bar. Their fried zucchini isn't very good though. The problem with this place is while it tastes decent while you are eating, it doesn't seem to sit to well afterwards. We often go to lunch and have a meeting afterwards...on those days we go here you can kind of see it hitting everyone about a hour afterwards.
