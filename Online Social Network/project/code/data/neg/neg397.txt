This place was a whole lotta talk, not alot of action...The guy who served me looked like some guy who just had gotten dumped and hadn't had a day off in a month..seriously, that was what his attitude was like. ruuuuude. Never been here before so excuse me for asking what's your favorite cookie and getting a snarl in return. Cool, a $1.50 icecream sandwich, but it's dreyers icecream and the cookies wern't even that great, my mom makes better homemade ones..and they don't even offer milk to sell! WTF? Annnd...they only take CASH.
