Ugh, yet another mediocre Mexican restaurant in Seattle. Do we really need another one? To top it off, the prices are ridiculous and they're a chain which, according to word of mouth, is owned by McDonalds. Not the kind of business I would feel good about supporting, even if their food were terrific.
