Definitely not a place I would return.  Cute bartenders but horrible food.  The burger looked like it had some how come out of a tube and then sliced into patties.  Gross to say the least. When I told my a friend where I had gone they asked my opinion on the pizza, which I did not have.  So maybe this is a pizza place only but I'm not a fan of the deep dish Chicago style any way. The place really reminded me of an applebee's, or perkins, or any other restaurant like those.
