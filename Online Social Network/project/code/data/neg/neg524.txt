Typical old-fashioned diner. I had a hamburger with fries, and neither was bad. The burger wasn't as greasy as I'd expect from a diner and the fries were, well, fries, really hard to mess up fries. The waitress was also nice enough.

It was the aftermath, my stomach did not agree with my taste buds. For that, it gets 3 stars.
