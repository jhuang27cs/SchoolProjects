honestly i think this place is pretty freaking expensive for the crap they give you. what happened to the "old (soy sauce mix)" boiled egg thing?? and the sour vegetable with mince meat??? is it only an LA thing? 

the chicken tastes the same as all the other asian drink places. but it comes with this crappy ass mixed vege thing straight from the frozen vege bag. wtf. and i dont remember what the other side (if there is one) was. i never come here anymore. blah
