I was aware of the prices i would face before coming here but was unfortunately not aware of the poor quality.
After a difficult morning deciding whether to go to super 88 and get some shopping done or come here and go to brunch my friend convinced me of the later.  Bad Move

Although i can not complain about my tomato and gorgonzola soup I will complain about my salad.  The pear and edive salad left a greased bitter unfullfilled taste in my mouth.  I also requested to have the bacon removed and it was not (mistakes happen).  I could not finish the salad, not due to size, but lack of intrest.
I left this establishment with a dent in my wallet and only a strong desire for some more pear
