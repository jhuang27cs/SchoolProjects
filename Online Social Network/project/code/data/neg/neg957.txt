I had Burger Joe's where the old Fat Louie's was so maybe my heart was looking for a good Chicago Dog and ended up with the Jerk Burger...not impressed.  The service was more disappointing as well.  The food was just alright...no ooohhh.  The jerk burger is not marinated in jerk spice...it tastes more like a burger and they poured a jerk sauce on top.  The fries in a brown bag were either overcooked or recooked.  Not worth the money in my opinion.
