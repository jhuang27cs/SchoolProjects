Took my boyfriends suit to get dry cleaned, when I picked it up I had to wait a really long time which was petty absurd because I was the only one there and they had 3 employees behind the counter but only 1 doing work. The price was reasonable but when my bf put his suit on, he noticed they had written his name in sharpie inside all the pieces - even the back of the tie. Even though the markings weren't visible, it was sill irritating. 

We found a really awesome dry cleaner (Runners) which was always reasonable, the owner (or manager) was always friendly and remembered your face and name. We did a lot of business here but sadly the Greenfield location closed. 

Footers has so many locations in Pittsburgh in convenient locations but it is definitely worth seeking out some other place.
