I think I must have hit them on a bad day - almost everything tasted "off."  Maybe it was me.  Starting with the duck sauce for the egg rolls - tasted moldy.  The iced tea tasted so musty I asked for a soda instead.  The pho broth was salty, and the tendon in my steak/flank/tendon combo was funky.  Some might say that's what I get for ordering tendon, but it doesn't usually taste like that - this was gamey and nasty, and not in a good way.  The server was really nice, and the space is nicer than Pho Thaison a couple of doors down.
