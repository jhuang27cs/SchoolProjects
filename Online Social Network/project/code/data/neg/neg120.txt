I admit it, I fell into the hype. A huge line edging around the alleyway are the norm so I swooped in today when I saw that there were relatively few people waiting in line. The customer service was as sweet as the frosting - but, like the cupcakes, was lacking in anything that involved complexity. I feel like the line is built from intentionally slow service to build up hype. I ordered the hot red velvet, black and white and got the free cupcake of the day (chocolate marshmallow). They have a habit of taking their sweet time boxing up the cupcakes before finishing up your order. They accidentally gave my order to another person and totally forgot about my order. I brought it up with the cashier and she quickly checked the tickets and said I was next. Nothing else. Next was 10 minutes later after I asked again. I was charged for my free cupcake and I had to go back to get it remedied. The cupcakes were well packaged, I'll give it that.

The cupcakes were lovely little things though. The taste? The frosting is decent but all sugar - cut it with plenty of milk. The cakes didn't really have a chocolate flavor but had a good moist texture though. Hype is what keeps this place in business. Including the little snafu, I waited about 1/2 hour and spent 7 bucks on 3 cupcakes. Even if there was another free cupcake involved, I won't be back.
