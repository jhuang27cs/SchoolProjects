This place is so disgusting but it doesn't surprise me since it's on the Ave. Ok so here are the reasons why I never want to go here anymore:

1) Homeless people are hanging around outside and inside all the time

2) They actually had to hire security since people (homeless or cracked out) were harrassing people through the drive through-I experienced this once when a lady wedged herself between the wall and the drivers side giving us this long pathetic story of why she needed money, and then she got mad when we refused and hit our car with her hand!! I was close to punching her face after that but she was so coked out she probably didn't realize what was going on

3) They ALWAYS forget at least one item whenever I order. Most of the time I check but I can't remember the last time they got my order right.

4) Sometimes the staff can be very rude, I understand that you hate your job, it's not my fault you work there but I understand that you're not so peppy and upbeat when you take my order. However, I do NOT tolerate outright rudeness. For example. Once I pulled up and I usually wait for them to say "Hi can I help you" so that I know they're done helping the previous customer, and the guy says "HELLO is somebody there??" I ignore that and order and he's like "Geez is that all?" as if I ordered 50 things. I ordered 3 f*cking things. One included tacos and usually they ask what kind of sauce you want and he didn't ask so I said 'Is there hot sauce in there" and he says "NO how can I read your mind?" OH HELL NO. That was what pushed me over the edge, I can't stand that behavior!! Unfortunately I have made several trips back there on late nights when nothing else is open, and I never saw that guy again so I'm hoping he was fired. Serves him right. Anyways go to Memo's next door, better service and better food or Burger Hut that's open to 2 I think!
