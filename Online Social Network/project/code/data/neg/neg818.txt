Cute place, it really is "Tiny". Anyway, I didn't like the roast beef sub b/c the beef was too thick to bite in a sandwich and the bread is a hard roll. My bf got the ham sub and he said it was "alright". Pricy subs and they don't come with a side. Cute place. I'd try it again when I get bored of everything else in the area.
