***Long Story***

We were looked up and down by the Maitre'd. We were the first of three couples w/o reservations, but seated last. (The other couples were older and Caucasian.) We were seated at the worst table in the bar, though better tables were available. The waiter was slow, seemed perturbed that he had to wait on us, and refused to look either of us in the eye. After 20 minutes I finally got our drinks from the bar myself, once I finally got the attention of the super-model bartender that never learned to smile. The waiter brought my food first and my wife's food 10 minutes later. I complained to the host and got excuses, no apologies. When we left, the host was holding the door for another couple, (older, Caucasian) he looked me in the eye, and let the door close on my wife.

I'm giving my sole 1 star review to Harvest. I'll retire the 1 star for Harvest. They've earned a special place in my heart. This was the worst, most elitist experience possible. It genuinely made me wonder if they were not only elitist, but racist. Incredible.
