This place is as close to Applebee's as a restaurant can get without being a chain.  The restaurant deems itself "international" because it has pasta, steak, quesadillas and a chicken stir fry on the menu?  Nothing about the menu is exciting.  Their healthy options are basically plain grilled chicken or salmon.  The food was completely average and unmemorable.  The service was slightly below average.  We kind of felt like we were being rushed out at 7:30.  That being said, there was no one else in the restaurant (never a good sign), so maybe they wanted to close
