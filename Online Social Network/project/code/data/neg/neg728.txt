I will never go back after the service I had last night. 

Food (that was not ours) was left on our table for TWENTY MINUTES. We asked tables around us if the food was theirs. It wasn't. We tried to send them back. We stopped the server, Nicolette, and told her that the food was not ours. She said (direct quote) "Just let them sit there." Ten minutes later they were still there. Since our food was taking so long, and we figured the food was cold and not servable to another group, we dug in. 

Nicolette came around the corner and said "Did you eat those nachos?"

"Yes"

"You should have sent them back"

All three of us replied in an exasperated voice: "We tried!"

"There is no reason to raise your voice. You are out of line. That's $7"

We all pulled out our wallets

"You have to pay for it"

"We are"

"You can't just take things that aren't yours and not pay for it"

"Honey, we're going to pay for it"

And then, 2 minutes later, with food still on our plates, she tried to take away the food we had just paid for. When we asked her not to, she accused us of yelling at her. 

This was a fine place, but because of Nicolette's rude, condescension I will NEVER go here again. We never raised our voices, we laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation, and we weren't drunk. 

Also, a place that would try to serve food after it had been sitting on someone else's table for 30 minutes should be looked at by the health inspector.
