[Update: This place is out of business.]

Located across from a park in a residential neighborhood, you'd never notice this sandwich shop unless you slept in the park or got lost. Luckily, you probably have no need for it.

My co-workers and I use to call this place the "Default Deli" because it was the closest sandwich shop to our office. One by one everyone got tired of it and defectors formed a "Subway Train" opting to walk a few extra blocks to the local Subway or Il Capo.

There's nothing especially wrong with it but they just seemed annoyed with extraordinary requests (like a different bread). My biggest pet peeve was watching the sandwich artist work inefficiently, contorting his body every time he needed something.

Tip to Eddie: put all the ingredients on or above one side of the counter so that you can work without twisting around. You're gonna hurt your back!

I actually don't think it's Eddie's anymore, but the new owner kept the name and added a sub-name, something like "Roma Italian Market".
