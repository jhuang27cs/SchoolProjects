Wife thought the modern look of place was intriguing so we stopped by for a quick bite. 25 minutes later, we both agreed it was one of the worst dinning out decisions ever made. The pizza was unimpressive, other than the fresh ingredients, it was no better than a store bought freezer pizza (we did learn later from watching the in-restaurant advertising that the pizza doughs are in fact, froze and shipped to the restaurants). One of the most interesting thing we saw was 10 employees in the kitchen and only 3 were working while the rest chatted up, incredibly inefficient. We also learn that the oven they use at Quinzo's to heat the subs is also the type they use to heat the pizzas at Naked, I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw that on the advertisement, no wonder their pizza tasted so awful. 

Anyways, I would recommend better judgment if anyone suggests that one should try the pizza there. It's actually worse than Papa John's, if that's possible.
