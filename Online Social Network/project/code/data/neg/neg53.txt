This place isn't all that it thinks it's cracked up to be.  Yes, it's true that I couldn't find the Peter Himmelman album I was looking for, but yeah, I'll admit it has a good selection.  But it doesn't have to advertise that it has "the best selection in Berkeley" when it's 1/2 a block away from another record store (you all know which one I'm talking about) that is roughly identical in most ways.  Second, what is the point of the 11% student discount?  Are you trying to one-up the "other" record shop, which offers a measly 10% discount (but slightly better prices)?

This place is such like the 3rd grade bully who thinks he's bigger and smarter than everyone else, except that it's an inanimate object bullying another inanimate object.  wtf.
