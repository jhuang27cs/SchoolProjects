I know the owners, and that still didnt sway my opinion...great place if you like a hidden spot. Hard to find for some, but nice restaurant, good look since their facelift some years ago. 

the menu is a bit small and not enough variety or updates/changes. i LOVE their zuchini bread, omelettes, and their Diane Salad...those you can't go wrong with.

another thing i love about green street, is their service. for themost part, everyone is helpful and friendly. the servers and waiters/waitresses are great.

sometimes u can even spot a few celebs, dodger players here and there.
