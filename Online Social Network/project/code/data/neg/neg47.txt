I'm only giving this place one star because I cannot give it zero.

The service at this restaurant is absolutely abominable, and the food is not even good to make up for it. I have been here twice and received horrible treatment each time. The first time I asked for sriracha sauce and the waitress told me that they didn't have any, even though sriracha fried rice is clearly on the advertising boards. When we asked for lemons and straws, my friends and I were given disparaging looks as if we had asked for squid ink and caviar.

Tonight, I found a fly in my water and reported it to the waitresses, expecting some sort of re-compensation, but the waitresses did not even apologize. Instead, they brought me another glass of water. I start going back up to them, and before I even open my mouth, the waitress glares at me and spits out, "No." Shocked, I ask, "excuse me?" and she replies impatiently, "You're not getting a discount." I was indignant; I have never received such disrespectful service before in my life. I tell her reasonably that under normal circumstances, restaurants would provide free compensation just for any sort of foreign object, and that all I was asking for was a 30% discount. The waitress insisted that I do not deserve any sort of discount because "It was not a fly, it was just a little bug." 

I ask to speak to the manager, the girl says that the manager would not come out to see me, and that I could take a 10% discount or that she would call the police. Two minutes later, she changes her story and tells me that the manager is not there. Seeing that I was getting nowhere, I take the 10% discount and tell my friends that we are not paying any tip.

We get our checks and see that they've charged us an 18% gratuity for "parties of 5 and up."

Save yourselves the frustration and do not go to this restaurant. The waitresses and the management there do not deserve your business.
