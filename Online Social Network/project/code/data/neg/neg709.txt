I can not believe this place got anything more than 1 star! 
My coworker and I had a taste for Thai food and wanted to try Trio House near USC. We was a little alarmed when we notice a "B" rating in the window but decided to go inside since it looked cleaned from the street. Once we walked through the door, we were greeted right away. However, we're distracted by the emptiness of the restaurant for being so big. Once we sat down, I noticed a huge fly next to my seat ... (At least I thought it was). After staring at this so called "fly" I realized it was a ROACH!!! By the time the waitress came with our water, I told her "Thank you but no thank you." And we walked out quickly and went across street to Mikoshi ... BTW they have an "A" rating
