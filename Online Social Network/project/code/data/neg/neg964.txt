This CVS pharmacy is just dreadful. I would advise you to fill your prescriptions elsewhere. I've tried to fill 4 prescriptions here for my family in the last 3 months and the following have happened:

- they have claimed not to receive a prescription which the doctor's office called in. Twice.

- they have been late on prescriptions and told us to come back the next day after 12pm. Which is a long time to wait for a much-needed medicine.

- they have dispensed drugs in the name of the wrong daughter, causing us to have to pay for them because our insurance wouldn't cover them.

- they have dispensed drugs without any meaningful instructions at all. This was only discovered upon arriving home.

- they have given us liquid medication for a baby, with the instruction to take 1ml twice daily, and they haven't given us a syringe with which to dispense it. This was also only discovered upon arriving home.

Boo, Carrboro CVS, I have relied on your sister stores in several other metropolitan areas. I will be taking my business elsewhere.
