When my fiancee and I went to U of I, Evo was one of our favorite restaurants. We would go there all the time for delicious bubble tea and Chinese food. I was especially found of the House Fried Rice. You would think fried rice tastes the same everywhere but the spices that Evo used and the gigantic pieces of chicken and shrimp made it out of this world.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. We took a trip to see the campus and made sure to stop at Evo. Something has really happened to the quality of the food. Except for the bubble tea, nothing really tasted the same as when we last went to Evo, and we were pretty disappointed. If we still lived in the area, we would still go to Evo for bubble teas and the occasional meal but it would not be the regular restaurant-of-choice that it once was.
