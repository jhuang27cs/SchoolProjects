I dunno about this place.  There's all this rave, but I just see it as ridiculously expensive small portioned, mediocre food that is not worth the price.

A soup I got was the literally the size of a teacup!  3 real spoonfuls and I would be done; but they succeeded in sizing it up with little itty bitty spoons that tricked the eater who had to take 10 scoops instead of 3.

The salad had a record of 5 fork bites!  I know that is considered very elegant and formal in some cases, but I personally would like a salad that I can't eat in under 35 seconds.

The food was alright, but it definetly wasn't worth the price.  I felt extremely guilty spending so much without even a full stomach - I had to raid my fridge at home to satisfy my hunger!

But, it you like this elegant styled pricey and not filling dinner, that's okay too.  I just prefer to be quite satisfied in the tummy...and in the wallet.
