Please don't rent from this company.  Their customer service is awful.  They still owe me over $350 that took over 4 months to even get a response over.

They pretend to manage properties, but they don't.  We reported several problems with the property, and they refused to fix the problem.  The basement was covered in mold, and the solution for the owner was to install 4 dehumidifiers at a cost of $120 a month.  It was on its own dedicated circuit, so I could track to cost to the penny.

Townside, instead of managing the property, threatened to sue me if I unplugged the dehumidifiers, but refused to fix the mold problem or reimburse me.  Their response was, "We contacted the owner... What else can we do?"  Disgusting.  I had to pester them for months to receive the $1600+ that they owed me after I moved across the country.

I'm begging you, even though they have the most houses in Blacksburg, trust me, they will rob you and not blink an eye.  The manager of the company eventually sent me a nasty letter saying they did everything they could, and referenced a phantom message he apparently sent me, that when asked to present, couldn't.

STAY AWAY. STAY AWAY.  I wish someone had told me what kind of company this was before I rented there, and I'm hoping this helps at least one person out there.

Humbly,
A former customer
