If I could give them a zero I would. I ended up having to go to them after my windshield got cracked by tire tread on the freeway. There was glass everywhere. My preferred body shop was booked up for a month. So I went with Holmes because my insurance recommended them and because my preferred place said it would be hard for Holmes to screw up. 

First, they said someone would help me in a couple of minutes. It then became 20 minutes. Then before I knew it the person that was supposed to look at my car left already. They told me I had to take my car because it couldn't stay there. So I had to drop it off at my Dad's place.

The next day I go back with my car I end up waiting almost an hour after they had said it would be a few minutes. They inspect the car and give me the estimate. They tell me it'll be ready in a couple of weeks.

I get the call my car is ready. So I go to pick it up. I get in and there's still glass in my car! I go back and make them vacuum it. It gets better from here. A day or so later it starts to drizzle. I try to use my windshield wipers and the wipers go down like they're locked into place. I go back yet again to get the wipers fixed. I wish I was making up the next part but I go to use defrost on my windshield the next morning. Glass comes out of the vents!

I thought everything was okay after the glass was finally gone. When my windshield got cracked, part of the roof on my car got dented too. They replaced my windshield but I don't know what they did to my roof because my car started to leak when it rained. Luckily I got the leak fixed before any major damage. Needless to say I will never go to Holmes again.
