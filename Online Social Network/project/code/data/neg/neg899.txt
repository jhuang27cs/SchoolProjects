I don't get the place.  Why is this supposed to be good?  I thought it was a horrible place and the food was not great.  The atmosphere is dreadful. The drinks were expensive and the service lacking. Why? Why? Why? I just don't get it. Maybe I'm some sort of ludite but I just don't see the point of walking around and selection food like this.
