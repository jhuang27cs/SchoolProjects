Note that I have never used their tailor service, only reviewing their cleaning/dry cleaning practice here.

I was a big advocate of this place because of the good price, flexibility, convenience (we live nearby) and the fact that they get the job done in no time. 

However, it is now the second time in less than a month that I have to return shirts that have been stained (last time wasn't so bad and they took it back and cleaned it for free, this time looks like they got some red/purple dye stains all over a brand new shirt - needless to say I'm pissed!).

I also understand no dry cleaner will take responsibility for buttons on shirts etc but since I started using these guys to clean my shirts, I have reached a new record of not even just lost but broken, completely ruined buttons on several expensive shirts.

I'll side with the other review below - if you don't care much about your shirts, feel free to drop yours there, but if you do go somewhere else as you'll be disappointed.
