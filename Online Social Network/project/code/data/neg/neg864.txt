Oh Lordy, yelpers steered me wrong here.

Was out the other night looking for an alternative to Panda, and saw the reviews for this place.

I pulled up, looked inside, and had second thoughts - but yelpers are never wrong, right?  So I motored inside.

First, the place wins no points for ambience. And the lady was a crab.  Second, the egg foo young was so salty, it almost put me in a coma.

The "tangerine chicken" was glopped with this super thick, super sweet sauce.  The other chicken dishes were largely indistinguishable from each other.

All in all, one of the worst meals I'd had in months - 2 stars because the portions are HUGE (as will your gut be after eating here)

Ohhhh, yelpers.... Fool me once...
