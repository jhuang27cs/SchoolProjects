This is the worst bar I have ever been to in the City of Philadelphia. The crowd there was so rude and obnoxious it was as if everyone had this super ego feeling of entitlement. I was constantly getting bumped into, not your average bum, the purposeful I'm going to run into you because I can bum. 

While standing at the bar talking to my boyfriend all of the sudden a bartender comes up and clears my half full drink off the bar, throws it away and walks away before I have a chance to say anything. I understand wanted to clean off the bar especially when it is crowded, but not even asking if I'm finished? REALLY?

Here's the worst part - The bouncer were super rude basically kicking everyone out on their asses and yelling "GO HOME!" I'm sorry but I'm not wasted and I'm adult do not yell at me!

This place doesn't even deserve 1 star!
