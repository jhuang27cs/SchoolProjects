This place is the pits--the rudest people ever!  The little sister, or whoever she is, is so rude when she waits on you, you'll want to walk out.  NONE OF THEM ever say thank you when you pay and are unfriendly--the food itself has gone way down, not that it was all that great to begin with.  Better check and make sure they put cheese on your sub--last two times, they did not on mine.  Is it really worth shorting the customer the cheese to make a few measly bucks.  Even Subway has better food.  I will never give Sottini's another dime.
