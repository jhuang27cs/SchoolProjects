We had a terrible breakfast here not long ago. Like many couples in the city, we love to go out every other week or so for a weekend breakfast. This day, it wasn't busy, and the speed of service was good. The French toast was an abomination. The toast had about a quarter inch of egg white formed around the edges, from poorly mixed batter. Plus the bread was poor quality. The bacon...crunchy fleks of the thinnest, most meager bacon these eyes have seen. The crepe pancakes were ok, but nothing to write home about. Years ago I worked for a grumpy penny pincher who had been swindled into buying a 3 year supply of prepackaged coffee, which just sat in our storeroom for years until we brewed it, and cursed it. Van roots, it was. Pamela's, in all the years I Have visited, has consistently challenged van rooy for the worst coffee crown. On top of all the bad food, last week Pamela's earned that crown. We'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future.
