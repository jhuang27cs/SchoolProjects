For ambiance, this Taco Mac gets 5 stars - it's my favorite location and layout of all of the Taco Macs I've been to.

Food and service was another story, though. I went with two friends of mine for dinner and our waiter was the most awkward, bumbling person I have ever met. He came to our table every .5 seconds, wringing his hands, beads of sweat dripping into my Diet Coke, sputtering: "Um, I-I-I-I'm sorry to intrude, I just wanted to check on everything?" 

I ordered the grilled salmon with veggies (I know, I know - who does that at Taco Mac), and the waiter brings out a colossal heap of cheese fries topped by a dried out square of salmon. I pointed out that the menu says the salmon comes with "sauteed seasonal vegetables", but the waiter said that Taco Mac is "known for the cheese fries! Everyone likes them!", so he substitued the veggies for no extra charge. What a sweetheart!

I told him that I had wanted the veggies, and he came back with a small cup of veggies and a side plate "to put the fish on". I put the dried cube of salmon, which had 3 or 4 soggy cheese fries dangling from the bottom, on the plate. I managed to eat everything by drawing attention to the diverse crowd. The place is always packed, especially weekends or days where there's an event in Piedmont Park. I live in Metropolis so parking isn't an issue for me, and I was really looking forward to having a place downstairs to grab a bite now and then. I still have Vortex, Little Azio, and f20, though, and will stick with Taco Mac for the bar scene or to catch a good sports game on one of their 438526356 screens.
