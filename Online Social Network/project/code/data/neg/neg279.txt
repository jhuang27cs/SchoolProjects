this store bad service, old electronics and used.  every one stay away from EID store don't west your time and money .

my story : This place sucks. I have purchased two laptops from them and have been dissapointed with their customer service. I dont know much about computers but got the impression they were taking advantage of me for my lack of knowledge. 

Part of the mouse pad button on my laptop was not working when I clicked it so I brought the laptop in. Keep in mind I bought the laptop from them just months earlier. I told them I wanted to know how much it was to fix. When I came to pick up the computer, they charged me $80 just to open up the computer and find out what the problem was! They never told me they charged labor just to diagnose the problem. I figured when they told me they would look at it and give me an estimate, that is what they would do. 

I regret ever doing business with this company. I did not know it at the time but there are many other stores/shops out there that have MUCH better rates and give you a much higher quality of customer service
