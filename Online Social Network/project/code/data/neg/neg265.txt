IKEA is horrible.... from a customer service perspective.  After THEY made a mistake ringing up an order for a sofa, they wanted us to walk back up to the sofa department to have them re-enter everything.  They wouldn't budge on this and said it was the only way they would sell us the sofa.  We walked out and I've never been back.  I won't go back.

Other than that experience, they've got some 'neat' stuff, but nothing that really works in a suburb environment.  Trying to furnish your downtown loft or apartment?  You may be in luck ... unless you have to special order something.   Then it's russian roulette.
