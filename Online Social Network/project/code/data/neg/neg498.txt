What happened to this place? Did I just go on a bad night? The antipasto was boring, the Lobster Fra Diavolo was not hot at all, the dessert was congealing. Did I just get a bad waiter? Usually I really like the food here but I don't know, I got a phoning-it-in feeling the last time I went. Maybe I should have had something powerful off their upperwardly-mobile financial-district-esque "martini" menu. I know, now I'm just being mean. But really. Egh.
