Cherlyn B's review is pretty dead on. Me and a friend have tried about 8 different cupcakes places from SD to Murrieta to LA to Newport and I think Sprinkles is on the bottom of my list. Place is way over rated.

EDIT: To be fair, let me add: Not every single cupcake each place offers will be great. This being said, each spot will have it's own cupcake I enjoy... Just have to find that one you like.
