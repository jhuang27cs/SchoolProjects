I brought my 8 year old daughter here for a very simple, straight across the back hair cut.  She sat in the chair for 1 1/2 hours!  I've never seen people in a salon move so slow.  Both my daughter and I were so frustrated when we left.  The cut is ok.  But the time it took to do it was just ridiculous.
