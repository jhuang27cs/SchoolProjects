Very mediocre bubble tea.  If you are a regular partaker of this drink AND you're on the Ave, you're better served hitting one of the other places on the street.  There are tons of bubble tea shops on the Ave.  

I had Thai Tea on ice with bubbles and pudding for about $4 - fairly  watered down taste and barely any pudding.  My home girl had Lavender tea with bubbles and pronounced it "subtle but good", not overpowering. 

They no longer carry froyo - so don't get your heart set on it here.

We came here to check it out, compare to others in the area, and we chose Pochi because it advertised crepes and other snacks.  Don't bother.  Takoyaki and fried tofu (both $3.50) were okay.  The takoyaki was better than the tofu, but it was only 4 pieces.  You could probably squeeze the tofu and get a good amount of oil out of each cube.  We got a bad vibe walking in, and frankly I'm glad we didn't bother with crepes.  If you must - just know they have common Japanese flavours, both sweet and savory, and they are about $5.

The interior was a little scattered, typical of hangouts around college campuses.  I wouldn't bother.
