Maybe I came on an off day, because I don't see why everyone's raving about this place. I know they've been around since 1965, but the doughnut I tried tasted as if it had been sitting there since 1965. Then again, if you're a UCLA student, you probably have the munchies so anything tastes good. If you want a really good doughnut, try Bob's at the Farmer's Market near the Grove.
