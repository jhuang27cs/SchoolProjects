Been here for less than an hour and have nothing too great to say about this hotel. The hotel staff may be friendly, but that doesn't make up for the dirty room and bathroom I walked into. Also, the phone in the bedroom is broken. Not quite the way I wanted start my vacation.  They were unable to accommodate my requested upgrade and I honestly can't wait to look for a new hotel tomorrow.
