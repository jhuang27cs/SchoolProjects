Fro-yo girl here.  This place is like my worst fro-yo nightmare.  I arrived around 5 PM for a fro-yo pick me up and they only had two flavors left, peanut butter and Dutch chocolate.  How did they manage to run out of 8 flavors of fro-yo????  And it was only 5 PM.  They removed the flavor labels from the other machines so I don't know what they had earlier that day.  I guess they can have up to 10 flavors but they seem to always run out.

I'm glad I never went to Cal because the place was a disaster.  It looked like it had been ransacked by wild animals.  They were out of the smaller cups, so they only had the quart size cups left.  The toppings were a mess and there was a huge glob of chocolate fro-yo on the floor that looked like a pile of crap.  I was too horrified to take a picture.  I just want to forget the horrific experience.

And there was still a long line!  They need to raise the prices here (from 30 cents) to 40 cents for public safety.  I gave them one extra star because I don't completely blame Yogurtland.  

This place is disgusting and I might just stick with full serve from now on.  Yogurt Harmony has the best tart fro-yo in Berkeley (with free wi-fi and seating, unlike Yogurtland/Yogurt Hell) and for sweet fro-yo, you can't beat Yogurt Park.  Isn't it worth paying more of quality fro-yo?  I think so.  

You know you love me.  X0 X0, fro-yo girl.
