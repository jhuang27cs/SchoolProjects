Major plus, they have a HUGE menu.  You can get pretty much anything you'd like here.

Other than that I wasn't that impressed.  It seemed a big over priced and my food really wasn't all that great.  And worst of all the staff was rude which will always ruin a good meal.

I don't for see myself making a trip back here anytime soon.  There are plenty of other great places in Westwood I wouldn't waste your time with this place.
