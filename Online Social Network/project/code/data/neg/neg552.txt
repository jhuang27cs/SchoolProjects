Noodle World... Noodle Planet... same thing, potato potahto. 

Feeling like Japanese Ramen? They got it.
Feeling like Korean Ramen? They got it.
Feeling like Pho? Yup. 
Feeling like Pad Thai? They have that too. 
Oh yeah, and they make Oreo boba drinks too. 

Similar to Blue Marlin, this place is trying to do too much and they offer a large variety of below-average dishes. I was overly underwhelmed by the Rare Steak Pho (the broth was super dark and the meat slices weren't thin at all!), the Chicken Pad See Ew (why was there so much sauce?), and the Veggie Pad Thai was really... yellow. 

There's a reason why I haven't come back to Noodle Planet since my freshman year in college... And I don't see myself returning to Noodle World anytime soon.
