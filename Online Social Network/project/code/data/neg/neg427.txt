I was hoping to find a Chinese delivery place near me that actually had real Chinese food.  The search continues, Mu Lan, despite the reviews here does not have anything resembling authentic Chinese.

I ordered a few dishes for the sole purpose of evaluating how close to authentic Chinese food Mu Lan could get.  

- Twice Cooked Pork (a classic Chinese dish, )
- Three Cups Taiwanese Chicken (also a classic dish, )

Also ordered other items, like braised chicken wings, and sauteed string beans. 

Let's just say that I couldn't even tell which dish was which without scrutinizing it, and the dishes I listed above are very distinctive.  The Twice Cooked Pork did not resemble anything like the real thing, and the Three Cups Taiwanese Chicken did not appear to have any of the ingredients you'd expect in that dish.  

On the plus side, I ordered near closing time, they still were able to deliver.  

Looks like I still have to go out to Tasty China for good, authentic Chinese, and keep looking for others to add to the list.
