After reading all the positive reviews and wanting to go to a lounge near my place. I decided to stop by... I loved the decor but the service was the worst service I have experienced at a bar in many years. For starters I could tell if we had to order our drinks at the bar - so we waited but no one was waiting or noticing us. No problem. We ordered cocktails at the bar. Fifteen  to twenty minutes later my date's drink arrived warm though acceptable in flavor. Another 15 minutes later the bartender visited me and asked if I had wanted a beer. I had ordered one of their many cocktails. This was absurd,  I changed my order to a beer to simplify the whole thing and finally got something ! What a headache! I might give this place another try but on a weekday night, I found the service really unacceptably slow. Nice place and I'll revise my review if I have the patience to visit again. They should not have cocktails on their menu if their servers are going to forget what you ordered and ask if you had perhaps wanted a beer.
