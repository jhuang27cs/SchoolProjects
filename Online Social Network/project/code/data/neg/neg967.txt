I have a soft spot for sports bars. I think they can be a lot of fun, especially if you go with a good group to watch a good game. Nothing beats watching an awesome game with a packed bar full of tons of yelling people and a bunch of huge T.V.s. Well, for some people anyway. 

I'm not a huge fan of "B-Dubs". I don't think their food is that great and I don't really like wings so....there it is. My 2 star review, though, is mostly reflective of what happened when I was there for a meeting. I arrived first and was met fairly promptly by the server. I just ordered a water with lemon and it took at least 10 minutes for her to bring it over. The place wasn't even that busy. 

Anyway--it is what it is. If a group of friends invite you to come along, there are worse places you could be. I would never recommend this for dinner, though. Tons of other better places if food is your main concern.
