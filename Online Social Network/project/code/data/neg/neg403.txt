They are known for their chocolate dipped strawberries. They do not seem to be long stem strawberries, but I could be wrong. Either way, they are pretty big strawberries. It's a dollar for one, but five bucks for a little tin tray of them. The tray has about six or seven.

They also have other treats like popcorn, which go for two dollars per carton. Though I have never actually seen them with my own eyes, they also have red velvet cupcakes, but rest assured they do have them. They may also have little cartons and baskets of berries for sale.

I am very happy about another food stand on this street corner, but I don't know about their limited offerings so far. I am looking forward to them expanding their sweet offerings, because I personally cannot see this business being sustainable by just selling overpriced strawberries. One dollar is affordable and people will stop by to buy a strawberry for the novelty of it, but I do not see this as being a routine purchase for those who have already tried it. Please, get more desserts out there soon!
