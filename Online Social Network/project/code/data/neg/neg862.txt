All Thai Food use lots of OIL to make their food taste good when it is hot. However, food turns bad fast when it becomes cold. 
If they use lots of BAD oil, it is really unbearable. Your stomach will tell you how bad the oil is by rushing you to restroom several times. This place is an example and I am concluding based on long time experiences. Sometimes it is OK to stand, sometimes not at all. 
This place should get rid of whatever the cheap oil they are using. It is really unpleasant. If they can use better and less oil, that will be great!
