Confession:  I hate going to the movies.  I hate the overpriced concessions.  I hate people talking nonstop during the movie.  That being said, I usually avoid going altogether, but after seeing all those commercials for The Dark Knight Rises AND THEN hearing it was showing at the Tuttleman IMAX, I just couldn't resist.  

Surprisingly, it was none of those things I listed in my opening statement that made me dislike my experience at this theater.  I was really looking forward to seeing Batman on that HUGE screen...and that's where the problem was.  The screen was so large that the movie almost looked distorted.  The fight scenes were especially hard to follow - I wasn't sure who was beating who (or is it whom?  I didn't receive good grades in English.  Or public speaking.  Whatever.)  And just to make things more uncomfortable, I hated reclining in those seats.  Sure, they're good for the 20 minute movies the Franklin Institute shows but I definitely don't recommend them for an almost three hour movie.

All in all, I was disappointed in the whole experience.  I probably won't be back to this IMAX for another film...at least not another high-action film.

PS - WHAT'S UP WITH THE STALE POPCORN?  I saw it there, popping, fresh-as-can-be, and it was still chewy.  I don't get it!
