If you enjoy management who'd lie to your face, burritos filled with empty padding then I'd recommend this place for you. 

So I got a sausage/potato burrito, ate about 1/4 of it until I realized that it was all rice and no meat. I thought, maybe the good stuff's further down, so I gave my burrito a good lobotomy. No hint of any meat at all. I went to the grouchy looking cashier, who was also the manager of the place and told them that they had forgotten to put any meat in my burrito. I said that it was fine to have meat on the side, since I didn't want them to have to go through the trouble of remaking a burrito for me.

What he did instead was he took my burrito with his dirty hands, and pointed at some unidentifiable speck and said, "Look, meat right there." 

Pretty sure I created a Yelp account just to bitch this place out. Even La Burrita has tastier burritos than this joke of a place.
