Pretty disappointed. 

I live in Chicago and have come to the Boston area a couple of times on business. Seeing as neither Harpoon nor Samuel Adams have a brewpub (why the heck not?) i decided to see what else was out there. On the surface, you'd think that the self proclaimed one of the oldest brewpubs in america would have its game tight by now. Nope...

I ordered fish and chips, as well as two beers (a pale ale and a wit). First of all, the fish and chips was one of the worst i've ever had, which is really sad... how do you mess fish and chips up? Well, the fish was not fresh, or was just a poor cut or variety (it had fish "dark meat" if you know what i mean... the kind of greasy blah part of the flesh). Also, it came in a huge hunk, so it was unevenly cooked. I mean, seriously, I'm from the midwest...we don't get the opportunity to have the freshest of the fresh seafood.... You'd assume that a micro brewery in Cambridge, MA would do it up right.... yet somehow this establishment totally missed the mark. 

The beer was also really boring... not bad exactly, but for a micro brewery... it was below average. Not enough flavor or character to remember it 1 second after a sip...

Obviously, i guess that everyone is allowed a night off or a botched dish, or whatnot, but seriously... based on my one and only experience that I will ever have with this place.... thumbs down... save your money... it sucks.
