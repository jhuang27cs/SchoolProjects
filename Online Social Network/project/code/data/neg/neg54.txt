I would love to have given this crew of funny, engaged staff a good review.  I really, seriously wanted to. 

The trouble was that the truck we got had 171,000 miles on it and you could feel every.  single.  mile. 

There's nothing that can add massive stress to a move more than having a truck that BARELY started.  We were joking about what would happen if it didn't make that last trip to the new place with a truckload of stuff.  

It shook, rattled, rolled, and choked itself back to Cambridge.  I would only use this company if I absolutely HAD to.  Budget is much better.
