This place has seriously gone down over the years.  I used to enjoy grabbing a slice on my way home from work.  However, most times I have frequented this place in the last 6 mths, the pizza has been dry, and not fresh-tasting.  If I have a pizza craving there are much better options and CHEAPER in the area.
