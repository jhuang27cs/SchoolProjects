Well, you've heard it before, the Varsity is a great place to go FOR THE EXPERIENCE. Travel through time by stopping by and stepping into the Varsity. The food? Greasy and not that yummy. Also, it's kind of expensive for what it is. 

Overall, come on by ! for the experience and make sure you grab a hat. Don't expect anything spectacular from the food, my fries were soggy from the grease.
