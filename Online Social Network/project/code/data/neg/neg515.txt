Update: After posting this review, I received an email from a manager at the store who apologized and asked a few follow-up questions and promised to work on the issues.  I was very impressed by this response; unfortunately, I went back several weeks later to try the ice cream again, and they still haven't fixed the freezer problem because the ice cream was freezer burnt & crystallized.  Also tried the fresh mozzarella and it still smelled disgusting.  What a waste.  It's too bad because they have so many good things going for them.
