I was very hopeful as this is in my n'hood. I went for dinner and tried the following: Lychee Martini, basil rolls, potstickers, green curry chicken, and the spicy mixed seafood. 

The Lychee martini tasted like lychee juice with no alcohol.  I usually get a little spark off of one martini...and no sparks :(. We spent $16 for Thai spicy mixed seafood that traditionally comes in a spicy red sauce and we got get a pathetic small portion of seafood in  a "just okay" brown sauce. It was rather disappointing. The chicken green curry (also in a very small bowl) had about 5 small pieces of chicken under a ton of vegetables.  

The food is tasty and not of poor quality by any means, but Spoon is stingy with their portions and meat.  I will seek better Thai elsewhere.
