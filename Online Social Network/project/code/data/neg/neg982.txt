First Brazilian Churrascaria in the Bay Area and I was not very impressed. The place is very nice, clean and the decor is very modern. The meat selection seemed a little lacking, which would have been fine if the meat wasn't so salty. The meat is cooked perfectly, but too heavily seasoned. This is silly because that just makes patrons waste food by getting more than they think they can eat because the saltiness will keep them from eating more.

Not a fan of this place.
