I'm done with this place. They are the rudest people I've ever met, the fact that they are allowed to run a food establishment is more than criminal. And what the f**k is with the sushi chef who watches YouTube videos on his laptop at the same table, every day? He must be bored. Maybe he's bored because service is slow. Maybe service is slow BECAUSE YOU'RE A BUNCH OF F***ING A**HOLES!!

You reap what you sow.

And how people still manage to give this place more than 1 star is BEYOND ME.
