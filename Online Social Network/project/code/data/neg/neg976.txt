I guess the manager of this restaurant doesn't read the reviews on Yelp or business is good enough that they don't care.  A little over priced, food's not bad, I had breakfast and it was decent.  My wife had a bowl of chicken soup, which was good.

Unfortunately the service is not very good.  It takes a long time to get your food and our waitress felt like she was doing us a favor by serving us.  We asked three different people if they could switch the TV monitors to the UCLA/Arizona game but to no avail.  Imagine not having the UCLA game on and you are a restaurant located in Westwood!

With a large varieties eateries available in Westwood, we probably will not make another visit to Jerry's in the near future.
