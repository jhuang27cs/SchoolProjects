We are from Phoenix and were looking forward to Elijah's. It was a big disappointment-the worst deli meal I have ever had. I had the mish mosh soup, chicken soup with a matzo ball and kreplach. No chicken was even close to the tasteless water they served. The matzo ball was also tasteless. Some weird red meat was in the kreplach. The turkey off the bone sandwich was salty and definitely not near a bone.
It is not even close to the restaurant I went to in past years. Here is a suggestion -someone in the kitchen should taste the food they serve.
