So what's the deal with how difficult it is to find simple, plain wood ready-made frames for canvas around here? I guess places are pushing for custom-framing, but for a standard 16x20 inch size, I should be allowed to do this myself. This should be easy.

Once upon a time I worked at the Pearl Paint in northern Jersey, and although it's a job requirement to hate working for Pearl, the store was great. Stocked to the brim, with a huge ready-made frame section. I mean, they had a ready-made frames DEPARTMENT. Really. No lie. Which, to clarify, includes open-front, open-back frames for canvases. Meaning without glass. I clarify this because of the number of places I went where the employees didn't understand what I was looking for. 

I assumed Peal in Central would have a smaller selection, being in a city and therefore, I assumed, being forced to be a smaller store. But they have a HUGE downstairs section.... with empty shelves. I was appalled at the lack of stock. I'm talking everything - paints, brushes, etc. Bare shelves. 

They did have a few frames, but only super extravagant ones in weird sizes for a lot of money. No basics. And they had frame kits in sizes 14 inch and smaller and 27 inch and bigger, but nothing in between. 

Come on, Pearl, this is such a great space, you have such potential! From a former employee who is still willing to shop there, please start stocking your shelves!
