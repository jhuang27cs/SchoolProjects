Expensive - over $100 with tax.  Grungy!  Holey drapes.  Rough thin sheets.  Thin pillows, and don't look under the pillowcase.  Hard mattress.  The blanket should have been thrown away years ago.  Oddly, furniture looked new.  Guests need nice bedding and mattress; cleanliness,   Owners should sleep overnight in a room.   It's a dump.  Stay away!  Choice Hotels should be ashamed.
