What is up with the abrasive attitude?

I went in today to the store for the first time today to make a purchase and the associates who work here do not know how to give good customer service.

The cashier asked for my phone number, which I refused because there was no reason to give private information, and gave me no reason why I had to. After I refused, she was very harsh and basically rang me up without so much a thank you. 

Rude, rude, and rude! Take your businesses elsewhere!
