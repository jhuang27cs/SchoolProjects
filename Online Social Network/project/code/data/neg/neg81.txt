Crappy food? Check.  Overpriced? Check.  Gay slur in the bathroom? Check.  All in all, I'd say we had a very disappointing experience at this restaurant. 

We went with a small group of friends on a Saturday before going to an event.  This restaurant is like TGIFridays, but more expensive.  Our server was nice enough, but everything they served us was greasy.  The salad even tasted fattening - guess it was the enormous amount of dressing and the sugared pecans.  I had a chicken pasta dish that I thought would be light, but it was smothered in oil (and it didn't taste like Olive Oil).  The calamari had no flavor whatsoever.  

Lastly, what really put me over the edge is what happened in the restroom.  Let me first point out that this restaurant is in Midtown, which has its fair share of gay people.   My friend, who looks somewhat obviously gay, accidentally got in the way of some conservative, middle aged suburbanite as she was leaving the restroom.  My friend politely stepped aside and the woman uttered a gay slur about my friend as she passed.  Granted this wasn't the restaurant's problem, but it definitely gives you some indication about what the crowd is like here.  TGIFridays all the way.  

I sure hope we never have to come back!
