I walked into this verizon store, and was impressed at first.  After that, i don't know what to think of these folks.

My phone was broken.  After waiting for a few mins., a young man came out, asked what the problem was, (my phone screen was broken), he took down my name, and i waited for about 20 - 30 mins.  There was only one technician on the floor that was able to help others.

When he finally called my name, i answered, he came over.  but after that? i didn't get a good vibe AT ALL with the clerks.  I am quiet/shy by nature?  and yes, i'm an athlete and a woman of color.  Thus, on a very hot day, i was wearing a sweat shirt.  It did look out of place, but i was comfortable.

When i was being seen at the front desk, the clerks friend kept looking at me and his buddy quite nervously.   Like i was going to bust a cap in someone's as*&s or something?  

I was given a number to call to have the phone replaced.  and that was it. I paid $100 for a replacement phone.

I later found out that i could have had an upgrade of the Droid 2 phone to Droid 4 phone for only $50.

I later called and asked if i could be recompensed due to ignorance on my part, and no voluntary sharing of this information on the clerks part.

I was told: "Well, most customers who want a replacement KNOW that's what they want."

I didn't know that was an option.  I wasn't even told it was an option until much later down the line.  

Thus, i'm giving them a one star, for lack of voluntary information.
