This rating is based on the breakfast alone.  Lunch and dinner are pretty solid, but the breakfast needs a tune-up.  If you're going to be open in the morning, you might as well do it right.  

Breakfast potatoes were dried out and puny...pretty sure they were from the day before.  The eggs and bacon weren't incredibly warm, which I'm not sure how they managed to do since I'm pretty sure they cooked it.  The migas were tasty, but the breakfast burritos were small and really greasy.  They were only $2.50 each, but I still expect a little more in the flavor department.  Kind of expensive overall for breakfast.  Coffee is really good though.  Pancake sandwich is probably the best bet here, pretty delicious, but get the syrup on the side otherwise its going to be drenched.
