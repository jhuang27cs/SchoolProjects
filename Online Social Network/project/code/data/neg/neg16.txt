I'm not sure what everyone else is raving about but I've definitely had better tacos elsewhere.  Their burritos are pretty hefty but no bigger than any other hole-in-the-wall taco joints.  I ordered the carne asada soft taco, which did not come piled with meat like I had hoped.  I did like their condiment bar but other than that, I prob would not come back.
