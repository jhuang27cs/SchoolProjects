The Farmhouse receives way too much credit in the area for no reason.  I've been to the restaurant twice and have had a negative food experience both times.  The atmosphere is extremely poor (red fake-leather booths that I think I've seen at Pizza Hut).  

As for the food, both times I went I ordered a steak "medium rare" and both times it came to me "well done".  How could you be off by so much two times and claim to be a reputable restaurant for steaks!?

My girlfriend got chicken in a lemon sauce with asparagus which was definetly not worth the $4 I could have paid to cook it myself at home.

If you are thinking about going to this restaurant, move along.  I'm seriously never this negative so this review should mean a lot.

Try Bookbinders or The Summit, both in Christiansburg, if you are looking for a great meal!
