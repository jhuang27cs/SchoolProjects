At first glance this place had promise. The interior is straight out of the 1950s because it just never changed, not because it was trying to be quaint. It had reviews about being "best cheap eats," oh how we were lied to.

I ordered the burger, it seemed fitting to the name, and it was pretty good. It tastes like a diner burger but 100x better than a Denny's one for sure. The problem is the price. for $6.75 (add 35 cents for cheese) all you get is the burger, nothing else. If you want fries be careful it's another $3.75 for just fries. The shakes were thick and yummy but at $4.40 a piece not sure it's worth the price. Pie slices were in great variety but again $3.95 a slice with an additional ~$1 for ice cream. What was considered cheap eats cost me almost $20. Don't think I'll be back I can find the same stuff elsewhere for cheaper and better quality.
