Located at University Village, Superior is a convenient stop for USC students - like myself - and locals. The produce and meat prices are dirt cheap. The only problem I have is with the quality of fresh food available. Selected produce can be significantly discounted as compared to Ralph's, but many times I find myself digging through the pile of fruits for one without a bug bite or bruise. It's kind of silly but I feel like I have an advantage since I am tall and can reach the top of produce piles where others have not yet touched. 
There's a wide variety of junk foods and lots of Mexican flavors. However, if you are looking for low-fat or "healthier" snack options, Superior most likely doesn't carry it. During rush hour and certain weekend hours the checkout lines, including self-checkout, can get pretty long.

Many times I got to the produce and i think to myself, "Eek! Methinks not!" But, since it's so cheap, I think, "A-OK." So I arrive at 2-stars :)
