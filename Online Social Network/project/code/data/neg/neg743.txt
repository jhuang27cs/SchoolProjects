I hate reading reviews where you can tell the person is a negative Nancy... I will try to be unbiased here, and give facts.  Wen I read "luxury spa experience", I would never think that is what I received at Amadeus.  I'm racking my brain as to WHY this place is voted the "best of" in Pasadena for years.  Yes, I bought the groupon (5 hr luxury spa experience for $169 + $75 tip) and yes, by now we are all used to businesses getting slammed by groupon sales, and we as consumers have learned to go with the flow.  So the 6 week wait for my appointment didn't phase me.  My Sunday morning rolled around, and off I went.

Easy validated parking next door (they said this was a $10 value, but all-day parking on a Sunday was $5), confusing reception area.  You walk right up to the desk to only get blank stares, then realize the SPA reception desk is behind you.  Odd.  Next I kept noticing how cramped the whole complex felt.  You stand & get a robe & slippers right in the middle of where employees / clients are trying to walk through.  Again, odd.

Locker room for all clients only had 1 working toilet (I assume employees use that toilet too since I saw one coming out). The amenities counter had used brushes w/ hair in them... very unsanitary & unsightly.  The other products out for use seemed also unappealing.  (this was 9 am, so locker room wasn't being used all day... this is how clean it is in the morning)

The complimentary eucalyptus steam room needs to be turned on before you go in, but the bummer was I never used it because I never knew when I had time to go in.  I turned it on & poked my head in for 15 seconds before I left (but I was starving (see below), so no time to relax in there).

The 1st waiting room for the massage is ghetto.  Dirty floor, dirty walls, mismatched dark furniture.  Sad, fake plants, sad dark curtains... no luxury spa here.  At every real luxury spa that I've been to, the water dispensers has ice & either lemon or cucumbers and a healthy SNACK station.  Here, it's just room-temp water from the tap?

-1 hr massage (usually $95) - my masseuse was good.  She was very very young, like straight out of high school then massage school.  So her technique was textbook and strong.

-go wait in the ghetto room for 20 min (although I didn't know how long it was going to be)

- kona loofah glow scrub (usually $85/ 30 min) - I would NEVER ever pay for this here.  they have tiled clinic rooms w/ shower heads coming from the ceiling as you lay on a water pillow (kinda neat).  But loofah scrub was nothing special, kind of hurt, & was 20 min at most.  You are SO much better off going to k-town for a full body salt scrub that lasts an hr for $60 & gets you super smooth. also the tiled room had MILDEW in the cracks. When I saw that I was grossed out. (same person as massage - she was nice & did an OK job)

-wait in ghetto waiting room for a longer time than before FREEZING bc i am wet from scrub & sitting in AC. I SHOULD HAVE SAT IN STEAM RM, RIGHT??!!

- facial/paraffin happens at the same time w/ same person (facial usually $100/ 1 hr, paraffin hand dip usually $20). The esthetician seemed knowledgeable (again young), and she used lots of nice products on me.  first you get a smaller robe to put on, then you have to walk back down to a hallway alcove where you dip your hands in scented paraffin.  then you walk back to your room.  after the facial she peels paraffin & hands are soft.

- go wait at some odd little random table for your 'light lunch' (light lunch usually $20, glass of wine & chocolate usually $12).  i am so hungry now I can't wait to eat my light lunch!  After waiting 15 min at a table in a hallway (everything is in a hallway here w/ dirty walls) a green SIDE salad arrives.  no veggies, no bread or croutons... a leafy SIDE salad valued at $20. right. I scarf it down I am so famished.  I hate white wine but I sip it because I ended up sitting at the hallway table for 40 min.  No chocolate ever made it's way to me either. so sad.  after 40 min of reading ESPN Zone (bc it was the only thing there), I wondered around.  I found another lukewarm water station in a less-ghetto waiting room with a big sofa & a basket that had 3 apples in it!  I ate an apple in about 4 bites to fill my tummy.  then covered myself with a blanket  & shut my eyes on the sofa bc I was obviously still supposed to WAIT for undisclosed amt of time.

- mani pedi (usually $79 - yes that's correct).  Again, nail tech was like 18 yrs old. nothing exciting about it.  no nice leg/hand massage.  go to any run-of-the-mill place, and it's the same. The massage chairs didn't work well, & didn't RECLINE. The foot tubs seemed clean which is important. (side note: i recently went to South Pasadena Beauty Salon on Mission and for $35 you get a mani/pedi w/ 2 people working on you with great long leg/arm massages and a massage chair that reclines in an open, airy atmosphere). 

In closing I will never recommend this 5 hr spa experience.
