The food is comparable to any other Denny's I've been to...but ahh the SMELL.  I can't pinpoint what it is exactly.  Maybe a mixture of Windex and wet carpet?  You smell it right when you walk in.  The furniture and decorations are also really dated.

The only reason why it's not just 1 star is because the service is good and the people working there are friendly.
