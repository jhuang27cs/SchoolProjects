I had finished my Top Dog hotlink and nfactorial was done with her Fat Pizza slice, and it was now time to move our snack train to Sweetheart Cafe! I hadn't had bubble tea in a long while, and D had given some pretty high praise to this place, so my expectations were set pretty high. I wasn't very adventuresome and only got the milk tea boba. The tapioca was good and the drink satisfying, but not memorable. I'll come here again, although I'll probably give the bubble teas from other nearby establishments a try first.
