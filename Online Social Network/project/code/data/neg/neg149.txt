When I went to the will-call booth at the Egyptian Theatre to claim my tickets for "The Loved One"  last Saturday  I was dismayed to find that neither my name, nor the name of the credit card holder, were on the list that Goldstar had provided them. I and my guest were forced to buy tickets at the box office. This was a very stressful situation as the event was sold out- if I had not arrived 45 minutes early we would not have been able to see the film at all. This was the first time I had used their service and I doubt I shall do so again.
