I've strolled by this joint a ton of times, since it's in my work 'hood, but just never bothered to try it until now.    I was mainly looking for some different high-protein eats, so I stopped in seeking the largest burger on their menu.  I ended up ordering  a King Burger with cheese, lettuce and tomato only, no condiments.   

The price was okay, but not very competitive, basically in line with the "premium" burger offerings at the larger fast food burger chains.   Later on, after checking the menu on the fatburger.com website I found that the King Burger had 50 grams of protein - a good amount for a burger, but not as much as the biggest burgers at other  major fast food burger chains.   

Other than the fact that it had lots of protein, this burger was nothing special at all, especially as far as flavor is concerned.  This was actually probably one of the blandest "premium" cheese burgers that I've had from any major fast food burger chain, so I will probably continue to bypass this place in favor of other burger options in the future.
