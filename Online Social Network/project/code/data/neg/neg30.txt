One word: inconsistent.  

Undercooked wings. Decent burritos. Warm beer. Great margaritas. One or two pretty good servers, one or two that have caused me to swear the place off for months at a time (that's my polite response.)

They don't take reservations, no exceptions, no flexibility. They won't seat a party of ten even when nine of you are there and one of them is parking AND ONE OF THEM IS PREGNANT.  Not even if you ask to make a cash deposit. Which leads me to... poor management. 

The manager is apparently also the bartender, or was at some point. I ordered a beer from him, he talked - loudly - with his servers about how he had a fever, thought he had the flu, then proceeded to wipe his nose with his arm, pour me a warm Dos Equis and put it in front of me. THE MANAGER. I used to work for the company that started this business in Pittsburgh, I would have been thrown out on the spot for this type of negligence. 

However two weeks ago I went there for a birthday party on a Sunday, we were the only group there, had a lovely waitress, very accommodating, great food, lots of drinks, excellent bartender. Stellar service. Go figure. 

My advice to Mad Mex: stop profiling everyone that walks in. We aren't all Penn elite. Some of us know how to tip well but we expect cold beer, your wings to be well done and want a waitress that doesn't treat us like garbage.
