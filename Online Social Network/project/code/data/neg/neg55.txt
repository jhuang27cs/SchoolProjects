Went right when they opened and have to say that this was a huge disappointment.

The sushi wasn't that fresh and the pieces waaaay tooo big. Also the rice wasn't marinated - perhaps some of their hot dishes are better, but the sushi definitely not on par with average sushi in USA.

I went together with a friend who recently returned to US after living in Japan and she didn't even bother finishing her sushi menu (she said it just is not edible). I have myself lived in Japan and do have to say this was below my expectations of how poor sushi can get.
