MISSION: to find a good ass slice near Columbia

PROS: convenient location, quick delivery, somewhat satisfies the need for hot and cheesy. 

CONS: Canned mushrooms, too many anchovies, chewy crust, and sauce doesn't have a lot of taste. Had to get a slice at good ol' reliable Joe's Pizza in the E Village to renew my faith 

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?: I'll keep looking.
