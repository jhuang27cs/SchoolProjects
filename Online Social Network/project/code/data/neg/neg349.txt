My fiancee and I e-mailed them about cats we were interested in to be sure she would bring them by at Animal Spirit. We went and we fell in love with another  cat, we filled out an application and it seemed very promising. Mind you we were willing to take her recommendations for food (she is a bit overzealous) and we also agreed that they could check out our living accomodations (again, a bit overzealous, but we figured she must really care). We were told it looked promising and she would get back to us in a few days. After a week we e-mailed and  were told that the cat was having adjustment issues and she would get back to us. Again a few days went by, nothing. So I e-mailed again and got no reply. For a person who comes across as someeone who cares so much, it didn't appear as she was interested in placing the cat or offering us an explanation and perhaps an opportunity to look at some other cats. We ended up adopting two cats from the Ellen Gifford Shelter and had wonderful experience..
