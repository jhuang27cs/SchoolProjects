Absolutely horrible.  The absolute worst.  Words cannot express how horrible this company is and how unfathomable they are a business.  I called for a cab and waited ONE HOUR, and was told every fifteen minutes when I called that, "we don't know what happened to the cab, we will send another."  this happened literally 4 or 5 times.  once they kept me on hold and i called them from another number to check.  Take an ark or crawl, whatever you do do not patronize the worst "cab" company in the world.  I am still not convinced they actually exist, the worst kind of liars, I hope their own mothers get treated this way, sorry bunch of jackasses.
