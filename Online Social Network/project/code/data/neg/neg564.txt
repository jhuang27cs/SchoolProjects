We went for karaoke on Friday night upstairs. We went there and the karaoke guy was awful. He played a club song between each karaoke song even though he had dozens of slips for people who were waiting. We had about 15-20 people and most of them had put in a request while only 3 people go to go in an hour. The book was also very thin compared other places. If you need karaoke, go to Midtown Tavern on Piedmont just south of North Ave. It's smokey, but for quality of karaoke it can't be beat! 

Food and stuff at Midtown was fine.
