I was glad to think of this place on Saturday night when it was freezing out, my group of 4 were starving, and we were already told there was a 45 minute wait at our first choice restaurant. I had eyed Rangzen on my visits to the Cambridge Public Library, and have been very curious what Tibetan food would be like ever since. They seated us after just 5 minutes. Win!

Well, this particular Tibetan food was... OK. Just OK. I'd give it 2.5 stars. For starters, we shared two types of bread. One was plain with just a little butter, and the other, superior, looked more like a wrap - vegetables baked into the crepe-like outside and wrapped around other veggies. As for my entree, I got a beef entree. It was shreded beef and mushrooms over bean noodles with tomatoes and potatoes and garlic. My biggest complaint is that the sauce was just very very thin - it was like an oily/watery tomato sauce. The very thin, small noodles got lost in the mix. I tried my boyfriend's chicken steamed dumplings, and these were alright, but they were very basic, and didn't go that well with the sauce they came with. 

So yeah, that's nice that this restaurant is not too busy for walk-ins on 8:30 on a weekend night, but then again, I may not be going down this side street again except to pick up the latest best sellers.

PS: The other couple I dined with got 2 cups of Poecha tea, the traditional butter tea of the region. I had read about it in Three Cups of Tea, but my friends liked it just as much as the author did - needless to say, they didn't finish it.
