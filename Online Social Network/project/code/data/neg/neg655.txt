They had the nerve to send me to collections after I sent them back numerous "renewal" notices of theirs with "CANCEL" written prominently on them. And I kept getting newspapers, so I kept sending them back their "renewal" notices. It's not that I'm concerned about the collections letter.... for the amount it would never make it to a credit report... but it's the principle of the thing.

They're closed today, but I'll update once I get a hold of somebody there.


** UPDATE 10/02/12: I was busy yesterday so today I attempted to call them at several different times. Each time when I would enter the prompt for subscriber service it would kick me back to the main menu. Finally, it redirected to me to a message that confirmed I had been connect to subscriber services where the call was promptly terminated.  This afternoon at 5:30PM I attempted to call every few minutes with the same results, until finally around 6 PM when I was directed to a message that said the department is closed! Is this the game they're playing?
