i wanted to like this place sooo bad. i ordered the chicken wowshee and put all the crazy toppings in it and was just not impressed. the chicken was almost inedible. it was like fatty? and even the toppings couldn't make it not bland. so disappointed! 

for the amount of food they gave you, it's definitely a bargain. from reading all the amazing reviews, i'm definitely going to go back to try the falafel and maybe steak. but my experience was a letdown. =[ hopefully i'll have more positive things to say soon.
