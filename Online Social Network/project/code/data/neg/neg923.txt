Small rooms with mold. I wanted to like this place...I really did. It boasts agreat location near DKR stadium.  But reality just won't let me give it a higher rating. The staff is clueless. My first room had mold so bad I coulnt stop sneezing. The front desk said they would send keys to a new room "right up". It took almost a hour. Oh yeah the lest part... It runs over 400 a night on sports weekends. Bad rooms+bad service + sky high rates = I'll stay elsewhere next time.
