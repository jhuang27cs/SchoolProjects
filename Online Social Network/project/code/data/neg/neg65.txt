Easily the worst real estate management company in the C-U area, which is pretty impressive.  Their staff is composed of some of the least friendly and unhelpful people you could imagine, their properties, from my experience and based on other Google reviewers, are sub-par, and they will do anything to screw an extra dollar out of you (don't expect your security deposit back).  Don't rent from PPM.

I wish there was a way to give these people a no-star rating.
