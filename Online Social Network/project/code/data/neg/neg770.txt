It's always open and has the basic essentials ... I came here around 1am one night and the place was still pretty crowded.

I find it a little funny, however, how the guy behind the register will literally watch you as you shop ... well more freaky actually =\.

None-the-less, if I'm passing through this side of the area ... then this is a good place to stop at to get what you need.  But for the majority of the time Apple Tree is the place for me!
