Had a pretty terrible burger here, and its pretty hard to fuck up a burger.  Get a burger somewhere else, it's not worth the calories.  It may have been the owner, not sure, but he was a cocky asshole.  I am being generous here and giving two stars because they serve up alcohol and you can drink a six-pack while eating your shitty burger at least.  I will support Campus Bottle for my alcoholic needs.

Update- confirmed, the guy is still a cocky asshole!
