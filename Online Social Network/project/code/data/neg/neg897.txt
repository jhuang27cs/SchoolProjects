I have to say that I had high hopes for this new restaurant; however, overall, the experience I had was very disappointing.  
We ordered the dinner for two:  Mixed Grills - Seafood and Meat "Combination Platter".   The idea was for my friend to eat the seafood while I ate the meat; however, that would not be the case once the entree arrived.  
Overall, it was not a mixed platter.  There was one piece of seafood and the rest was pork, steak, and chicken.  In addition, my friend noted that we did not have the proper utensils for this event. 
We were on a time crunch- trying to get to a movie....I will say that one management was aware of the concerns presented, they made a genuine effort to correct the mistakes.  Additional seafood was brought to the table and the entire meal was comped.
Overall, I think that there are technical issues that have to be resolved for the overall success of this restaurant.  I think it is a promising location and great management staff.  Once the newness wears off and the staff know what they are doing...It will be a fine place to dine.
