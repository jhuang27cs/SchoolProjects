Malbec is just okay and here's why:

It's crazy loud in the restaurant.

We went on a Friday night.  We had made a reservation, which I recommend for a weekend dinner.  We were seated in a timely fashion. 

And then we waited...  
finally our waiter came over to ask us if we wanted a drink.  He was helpful and had good knowledge of the wine by the glass.  When he came back we ordered the Gnocchi and skewered meats and sweet breads.  

Our food arrived.  And then we waited again...

We watched our waiter work the room, talking to all sorts of people and paying special attention to a table full of younger girls, all the while ignoring us.  

The gnocchi was a real let down after reading some of the previous reviews and getting excited for it.  The meat sauce was flavorless and the gnocchi themselves were over-cooked.  Everything was watery.  Completely disappointing.  The meat and sweet breads were okay but nothing special. 

It was a shame that our waiter ignored us because Malbec might have had a chance to redeem itself with another dish but we were never asked how our food was.  As time passed we got more and more frustrated with being ignored.  My girlfriend sat with a whole plate of food barely touched and no one asked what was wrong.  Waiters and the manager all walked past us and said nothing.  The bus boy just took her plate away and didn't ask why she didn't eat any of it. 

Mediocre food and lousy service pretty much sealed the fact that we will not be dinning here ever again.
