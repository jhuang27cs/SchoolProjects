Elysee is a cutesie, girlie coffee/dessert shop that is overpriced with not-so-yummy coffee/desserts.  The place was definitely purty, and the service was decent.  However, the total package was not worth it.  I enjoyed myself there, but it was not because of the venue.  

I was there with a friend on a weeknight.  We got 2 small coffees, one tiramisu, and one strawberry cheesecake.  The total tab was $14.09.  Wow.  The place was filled with UCLA students studying.

Come to Elysee for the nice decor and convenient location.  Don't come here expecting good prices or tasty treats.
