I could very well be biased as I like Hickory Pit by my house, but I was rather disappointed.

Only been here once, but a 1 meat plate with two sides, soda, and an extra slice of bread costed nearly $14. The bread was incredible! But the beans tasted canned (doctored at best), the BBQ sauce was bland, and the cole slaw a was a summer slaw (no mayo). Perhaps I am picky, but I like my coleslaw to be close to a mayonnaise salad. 

Also, I just didn't like the layout of the restaurant. 

Others enjoy it, but it was a total miss to me.
