Um... yeah.  When I first started working in Kendall Square, I was fascinated by this place.  

"Ooh!  There's a food court near my job, and I can go there and get lunch!  This is the greatest thing ever!  They've got Chinese!  And Sbarro!  And a place where I can make my own sandwiches!  Yaaay!"

What this really meant was that I needed to get out more. That accomplished, I now don't have these feelings towards the Food Court.

The options here are interesting.  There's an ABP (but there's a larger one basically across the street), a make your own sandwich place, a Sbarro, a Chinese place, and a teriyaki place that also makes hamburgers.  Really, the teriyaki place is probably the most remarkable of these, because the burger/fries option isn't too bad.

Beyond that, it's a panoply of foods you could either make at home, get over at the MIT Trucks for less, or avoid altogether (that's you, Sbarro).  So, if you like burgers, they aren't terrible, but I wouldn't go out of your way for it.
