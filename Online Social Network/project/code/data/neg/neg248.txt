I am new to this area from the northeast where I had perfectly great hair care. I tried Mina's here first, requested my layers and a brow tint. I left with a stiff bob, having been told the back had to be "evened out" and DARK - ridiculously dark brows that cost $25 even though I was quite seriously upset, and looked scary! But I was polite, so I paid and left, never to return to Mina's. Once my eyebrows faded, I ventured out again, this time to try the Beehive. First, from Meredith, I got layers in chunks, but good advice on how to deal with well water and hair washing. Tried Beehive again 5 weeks later. As I sat waiting and chilling, checking my emails (weekday afternoon= working!) and sending a quick text, I was called to Meredith's chair. I glanced up and said "great, just a minute"...and in seconds she called to me again, with a definite edge to her voice. I was really surprised. I was early and had been waiting for HER. But I was not bothered! And here she was sort of barking? Ok, it was a bit tense as I obediently got into the chair, feeling pretty awkward. Who wants an irritated-angry hairdresser? We talked a bit about the layers, she cut my hair for 10 minutes, and said, "that's it, finished". 
I was surprised, but she said she was trying to correct the previous layers, so that was all there was to do. OK. So I paid and left -  with another bob! - and a terrible feeling that I had been sort of ordered around, had a quick spin in the chair, and was out.
Ugh! Bad.
I have not yet found someone here (Triangle) who can artfully cut subtle layers, and I mean it. I know my hair, I know how great it can look. I am pretty docile and easy going, but this is freaking me out. I will keep trying, but no more Beehive for me, the queen bee is too prickly!
Just heard they are celebrating that she is moving to Seattle or something. So, bye bye!
