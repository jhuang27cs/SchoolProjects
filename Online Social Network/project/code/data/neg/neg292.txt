The bottom line is that Pearl does not know what it wants to be, and does a crappy job at being what it is.  As a craft store (note that the word craft is in the title, so...) it fails miserably.  By trying to supply everything, it is grossly understocked in almost all things, and if you think they might re-order, think again.  I once went in for some mirrors, which I had purchased there before, and was told "No, we don't have those. Frankly, I'm surprised we even have as much stuff as we do." No offer to re-order.  Nothin.  In addition to being understocked, it is also grossly understaffed.  And the people that do work (the word "work" itself is extremely generous) are vapid, lazy, and unhelpful.  Even for basic items (such as white tag board, which they do sell at CVS) you'll usually be disappointed.  Shopping for art supplies should be a delightful experience.  Shopping at Pearl, unfortunately, sucks.
