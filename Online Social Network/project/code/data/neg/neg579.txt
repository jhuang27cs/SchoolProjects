I used to come here regularly, and I know my 1-star review will be insignificant in the grand scheme of things to this business. The last few times I went, the staff was rude and had their hands full. I know restaruants are busy and waiters have it tough. Taking my order seemed to be bothersome to them, not what I ordered rather the fact that they had to stop and take it. I ordered a double cheeseburger with fries and a coke and my husband ordered wafflefries and some chicken sandwich. The waiter actually said "wait you guys are not getting any alcohol?" He was outright dissappointed that we were not going to be boozing it up, and came for dinner. We just though it was weird that we are giving money to this place, often, and they are eager to take your money but with a bad attitude and visibly disappointed staff. I'm not going back, because of the service (not because there was cocaine in your bathroom tsk tsk)
