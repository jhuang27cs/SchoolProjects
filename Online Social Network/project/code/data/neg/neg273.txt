Expectations rise as I enter this store - baked goods to the right, deli straight ahead, and seating in a separate room to the left. Everything looks delicious, the staff looks friendly enough, so to the right I go for my morning baked good. I opt for the chocolate croissant, mainly because counter-girl was obviously losing patience with me while I tried to decide - but they don't have the best display. There should be a sign in the window that says "decide here because you can't peruse inside." Anyway, chocolate croissant: 1) The chocolate was of the melted-and-hardened type. 2) It was not fresh, and in addition to not tasting fresh, it was cool, 3) it was not flaky. The consistency was something between flaky croissant and hostess fruit pie (but it definitely tasted better than the fruit pie). People spoke highly of Black Sheep, so I'll give the deli a try next time I'm in town.
