Suffering the same fate as Magnolia. Bad service. Seems some Austin, Texas locations think they can survive on reputation alone. When it takes over a half hour to get a drink I"m pretty peeved. When it takes them over a half hour to get my credit card back to me I'm upset. When the waiter comments on my zero tip and acts suprised I get pissed. It's simple folks bad service equals no tip. Problem is the only thing consistent about Spider House is the bad service.
