Dinner before a show at the Fox.  Quite a walk by the way.  Be sure you have comfy shoes.  Our server was very good, suggested a great wine that fit our taste.  Other than that nothing was really very good.  My date thought the bread was best and I liked the side of braised greens the best.  The meatballs were good ( an appetizer).  The salad was ok, the pork chops were dry and the sauce and other ingredients with it did not complement each other.  The mushroom pasta was not very good.  We will not be back.  Try 4th and Swift!
