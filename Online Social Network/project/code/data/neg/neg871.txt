The ramen served here is from the 30cent packs you can get at the grocery store, Top Ramen style, no joke.

After realizing we'd have to stand in line for 30min for a piece of sushi at the Yelp event, Sunset Showdown or something (which sucked by the way), we drove to Berkeley for dinner. I'm pretty big on ramen and have tried all the major spots in SF and Peninsula, so naturally I got the kimchi ramen. Boy got the kimchi fried rice with spam. As I sat there, I literally watched as one of the ladies took a cube of dry ramen and put it in a pot of boiling water. Even the flavoring tasted like packaged ramen. At least they added some kimchi, bean sprouts and scallions? Buuut that does not make the $5.20 difference between what we paid and what I could have gotten at the store. The kimchi fried rice was aite but I've definitely had better. 

So...no thanks!
