I have to agree with Rose, this place is horrible. Not only is it dirty and run down looking, but i have yet to encounter a good instructor. They constantly try to give "life lessons" and teach very little about postures. They also blast awful pop and rap music - I don't really feel calm while listening to Shaggy and the Blackeyed Peas. 

But the thing that really got me, and made me write my first yelp review ever was that I was scolded for drinking water in my hot vinyasa class. I was told (in front of everyone) that I was a distraction and that I should have hydrated better before class. This is a dangerous way to run a class, if somone needs to hydrate, they should! No matter what the instructor or others thinks about it. 

If you want to be surrounded by girls in full lululemon gear wearing makeup and perfume to yoga, blasted in the face with pop music and yelled at constantly by yo ur instructor... Go to center for yoga.
