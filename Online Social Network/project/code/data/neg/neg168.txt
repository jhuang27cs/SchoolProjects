I have mixed feelings about this place. I've been in 2x's (more if we count, when it was called Matt's Gourmet Hot Dogs"). The first time there was a nice and presumably thai woman behind the counter. I ordered the cheese quesadilla, and my fiance ordered the veggie dog. I tried his, and it was so-so, exactly what you would get for a couple bucks. The quesadilla was pretty good, I have to say. At least for 3.99 it was. I decided to go again tonight and was a little weirded out that the guy that was ALWAYS working there when it was Matt's Hot Dogs was still working there under the new ownership. I wondered if my experience would not be as good as the last time, because I'm not too sure he gives a damn about the place. I felt bad about coming in at 6:30 because of his behavior towards me. I ordered one of the bowls, and thought it sounded good. MY MISTAKE. The bowl (which was not the chili bowl), was almost entirely chili and raw onions, with a few specks of rice and cheese that was very difficult to stir. I asked him if they were closing and he said an hour, so I tipped him a dollar but man this was just a terrible wast of money. I know I only payed 2.50 for the meal, but I would have rather of gone to pagliacci's and gotten something that I know is going to be good, no matter who is working. Try to go in, if the woman is working, it's not regrettable and won' give you indigestion.
