I am disappointed in Blondies for increasing their prices. I can not believe I had to pay 3.75 for a slice of pizza that was barely larger than what I would order from Domino's. Blondies used to be the place I would go when on Telegraph or Powell Street because it was cheap and there was seating, but now I will have to look elsewhere, the pizza just isn't worth 3.75.
