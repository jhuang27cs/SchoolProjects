I just went to eat here with a friend. We all ordered the lunch special which includes your choose of Noodles and a choice between 2 spring or egg rolls for $7.99. The place was packed, we were able to get the last table. The appetizers, whichever you pick, are finger sized. ...Can't be expecting the whole roll, right? The rice noodles were over cooked, too tender and kept breaking into smaller pieces. The portions don't come close to any other Pho restaurants I've been to either. 

The waitress was super absent minded. First, she forgot my friends Hot Tea. Second, she tried giving us change when we never gave her any money. Third, she gave us food without any napkins and utensils. Forth, we went up to pay and she already thought we paid already. And since we aren't the type to just leave without paying, we reminded her we still hadn't paid. It's obvious she doesn't play attention.

There's so many different places to eat around here that this restaurant can definitely be skipped. 

Also, they recently started charging for parking in their lot. Just $1, but still...just try finding parking on the street.
