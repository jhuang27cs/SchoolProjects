This place prepares a passable burger, granted, at $7.25, it costs more than your average one.  The L.A. burger comes with avocado relish which is good even for non-avocado enthusiasts.  I was pretty disappointed that the place just serves average fare, since T.V. chef Bobby Flay owns the place - he's supposed to be the "king of the grill" and stars in a bunch of shows on the Food Network which should say something about his grilling chops.  The sauces are probably better than what you can get in those awful squirt packages of ketchup that you see at a cafeteria or at Mickey D's.

I heard from a friend that her burger was undercooked and bloody even after she'd sent it back to be regrilled.  I haven't had a bad experience per se, just a string of underwhelming ones.  Why do I still go here?  The simple answer is, the food is edible, and that is more than what can be said about some other places.  If you're going to order a burger and they ask you how you want it done, always remember to say, "Well done."  

If you just want to satisfy your sweet tooth, order a shake, though I'm not sure you can stomach the $5.00 that one costs.  I had the blueberry-pomegranate one and it was pretty good.  I'm assuming that the recipe calls for using real fruit in the strawberry and blueberry shakes.

A note about the service: the storepeople try to make you feel "at home" by setting down a knife and a napkin at your table before your food comes, smiling obsequiously at you and welcoming you with a "Welcome to Bobby's Burger, how ya doing today?" but make sure they don't rush to clean stuff out of your way while you may be conversing with someone and still working on your food.
