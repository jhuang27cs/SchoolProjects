Staff friendly and accommodating, but two mistakes made with our order. We ate a side as a dessert because they forgot it, yet still brought it just before the check. A bit expensive, even for a Palo Alto, esp since in a strip mall across from the high school.  Quality of ingredients high, but preparation fair to poor: wood fired pizza wasn't crispy enough, tagliatelle with greens and lemon was drenched in lemon juice, pasta was very tough, and the escarole strangely tasted like brussel sprouts.  Medium well burger, $13, was charred, about 1/3 inedible.
