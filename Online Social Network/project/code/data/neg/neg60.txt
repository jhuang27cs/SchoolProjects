Held my Company holiday party here and it was a complete disaster after having a mtg with the manager and discussing menu and much planning on my side.
They had the menu wrong, the Karaoke guy never showed up and some kid tried to dj in its place and they never told me another party had our place starting at 10pm.
We were descended upon by another party who ate our food and were so rude.

Don't recommend for private parties.  They say you can't hear the band upstairs in the Crimson lounge but they was SO not true.
