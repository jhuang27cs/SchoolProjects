This is my last resort for burritos. When I stayed in Nebraska, this is what kept me sane. Chipotle has the resources to bring burritos and tacos to communities that probably wouldn't have them otherwise, but living in LA there is really no excuse to ever here with taco trucks on almost every corner. But they did have 2 for 1 burritos for UCLA bruins and that at least gives them 2 stars, otherwise it's too expensive for a burrito that is...meh.
