This review is strictly for the manicurist hired by Adolf Biecker.  I love their haircuts, but when I got a manicure and pedicure I was appalled.  I am a highly forgiving person when it comes to mani pedi's, but this one was insulting.  The quality of the nail polish was very weak (streaky, uneven, thin despite 3 coats) and I had to ask to get the dirt taken out from under my nails.  Even still, I asked if I could give it a go myself since none of the dirt was removed and it was still visible through the polish (and I don't have especially dirty nails, I promise).  

I am writing this review to advise people not to make the same mistake I did.  I felt so ripped off and shocked that Adolf Biecker would hire someone whose commitment to quality was nonexistent.
