the donuts here aren't anything real special. to me, they are too heavy and not real good. they are a bit too dense and sweet for me. but to my mom and dad, this was a place full of fond memories for them. for me, i'm not so fond of 'em. they're aiight but nothing to drool over. it was a pleasant experience though.
