I used to eat at the trucks b/c they're cheap.  but then I started to feel ill and stopped eating here.  I do want to try the vegan truck when they return  But overall I tend to avoid these trucks due to my sensitive stomach.

i usually ordered the falafel sandwich from the jerusalem cafe truck - it was okay but the lettuce and tomatoes did not taste very fresh and i think that is what made me feel ill.
