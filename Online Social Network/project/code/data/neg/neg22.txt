Just your average Panera - typical chain food, good service, whatever. 

Unfortunately the only time I would usually come to a chain like this is when I want a comfortable place to study, and not only is this particular Panera usually packed, but the internet is always awful. It's not just the 30-minute sign-off thing someone else mentioned - the connection is horrible and even completely unusable in some areas of the restaurant.
