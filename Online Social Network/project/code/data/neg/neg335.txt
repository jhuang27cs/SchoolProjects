If I could give negative stars I would. 

Order #1 for delivery...Never got it.  After calling the restaurant the owner kept saying 5 minutes.  Never did receive the order

Order #2 for delivery...WRONG ORDER!  I had a craving and decided to give them another chance.  After waiting 1 hour I called and got my food about 10 minutes later.  The only problem was that it was NOT my food!  

I believe I'm done with them.  Back to Chopstix I go.

UPDATE: Owner called me 2 1/2 hours after my order and says that before refunding my money they are going to come and pick up the food!  1) I did NOT eat the food 2) I put it in my trash can 3)They want to make sure that they get everything back before refunding.   

Then she tried to tell me that I owe $12 more.  For what?  So I can have my initial order recooked.  LOL  Sorry guys, but I ate dinner an hour ago.  

So they are on their way to pick up the food that I did not touch and put in the trash can, so they can reimburse me.  Interesting business strategy.
