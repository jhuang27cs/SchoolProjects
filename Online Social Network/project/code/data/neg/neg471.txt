I am sorry to say I did not have a good experience with price is right. They were initially responsive and return my phone calls quickly to set up a time. However they were very expensive for a relatively simple job. My leak was bad so I went with it. 

I left my husband home while Troy worked and when it was finished I came home to find the tub spout more than a 1/4 inch away from the tile wall and a deep scratch in the tub underneath it. I could put my pinky finger between the wall and spout and see the pipe. It was about 5:40 when I called and asked them to come fix it, the man said he would have Troy come back tonight and fix the problem. Troy called and asked if he could do it another day, when we said we would rather it be tonight....he finally showed up at 9:40pm after we called him again at 7:30 to see if he was still coming.

He tried to "fix" it by cutting the pipe which made the whole thing not work and leak water out the back. then he informed us the problem was the spout he bought uses a screw at the bottom, it is not the threaded kind like the original. Well... He bought the thing, installed it and then left with our money like it was done correctly. And now he is telling us it is the wrong faucet. Needless to say he had to come back the next day with the right part. And to top it all of he left a mess of plumbing grease dripping down the tub underneath the faucet.

So after my very long story, they did bad work and it was very obvious they didn't care about doing a good job, putting the right parts on or about fixing their work.

I would not use them again.
