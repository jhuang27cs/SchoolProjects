I'm really not sure why people come here. Yes, I will admit the decor allows you a temporary escape of living in the midwest, but, that really the only thing going for it. I believe the quality of fish is extremely poor, over priced, and simply, not tasty. I have been there multiple times only to ask myself why? 

The only reason why I guess I decided to give it two stars instead of one is the service and drinks. Only saving grace.
