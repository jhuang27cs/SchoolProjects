I walked in there about 30 minutes ago and ran for the hills. The Ragazzi is slowly dimming and it's sad to see a once, amazing and inviting coffee shop, fade into extinction. This place needs to be saved by the coffee gods. The display cases were lined with cheese its and old cookies. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm sure cheese crackers do not compliment coffee all that well. This place used to be alive and vibrant with some of the best coffee drinks and most amazing salads and sandwiches. Small bands would play on Friday nights and laughter would fill the air. During finals week the Ragazzi would stay open late nights to accommodate students with soft tunes to ease their stress. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, students would bring in their parents to eat some of most delicious breakfast croissants to match their hot coffee. I miss what The Ragazzi used to bring to the table. I hope some kind soul would come in and turn the place around. Well...here goes wishing,
