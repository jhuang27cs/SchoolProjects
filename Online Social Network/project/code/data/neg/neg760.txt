I don't really enjoy Central Square, I like that it is close to Boston -- but that is about it.  I'd never want to live here.  I get freaked out by the crazy people that live on Mass Ave (literally live on the street).  Not trying to sound mean, but they scare me.  I've been stared at, propositioned and I just get a dirty feel from this place.  I do like Enormous Room which is in Central, but other than that, Central is not for me.
