I love going to micro brewery's but never have been treated so snobbishly, was seated in the far back away from any other patrons that might see us. the table was so uneven we almost spilled our very expensive beer.  the food was good the beer was good, the staff and ambiance was atrocious. we left after the first round of beers and went to bagger daves. that place is truly awesome.
