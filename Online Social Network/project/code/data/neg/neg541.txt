Very low quality.  Being Japanese owned I expected more.  I got the Matsuri Chirashi.  Before I dipped in, I already saw that it was a old fish.  This almost seemed like that it's been sitting there for about 1 and a half weeks.  Spicy tuna in Chirashi seemed really odd to me.  The rice was totally under cooked with hurikake topping (don't know why they'd use this).  The egg had a tint of gray color to it.  For the price there was very little fish. If you like Tuna... the tuna seemed like it was from Ralph.  It had a lighter red tint in the fish as oppose to a shiny red tint.  It almost seemed like it's been sitting in water for a while.  

My friend got the salad and you can tell that the salad has been swimming in the dressing and the fish looked old.  I felt bad because I got my friends excited about this place.   

Being Japanese, this place was disappointing.  I cannot support this place.  Please save your money.   Service was decent.   I honestly don't understand how this place has a high rating.  Oh wait probably because Gaijin =) Enjoy this place at your own risk.  I was really disappointed. Oh wait...their miso soup was pretty good.
