I'm pretty sure the ONLY redeeming thing about this restaurant is that it is open until 3am, so when the bars In Central/Kendall close at 2am and you are drunk and you are CRAVING some good greasy deliciousness, at least this place is open. But you're only going to satisfy the greasy, not the good or the deliciousness. Not only is the pizza greasy, it's actually kind of bad. At least it's fairy cheap for a fairly large slice. But I seriously will only frequent this establishment between 2 and 3 in the wee hours of the morning. DAMN KELLY's ROAST BEEF CLOSING AT 2AM AND MAKING ME COME HERE! GRRR!
