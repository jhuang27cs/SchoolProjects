The staff was so apathetic!  We sat at the bar, there was hardly anyone there. So no reason for the attitude we were getting.

The oysters were good, the squid was grilled to long and rubbery.  The dink menu, was ok.  We live in the neighborhood and walked over, I will rethink long and hard before returning.  I know they have only been open a month or so..let's hope they can get the waitstaff a bit of customer service training, considering all the other choices on the Westside to chose from
