Part 1 (Friday) of 2: Vegetarian gets meat put in a veggie dish 

For someone who's only been a vegetarian for about 4 months, I hadn't experienced a mess up until recently. I ordered the 5 bean veggie chili which to me was a total steal since it came with a mighty fine salad as well, all for under $6. I know this place has been here forever, and I was all about giving it a try finally. Parking was easy, no wait, cheap beers. My chili comes out and I was impressed there was squash and potatoes in it. However, this where the good ends. A couple bites in, I found myself chewing some SAUSAGE, which I spit out. If I wanted to eat meat, I would have ordered meat. But I don't want to. I said nothing at first to my meat eating companions. I eventually open up and let them know I was upset there was sausage in my veggie chili. I contemplate saying nothing to the waiter. But even if there was only one little piece of sausage in the whole bowl, it still ruined my meal for me and I just couldn't eat anymore of it. So I order a side of potato salad. And come to the decision that I was not paying for meat being my supposed veggie chili. The whole ordeal made me feel diva-like when I'm normally very easy to please when eating out. 

Sure, they were apologetic. And comped my meal. But I still didn't get to eat a real dinner. The potato salad sucked as well and I doubt I'll be back. This sort of crap doesn't ever happen to me. RARR.
