In all of my yelp days, only two restaurants have ever been deserving of a 1-star review. Well, last Thursday I discovered a third. Perhaps TFB is better known for their lunch menu? their bakery? the atmosphere? I all know is this patron (points to myself) won't be back for dinner again. 

I ordered the pappardelle, porcini & shiitake mushrooms which came with a hefty price tag of $16. $15.99 of that must have gone towards the interior design of the place because the flavor of the dish wasn't worth more than a cent. The pappardelle noodles seemed like they had been cooked days ago and popped in the microwave to reheat for a wee bit too long -- the texture was no where near the chewy al dente I'm accustomed to. What are they thinking serving TV dinner quality meals for fresh authentic Italian food prices? 

You've been warned, yelpers! Save your money. Take it across the street to Miltos and pick up a nice pizza for half the price.
