O.K. this place has pretty good food if it's 4am and you're really hungry and maybe a little drunk and stoned.  


That being said, if you're sober, and you are going to grab lunch there, don't bother.  The service is invariably terrible.  There is sometimes a terrible odor in the restaurant because they don't change the mop water enough, and you will be dining with the 20 or so flies that frequent the restaurant. 

If you must eat here, don't order anything beyond breakfast.  This is where kerbey lane shines the most, but even then it's not outstanding.  

I say this a lot in my reviews, but this is just another over-hyped austin restaurant that sucks.
