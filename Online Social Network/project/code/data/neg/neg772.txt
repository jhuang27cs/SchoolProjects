I had a negative experience with Dr. Woo, who was the doctor who was on call when I had my baby.  She didn't end up delivering the baby, but she was very cold, was unable to respond to our questions, and was a very alarmist doctor who set a very fearful tone for my delivery.  

I had had one prenatal visit with her since I wanted to meet all the doctors in the OB-GYN practice at PAMF (since you never know who will be your doctor during delivery) and I left that appointment hoping that she *wouldn't* be on call when I went into labor since she was very curt during the appointment and not interested in meeting/talking to me at all.
