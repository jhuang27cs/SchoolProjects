I haven't been to ZuZu in about 5 years and my memory was that the food was good. Went for dinner before a show last night and had the worst meal I've ever had. I had the pork loin, two dry, tough, tasteless hockey pucks over green beans and amazingly flavorless bacon, served with mashed potatoes that should have been left in the paste can. The presentation looked like an angry three-year-old had hurled the stuff on the plate. I'm sure I'll be back for drinks and music, but never again to eat. Wow.
