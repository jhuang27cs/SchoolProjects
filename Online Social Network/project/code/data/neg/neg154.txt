2 days ago I purchased a dining room table from the Palo Alto location, I have a question today about my purchase and I have been on hold for over 15 minutes to speak to Tish the sales person who sold me the furniture.  I got a much better response the last few days leading up to my purchase before they had my credit card. 
My recommendation:  You have a one time shot to get all of your questions answered and that is BEFORE they get your credit card number and they're commission.
