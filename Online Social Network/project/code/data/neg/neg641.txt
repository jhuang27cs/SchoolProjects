I went in during the summer with a friend of mine who really enjoys this place. It didn't take us long to order, but we found out it would take about 20 minutes for the order to be completed. The girl said she was the only person as a cashier and the only person making the sandwiches. With that that said, we both decided to tip her a little more generously, and sat down with a drink. I believe it was only a little over $5 for a canned drink, a vietnamese spring roll, and the sandwich. Pretty cheap prices, especially around the UT area. 

We waited, and waited, and waited. We waited so long that my 1.5 hour in between my two classes ended up with me running to class (5 min left!) with my sandwich and spring roll in tow. I finished my drink about 45 minutes ago. I had ordered something that seemed a bit exotic and I wasn't exactly sure how it would taste. First few bites were good. Upon then did I notice that there were carrots, cilantro, and spicy peppers/jalapenos in my sandwich. Neither of these I like in any sandwich. On the menu, there was no sign saying what the staple vegetables were going to be in the sandwich, but I suppose I should have asked. I hesitated because the line behind me was so long, and I didn't want to be one of THOSE people. 

I tried to finish my sandwich, but it was too spicy. I could take the cilantro and carrots, but the peppers make my eyes so teary. When I tried to eat the spring roll, it was so limp and tasteless that I had to throw it all away as well. 


All in all, not a great first experience here, and if they keep only one girl doing all the work, it's not likely I'll be back.
