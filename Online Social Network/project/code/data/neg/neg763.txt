"what are you talking about? someone put their heart and soul into making this dish"

"are you freaking kidding me? i'm going to throw up, i swear watch me! (start to gag)"

"of course, you know someone had to go to the los angeles animal shelter and pick up that animal."

"omg hahaha, and skin it, burn the fur off, stew it to remove the smell. that's why the meat in your pho as dark grey mold color and look your basil is wilting. i can't believe you brought me here! this place is terrible. $8 bucks for my vietnamese salad?! $8 for your moldly pho?"
