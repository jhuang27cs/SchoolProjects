The last two reviews on this page 100% encapsulate this business. I just spent 30min waiting for food, only to have one of the waitstaff come and tell me that my food would be ready in another 5 min or so... She promptly came back and told me it was going to be closer to 15min... After I had already been there for over half an hour?!?!?!? I demanded my $10 back, and got it, minus the $2 tip they had already taken out of the tip jar I left them... I work just down the street form this business and I can guarantee you I'll never recommend it to any friends/customers of mine~
