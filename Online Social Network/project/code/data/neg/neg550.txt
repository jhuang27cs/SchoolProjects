Ok the food might be good, but the service is "meh" and that's why I give this place 2 stars. I know it's always busy (or ok I only go at busy times), but there are plenty places which endeavor to be at least moderately friendly even while it's crazy busy. 

Finding a table is about equivalent to finding parking in the area - terrible.

But if you really want to hang out, eating in always has more food than a take out box does.
