Welcome to the U District another mediocre Thai restaurant. Their ingredients seem to be quite fresh, so it's a shame that they can't cook. Too sweet and too fishy like every other Thai place. Why can nobody around here besides Thai Tom make decent Thai food (of course, that comes with cockroaches in your food)?
