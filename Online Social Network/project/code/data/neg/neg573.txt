I came here to get a fairly ubiquitous Hofstadter book and it seemed a bit overpriced for a used paperback with weakened bindings.

I went the extra block and checked Twice Sold Tales, sure enough it was a couple of bucks cheaper, and in better condition.

Maybe this place is better for harder-to-find texts, but Twice Sold Tales remains my Ave bookstore of choice.
