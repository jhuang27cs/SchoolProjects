I have heard some good things about Texas Chili Parlor, but I guess I finally decided to make my trip out here a few years too late. Seems like many people are saying that it used to be better. I really hope so...

I'm on a mini quest to find the spiciest dishes in Austin, so when I started reading about the XXX Chili here, I had to try it. I ordered a combo...taster bowl of XXX, enchilada and tamale...figured if the chili really was that crazy hot I'd at least have some options to settle my taste buds. Turned out to be very unnecessary. I don't know if the chili cook was having a bad day or if they served up the wrong level of heat, but this was definitely not what I was expecting. I ate the small bowl pretty much straight through with just a slight feeling of "yeah, this has a little bit of kick" but it was disappointing. The taste of the chili itself wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't something I'd head back there for. I make better at home. 

For the other parts of my meal I'd say that the tamale was fat and flavorful, though a good bit on the dry side. The enchilada was tasty, but if you can mess up cheese rolled in a corn tortilla then you've got serious issues. My friend who had joined me for lunch had a strip steak and it looked adequate and he basically described its taste the same way...not that great but passable. 

If I were to start ranking the spiciness of the dishes I've sampled, I would definitely put the XXX Chili at a 1 out of 5...nowhere near the hottest thing I've eaten. I was really excited to try it, but disappointed after. I have to assume that it must have been hotter and tastier a few years back...
