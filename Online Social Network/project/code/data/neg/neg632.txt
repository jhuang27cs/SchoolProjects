Have been here before and it is delicious but...Second time this week trying to get a kabob wrap. the first time I went they said they ran out of kabob.Today I go in at 3:40pm and they ran out of kabob again with no mention if they were going to make more. Are you not a business? Do you not want my money?Please remove items you cannot provide to your customers. It's like a pizza parlor that runs out of pizza. Absolutely ridiculous!!!
