Hmm, it's really puzzling to me that this place has an average of 4 stars. I recently moved to Claremont and have been exploring my new neighborhood, and I just returned from my first trip to Pollos Kikiryki. To give a bit of background, I love food and tend to give most restaurants 4 stars. This place really disappointed me.

I ordered the half rotisserie chicken and 1 side, and chose the salad as my side. The chicken was tasty, but honestly was not any better than the grocery store deli rotisserie chickens. In fact, the skin seem particularly fatty underneath, and there were several spots where the skin and meat were overcooked to a dry stringy mess. The meat did not "fall off the bone," as some reviewers have said. The green sauce was also tasty, but actually rather bland, and did not compensate for the overall mediocre flavor of the chicken. The salad was literally several piece of iceberg lettuce, a couple slices of tomato and cucumber, and what tasted like Wishbone bottled Italian dressing. I ate in the restaurant, and when I asked for tortillas, I was told that it would be 75 cents for two tortillas.

The run-down looking restaurant has zero ambience, with old plastic booths, and the food was served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. The service, while cordial enough, was not particularly friendly or enthusiastic. I'm no cheapskate, and will gladly pay good money for delicious food or a nice ambience; but for the quality of food that I got, and the rather depressing feel of the place, I did not think the experience was at all worth the $8.50 I spent there.

I hate to give negative reviews, especially to small businesses, but I felt I had to add my honest 2 cents to all the oddly positive reviews listed here. I can't understand why anyone would call this place a hidden gem by any stretch of the imagination. I will very likely not be back, as there are many better options in Claremont.
