ok... WTF happened to this place... this was my go-to place for a long long time.  I've been in Cambridge since September of 2007 and when i first came here.. wow the food was awesome!  They use to fill the wraps with lots of meat ( if you get a chicken or lamb roll-up).  It seems like this place got new ownership and they are sacrificing quality.  The old Falafel palace would take their time pressing the rolls until they are crispy... Now the rolls are pressed WITH the aluminum on.  They only leave the rolls on the presser for mere seconds.  What you are left with is a floppy, cold roll that falls apart.  Speaking of falling apart.. they now leave the top and bottom ends of the roll OPEN.  EVERYTHING falls out! wtf are they thinking.  And what is the deal with the greens they are putting in the rolls... first, they tried to use "high-class" salad type of greens in the roll.  I think they realized that cost too much money and now they put in lettuce..  wtf.. just keep it original.. more meat.. less greens.  Before these new people started working at Falafel it used to be meat/falafel, pickles some tomatoes and few, few greens.  They USED to give a hot crispy roll that was much larger in size.  I keep getting angry thinking about the change in food.  I dont even want to talk about the quality of the chicken, lamb and plates.  Do not go to Falafel palace... this place went from A+ to Z-
