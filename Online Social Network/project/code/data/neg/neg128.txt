Disappointed!  Arrogant manager!  Smokers huddle at the front door. No matter how good the food, overshadowed by smoke and a rushed arrogant staff!  "Can't order appetizer before food order, it confuses the cooks"!!??  WFT??  Oh yeah, the awning and patio dining is in shambles.
Pasadena's worse Italian restaurant.
