Food was ok, not great. Chicken Teriyaki was the best of the selections we got. Tuna sushi was a bit tough. Rolls were messy. They also took nearly 35 minutes to prepare a takeout order, after telling us to come in 20, and the order was missing the miso soup and one of the rolls, which I realized when I got home. Overall, not a great experience.
