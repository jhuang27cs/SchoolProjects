I am a long time customer at the Red Light and have seen generations and generations of snotty sales people pass through. I think it is part of the allure of working there - as if vintage clothing and ironic t-shirts (yes, I remember Clarissa Explains It All) are anything to be snotty about.

Sometimes they have a good selection of vintage clothing. Every once in a while I will find a gem of a dress, but it is usually after sorting through clothing bought out of ironic desperation by the too-cool-for-school (literally) elite buying team. And after all that sorting anything that I am interested in purchasing is often way over priced.

The Red Light is "very cool". If you're into that sort of thing. But most of what they sell is a reproduction of a lifestyle that cannot be purchased, only half-assed. If you want cowboy boots consider going on a thrift store tour of Montana where cowboy boots (and hats and all other cowboy accoutrement) can be found in overwhelming abundance. I am not opposed to a nice vintage dress, a pair of well preserved shoes or anything that blends in with my wardrobe and doesn't require complete vintage consistency to work. But enough with the painful flashbacks. We all remember whatever 80's/90's brand or slogan and I, for one, don't particularly care for all the reminiscing.

Let's move on, folks.
