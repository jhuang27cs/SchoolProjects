I went here for a date-night with my boyfriend. It wasn't the worst night out I've ever had but we left completely unimpressed. 

The decor is nice and the menu sounded good when we looked it over online in advance....

SERVICE:

Overall, the service was polite but VERY SLOW... I have served before and I know when a table is forgotten about v. when a server is just busy... We were forgotten. No apology was made for our long wait to order (we got an app first and it came, we finished it, plate cleared and we had empty waters before someone---not our server---came to take an entree order). He just said "I had technical difficulties so I had to send (the other server) out to take your order.

FOOD: 

The app we ordered, calamari, was great!

The entrees were not.... 

We ordered and shared the sea scallop dish (with mashed potatoes, wasabi beurre blanc) and the lobster ravioli (which was on special).  The ravioli was just plain bad...or mediocre if I'm being kind. It was ground lobster meat over-cooked and the dish was under-sauced. It had a fishy taste---worst seafood I've had on the west coast just about. My boyfriend swears he's had a better version of the dish at Olive Garden. 

The scallop dish was better executed---not over-cooked (by much) and a nice presentation but the choice to put wasabi and a pineapple salsa on the plate was just confused...I was trying to be adventurous even though it sounded off-putting, but it turned out to be the worst kind of "fusion" cuisine---random ingredients thrown together to sounds interesting, with no heed paid to how they taste.  The food wasn't even salted properly...neither dish was worth it's price tag at over $20 a piece.  

We were very disappointed.
