Meh - somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. 

The two rooms are very nice: lot of space between tables, nice distribution of the tables in the rooms, pleasant, warm colors.

The food is, sadly, quite bland, way too bland for the price. The spicy squids (~$14) were not very tasty, but they were very chewy: Good work out for your jaws. The sauce was fairly generic, not very spicy (2 stars). The bibim bap (~16) is perfectly eatable (that's the 3 stars), but that dish is more comfort food than anything else. Surely not worth the price.

Question: why is it that Squirrel Hill does not have any high-end restaurant, but tons of mediocre (although not always horrible) places?
