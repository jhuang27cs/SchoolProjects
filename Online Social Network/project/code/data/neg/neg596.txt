I got take-out. I was tired that day, and just didn't want to tolerate the hot, small restaurant - rather preferring to have a dish I normally like at home, in peace. 
Well, I have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER why everyone and their mother loves this place. Am I missing something? There are a thousand other Thai places in Seattle that are better than this. The food wasn't good at all. I got sweet and sour chicken, which was overcooked - and the sauce wasn't at all sweet and sour - just something resembling it. I thought it was maybe just orange colored oil??? It had some saggy veggies there too. 
Besides the terrible food: the service was pretty awful. There is no place to sit down to wait for the take-out - so you have to hang out on the street (and it wasn't that fast, so the wait was substantial). It's CASH only, remember. So I trekked to the nearby B of A, and when I brought cash back and paid... then I was asked to pay again by another waitress. They appeared confused about who had already paid and who hasn't, while waiting for take-out. Granted, I didn't have to pay twice but... they seemed completely put out by having to serve people (the nerve of customers to desire something!), and basically were unpleasant to interact with. 
I looked around while I waited for food. The place is the smallest hole in the wall I'd ever seen, and completely full - and it seems you have to wait for freaking ever to get seated. 
Again... why why why suffer for this overrated food?? You can just go literally two steps down the block to find another Thai place that I'm sure doesn't treat their customers like bodies to be served and thrown out as soon as they finished eating. I'm never coming back.
