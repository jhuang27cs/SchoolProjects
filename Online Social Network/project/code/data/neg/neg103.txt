Eh, just ok. My friend and I came here for the first time a few weeks ago, and us being Indian food lovers, we had high hopes. The atmosphere was good, and it was relatively quiet for lunch. The buffet was on the smaller side, and the food was warm, not hot. The tikka masala and the naan was probably the best there, but I was looking forward to a SPICY tikka masala, but this was very mild. Overall, definitely a 2- star, maximum 2.5 place.
