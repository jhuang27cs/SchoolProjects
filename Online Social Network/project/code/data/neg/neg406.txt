-1 The chicken tasted bad.  
-1 The noodles were over cooked.
-1 The soup was so so very bland.
-1 Too expensive for the crap food they server.
+1 The service was passable.  But they close way too early for a college town too.  9PM in the summer, come on, i never eat before 9 when the sun is up till 8.  (1/2 mile from College Park)

The Noodle Company in downtown college park has better food, bigger portions, and lower prices.
