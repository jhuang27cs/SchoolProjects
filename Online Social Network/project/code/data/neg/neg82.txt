Came here for takeout because I didn't feel like cooking. I've eaten in before, but this time I ordered online, which I'm usually all about because you can double check what you're ordering without going "huh?" 1000 times over the phone. I ordered a bacon burger and paid extra for cheddar cheese instead of American because American cheese is freaking gross. A few minutes later, I picked up my order, brought it home, and was seriously disappointed to find basically liquid American cheese on it. Not to mention that the burger was flopped together and overcooked. Fortunately, the fries were delicious.
