I was wavering between 2 and 3 stars on this one. 

There were a few good things about CC. Good location, good local vibe and they take reservations. The persimmon pudding was the highlight of the off-kilter meal- very "fall"-ish, creamy, and yum.

Unfortunately the bad definitely outweighed the good: First off, incredibly cramped and loud.  

I ordered their shrimp and grits, supposedly their "signature" dish and it was just mediocre. Granted, good amount of shrimp, mushrooms, and bacon topping, but there must have been like 2 tablespoons of grits on my plate. Where was the rest of it? I would have expected more from a $20 signature dish. 

My fellow diners had the tuna dish which actually looked pretty "bleh" (she said it tasted ok), and two others had hamburgers, neither of which liked it at all. Someone had the house side salad which was literally just lettuce. The bread they bring before dinner was perhaps the most pathetic excuse for a loaf I've ever seen. And the 2.95 side of grilled okra that I ordered had exactly 6 pieces of okra on it. Huh?

To go home still hungry after a $32 meal is a huge bummer. 
I think CC gets by because it's an established local joint but I don't expect that I'll be back on purpose any time soon..
