Don't go here!!  The employees are rude and the selection is poor.  The things they do carry are low quality and wayy overpriced. Definitely the worst shop in town...you're better off going anywhere else.  In the area, try Kind Connection, off Thayer st.  They are super nice and have an awesome selection.
