What a freaking ridiculous, overpriced POS to compete with In'N'Out (or my fav place, DogHaus).  

I was SO freaking excited.  I was going to break my diet -- MY DIET THAT I HAD ONLY STARTED 18 HOURS BEFORE -- for a late night Five Guys trip after dropping off a friend at his place near the joint.  SO FREAKING EXCITED.   When I came in, I was happy to see the place was clean and organized and someone greeting us politely while explaining how ordering worked.  I waited and waited and waited because OBVIOUSLY the waiting meant that it was going to be so yummy since everything had to be fresh and made to order.  Free peanuts to pass the time.

Meat dry.  Bun dry.  Fries bland.  No flavor.  No salt.  WORTHLESS calories.

I looked at my husband and said, "It's like the shit you get at a public school cafeteria."  

My husband's review will probably go into more burger critiquing than this review, but the food was so incredibly bland and bad and not worth it that it isn't worth spending that many more words on it.  Carls Jr and Jack are not too far from this location.  I shoulda gone there instead.

(My wallet did get skinnier though.  So the bank account diet is working.)
