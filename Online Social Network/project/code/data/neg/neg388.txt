I've been craving a good pizza for a while and kept hearing about this place from locals. I had to try it out. 

It was like opening up a present on Christmas morning, only to find a pair of socks. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in my life!  Seriously, you can find better pizza at Shop Rite.

I guess for Princeton blue bloods used to Filet Mignon and Dom PÃ©rignon, this is what "real" pizza tastes like.
