Folks at this location seem to never received the memo that states that Checkers is FAST FOOD. Midtown is a haven for great restaurants but occasionally you want something cheap & greasy, and Checkers fits the bill. They actually have tasty seasoned fries - but prepare for a wait, even if there's only one person in the drive thru ahead of you! But I paid $2 for a fish sandwich and fries tonight, can't get any cheaper than that
