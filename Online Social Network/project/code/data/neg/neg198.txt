We've been eyeing this place for weeks since we walk by all the time and saw all the construction going on. Was walking to happy hour one day and decided to come in here instead to try out the food...

The decor is nicely done and looks pretty fancy. However don't expect an intimate dinner, they got the music blasting quite loudly the while night. I think that's pretty good for coming during happy hour, but not for a real dinner... 

The drinks looked yummy and certainly were, too bad the ice to drink ratio was more like 3:1. And the check starts adding up fast. On top of it all the waitress spilled mojito on my Burberry jacket, thanks... thought maybe I would get offered a free drink, but no such luck. Thank goodness you can't see any stains...

Now the food... meh? Prices are certainly up there. $17 for 2 enchiladas. Sure wasn't bad and certainly better than Acalpulco down the street but nothing to write home about. Al pastor tacos was just ok. Meat wasn't super tender, the tacos were on the thick side and too soft to hold up the big glop of meat. Honestly I've had way better from hole in the wall joint with $2 tacos... 

Would I come back again? Sure, if I get too tired the cook and just want to walk down the street. But honestly can't say I would much prefer this to Aculpolco where the portions are larger, pricers cheaper and drinks stronger...
