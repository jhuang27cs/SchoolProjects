Overall service is perfunctory.  I brought my wife's car in for a brake fluid flush and change.  I asked them to check the thickness of the pads and rotors.  They said they were okay.  A couple weeks later went to Yosemite.  I had an unrelated radiator leak so I brought my wife's car back.  Basically, in the span of 500 miles I was told my brakes needed work.  I asked them to pull the wheel and let met see the pads and rotors.  Apparently the caliper hadn't been floating properly for several thousand miles which is something they should have spotted when they flushed the brakes.  One side of the pad was completely worn.  The obvious conclusion is that they never looked at the pads.  My advice is not to bring your car here if Mike isn't around.  So when he goes on his annual vacation to the Old Country don't bring your car here.  Price should not be an overriding concern when servicing your car.  Quality should be.
