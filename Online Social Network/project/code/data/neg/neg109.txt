I waited 15 minutes to get an eye test by an assistant (I told them this was unnecessary because I had just seen an optometrist. They insisted). I then waited for two hours before I saw an eye-doctor. The eye-doctor looked at my eyes for about 5 minutes, decided there was nothing wrong with them and that it was just a deterioration of vision and excused me. The bill I received more than half a year later was for $340!
