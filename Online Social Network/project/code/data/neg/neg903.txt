I hate to be a hater, but I would not recommend this place to anyone. Sure, they've done a good job with the atmosphere, but everything else...bleh. This one waiter interrupted my companion and I in the middle of an obviously hilarious story (we were laughing out loud and talking quickly) to ask if I was done with my half finished salad. It was drenched in dressing, so I said yes, but that's not the point. I ordered the Saltimbocca, medium rare, which I figured would be hard to do wrong - it's a steak with ham and cheese on top. Turns out if you cook a steak to  medium rare, then put ham and mozzarella on top and MICROWAVE the shit out of it, it's not medium rare anymore. In fact, it's barely a steak anymore. And it's certainly not worth $25.95. If I go to a restaurant for a steak, and I'm given a 1/4 lb of flat iron for that price, I should at least feel like I couldn't have done a better job with it myself.

I wouldn't have had a problem with this place had I not cashed out $65 for a meal that consisted of a frozen vegetable medley, microwaved pasta, and a microwaved steak for me and the same thing (minus the steak and plus a lackluster veal scallopini) for my date. Their Tuscan Lemonade (which I probably payed like $3 for) is just Minute Maid with some lemon juice and cane syrup. 

The point is, I felt tricked. Nice decor, nice atmosphere, then BOOM! Microwaved flat iron at fucking sushi prices. I would've refused to pay for the meal, had I not been with my girlfriend. Avoid this place, people, or at least give them a hard time until they get their act together.
