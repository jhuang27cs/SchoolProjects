The other day some friends and I arrived at Salento around 6:30pm(still happy hour time), we ordered, chatted a bit, and then left around 7:30 pm (out of happy hour time). The waiter was less than friendly,  and didn't reply to our questions (she just left while we were about to ask). Probably, she was upset because we didn't plan to eat there. Anyway,  at the cashier  we were charged full price for the wine, although we had been there for the happy hour,  which I don't think was cool at all. Wine is also pretty expensive for the quality. They definitely lost a customer.
