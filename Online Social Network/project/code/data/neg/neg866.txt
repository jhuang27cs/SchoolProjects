This place is just going through the motions. We had several items, but none of them stood out as special. We would never return. 

The hot-and-sour soup was the best of what we ordered, although too peppery for my taste. The egg rolls were soggy and tasteless, even though they seemed to be loaded with shrimp. The chicken lo mein was greasy and had an off flavor. The sweet-and-sour chicken was heavy and tough, plus it had a total turn-off of maraschino cherries in it. 

We had hoped this place would be as good as the similarly named Panda North Restaurant in Brattleboro, VT, which is excellent, but it's not even in the same league.

Much later that same day -- we were about done in digestively by our meals. Don't plan to eat here unless you have an iron stomach.
