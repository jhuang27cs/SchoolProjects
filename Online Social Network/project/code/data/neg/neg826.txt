It looks like a great place.  Clean.  Modern.  But not a place I would frequent.

The main reasons?  It took us over 40 minutes after ordering for our food to come (and it was not a busy day).  And the prices are just not congruent with what you actually get.  

I am not saying the food was bad.  And the service was friendly.  But there was just something missing in the experience.
