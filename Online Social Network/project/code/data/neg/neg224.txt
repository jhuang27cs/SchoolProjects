"Excruciating" - my boyfriend's after dinner analysis of our 2 hour experience at Elements. It was his birthday and we both got the 3-course tasting menu. The ambiance was stuffy and the server was stuffy. The tables were very wide - I felt like I was a mile away from my boyfriend (but I suppose this did give more room for food). 
We didn't really like the first course nor the palate cleansers. The main course - the tuna was very good. Although I didn't like the fact that pork jus was not mentioned on the menu and the server almost poured it on without informing me what he was pouring.
Also, I had requested that they have a candle/iced plate for my boyfriend's birthday and although the hostess assured me that she would take care of it, they did not. 
Perhaps I should give it another chance for the pure foodie experience but don't think I'll do it any time soon.
