I used to really enjoy Crema Cafe. The food is still pretty decent and the teas are delightful (or so I hear). But I'm a coffee drinker. 

Before, I had bought into this place as the go-to coffee provider in Harvard Square. But I was only ordering cappuccinos then. The last two visits I ordered an iced coffee and a single shot of espresso. It's really hard to get the latter right. So easy to burn and make bitter. But iced coffee? I was surprised at the unholy bitter brew that was poured on the rocks for me. 

And my espresso today was even worse. Not sure if the baristas are new, or what it is; but I'm worried that my go-to place for a North End style cup o' joe in Harvard Square is souring.
