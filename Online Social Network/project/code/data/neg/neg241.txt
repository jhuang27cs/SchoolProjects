I'd really like to like this place, and I had a decent experience, but I wasn't impressed.  The noodles are okay, the menu selection a bit weird, and the overall feel was less than excellent.  It's not bad for Ann Arbor, but I've been to lots of similar places in other towns that were better, but themselves only average in the grand scheme of things.  So what I'm saying is, "Meh, I've experienced better." but that doesn't I mean I wouldn't come here as long as I were stuck in Ann Arbor.
