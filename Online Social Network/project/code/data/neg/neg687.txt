I have only done brunch here and once was enough. Reason #1, the food was cool in temperature. Even when the food was freshly put out it cooled down quickly on the buffet. Reason #2 In other cases the food was weird, like saffron rice which was crunchy, crunchy. Reason #3, the wait staff was running around with T-shirts that said "Bacon" which reminds of the dog food commercial but the bacon was actually one of the best things on the buffet, even cool. Reason #4, the desserts were unbelievably sweet that all of them tasted like, well, sugar. Finally, service was weak-we were never offered the included coffee or tea and had to put our plates out to the middle of the table to have them taken away. 

We have had better service and food at Tanjore for less than half the price. The Blue Room gave me the blues.
