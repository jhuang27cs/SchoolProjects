I love Gone with the Wind, really, I do and if you've spent any time in the South (particularly as a woman) you know how important Peggy Mitchell's book is to this part of the country. 

That being said this museum was terrible. We came in just after a tour started but were asked to wait an hour and to pay $12 (we weren't welcome to roam through on our own). After purchasing tickets, we wandered through a small biographical exhibit and watched part of the documentary of the making of the film. 

20-minutes into our wait we heard the tour wrapping up and were hoping that we might not have to wait after all. No such luck. We continued to sit until the docent decided to march all 12 of us into the tiny, one-bedroom apartment. Between this woman stumbling over her words and fiddling with her headband, we learned about the living room, the bedroom and the kitchen.

And that was it. Took maybe 10 minutes. 

Admittedly I was spoiled coming from a terrific museum experience at the Allman Brothers Band's Big House in Macon the day before but snakes alive this was all shades of bad. They must sustain themselves based on people's warm fuzzy feelings for the book because the experience itself was pretty close to terrible. What a shame - it could have been so much more.
