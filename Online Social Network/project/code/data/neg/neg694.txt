I was disappointed, and given the many other choices for indian food, I will never return here.  My boyfriend and I had a groupon that we presented to the server at the beginning of the meal.  We ordered our food and it came out pretty quickly.  Mango lassi and pakoras were yummy, but the Samosa was quite terrible.  It had no flavoring, and the inside potato and chickpea stuffing was colorless, as if it there were no spices added.  I've had better samosas frozen from a box.  Entrees were pretty good.  Halfway through our meal we were given another server, who was totally unfriendly and gave us a huge hassle about the groupon.  First he told us we needed to buy an additional item because we only spent 29.75, not 30 dollars.  We told him that we could use the groupon for less than the amount, and we weren't expecting the change back. He grumbled away and came back saying we owed 5 dollars for the lassi.  He said bar items didn't count towards the total.  Eventually the manager came over and sorted everything, since the lassi wasn't an alcoholic beverage.  In addition to the bad service, they lit strong incense a few feet away from us while we were still eating.  Completely overpowering and made us want to run out of there.  Completely ruined our dining experience.
