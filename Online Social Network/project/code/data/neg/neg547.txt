If you have to get a bunch of copies done quickly, allow more time than you think you need. Learn from my mistake. 

I am my company's event planner. I was in the midst of a workshop at a hotel ballroom when I realized  last minute that we should have made copies of a PowerPoint presentation, so I raced from Bala Cynwyd down to the closest copy center, which was this place. I had an hour. The presentation was 10 pages, front and back, stapled, and I wanted 100 copies. 

I thought it would be a quick and easy job, in and out. But, no. They only had two copiers that were operational, and they were small copiers, not the kind I'd expect at a business that makes copies for people. It took 55 minutes! I was staring at the clock and as I began to realize how long this was going to take, I started to cry silently as I stood there. I felt like I was going to get fired. 

In the midst of the copy job, the copier ran out of staples so the job had to be sent to the other copier. The two employees who were behind the counter were moving in super slow motion even though I let them know when I got there that I was kind of in a hurry.

Finally they were done, I paid the $100-plus charge (cringe, but work paid) and I literally ran out. 

I debated whether I should give this place one or two stars. I decided on two, because my displeasure stemmed partially from my own lack of planning and the fact that I didn't make the copies at my office in advance. But man, if you get in a jam and have to get copies here, don't expect any high tech equipment or efficiency.
