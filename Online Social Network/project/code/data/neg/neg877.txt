Sorry guys!  If you take the hot dogs away it's just an ice cream and cookie place.  Albeit a good ice cream and cookie place but without the incredible hot dog deal to go with it my 10 yr old son said "Can you give them no stars?"

Saddest success story I've ever heard, really.

Bring the hot dogs back.
