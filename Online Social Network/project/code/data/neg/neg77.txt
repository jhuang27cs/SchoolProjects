Let me just start off on how useless hiring a traffic lawyer is. If you speak English and have no problem talking to authority, don't waste your money! Even if you do not speak English, don't get  hustled by these cons. I know for a fact I would've  A: Gotten out faster
                                    B: Not had such a headache 
                                    C: Wasted my money.  

I could've done what  "lawyer" did by myself. First I get there and I already assume I will be waiting since it is court, but on top of the two hours I waited for the judge my lawyer was no where to be found. He was "too busy in other rooms to get with me promptly. 

Get prepared to be treated like a hassle or a pest. I got there at 8 and when my lawyer was going to present my case and tell the judge what I wanted to do, he did not want to speak to my lawyer. so i had to come back at 1:15. I''m sorry but being in court from 8am - 1:30pm is UNACCEPTABLE.

On top of it all he kept asking me, what did I want to do?... Aren't you supposed to know what's best for me legally? Don't even bother with these guys they arent worth the money for their lack of compassion and human  interest.
