Went back. Had a bunch of rolls. Sushi was standard fare. Soondobu cut it, wasn't magnificent or amazing. 

My problem with this restaurant is that it tries to be professional and good, and yet its waitstaff are so untrained. It got to the point where their inadequacy was almost frustrating. They didn't know what items were, they knocked things over, spilled food on the table, didn't know how to order things, and were generally slow and painfully annoying. They were friendly and I saw that they tried, but that doesn't make up for their lack of expertise.

In addition, when your customers are waiting for their food, don't try to take multiple photos of the dishes in front of them. It's annoying and tacky.
