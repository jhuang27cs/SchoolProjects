This may be the first review written about a place by a person who has never even been there.  
We were planning to have dinner there for 10 of us to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We had to give a CC # to make the reservation, we're told everyone had a $30 minimum, and the CC would be charged if anyone did not show up.  We were told everyone had to bring cash because they would not split the check. 
I was skeptical when I read the yelpers reviews but didn't want to suggest another place, because I thought the birthday girl wanted to go.
We canceled the reservation.  We're going to try Ra Sushi.
