The Asian Ghetto is truly ghetto: the dining area that's in the center of the ghetto is always filthy and nobody ever cleans it; right outside, there's always homeless people hanging out asking for money; there's hoards and hoards of pigeons walking around picking up food people dropped onto the ground. All this, makes for a very nasty place to eat at. If you come later in the day, there's also a funky smell here, from all the discarded food and the homeless people that run through the place. 


The restaurants themselves are not bad (I have reviewed them separately), but this is a review for the square and the square is no good. I went down to UCSD recently and their food court, the equivalent of the ghetto, is incredible. Infinitely cleaner than the ghetto. 

Note: most restaurants in the Asian Ghetto are cash only.
