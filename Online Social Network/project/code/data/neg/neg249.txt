I didn't know this place was called California Teriyaki Bowl. Up until I found this listing, it was always the place by Kaplan to me. Anyway, I think it might have changed ownership in the past year or something because it used to be awesome, but now I can't even get myself to go back. The quality of the rice is so bad that I wouldn't even feed it to my cat. The consistency makes me wonder if they decided to prepare it with a steam roller. 

Food: The best things on the menu are the deep fried rolls (they're called "Its" for some odd reason). These lumps of tempera goodness come in either tuna or California roll variety. I would advise against the tuna rolls as the deep frying process cooks the fish to a canned-like state. Avoid weird items on the menu. I tried the quail egg once and the waitress didn't even know what it was or that they served it. The thing was microscopic and even though it was only about a dollar, I felt like I got ripped off. In general, the quality of sushi here is very poor, but it's cheap (especially after 5:00 pm when the price is halved) and filling. Expect to pay about $7.00 for a meal. 


Atmosphere: The doors are typically open to the patio where smokers like to convene. This may or may not be a plus to you, but it was just fyi. The tables are often dirty and cramped, but usually it's pretty empty so you can spread out. 

Service: You can sit for an hour without being given the check. I typically have to ask or stand by the cash register until someone helps me.
