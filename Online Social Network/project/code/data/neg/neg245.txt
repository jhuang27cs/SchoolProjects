Fantastic atmosphere, reasonable prices, and terrible service. I felt like the bartender was actively angry to have us, the paying customers, there, and would do anything to make sure we left. We left alright, a 1 dollar tip on a 10 dollar bill. This bar is exactly what Troy needs, except for the shitty service. 

Awesome bar, will not return until they fire the bitchy bartenders, and I spend alot at bars.
