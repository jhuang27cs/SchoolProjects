I'll admit that I did enjoy this place when I first came to campus and was on look out for a new place to eat. However, I soon learned that this place has the utmost WORST service in the area. I returned 3 additional times after one of my bad experiences and they just got worst and worst. 

1. They are horrible at seating you

2. They are just pathetic about taking orders and refilling drinks

3. Gratuity is like...18%?! and for a group of 4-5.. Even the nice places in U-village are better than that. 

4. They DEMAND tip. I sincerely believe that people should tip, however, only the deserving shall be rewarded! My friends and I had a poor experience here from beginning to end so we were only going to leave little to no tip, but they harassed us and kept saying things like "tip, tip" "where is the tip" "you forgot to tip" "more tip" "not enough" etc etc  So in the end, they got a buck.  (you'll notice that all the other reviews make note of this too! lol) 

Heres a tip: Don't go here, if you want thai food on the Ave, hit up AppeThai or Little Thai...OR go to Siams if you're willing to go further out for darn good Thai food.

On a side note: I've heard that this place has been busted several times for charging people extra, after they have paid and left. If you know how a credit card machine works, then you'll realize that they can add as much tip as they want. So if you MUST go here, do not use your credit card.
