Let's get this out of the way: my experience here was utter crap. 

I am by any stretch of the imagination a "photographer" and I had the unfortunate of getting a store associate who thought he was hot s***. I came in just asking for advice on a lens, intending to buy it if I found the right one.

What I got was an excessive amount of back-sass and rudeness. I don't have a thousand bucks to drop on a lens, but I think I can still afford a decent one, but that apparently was not god enough for this guy. It was a very awkward exchange - me asking what were probably pretty basic questions and just getting an stank elitist face in return.

So after a pretty awkward exchange, I said I needed to give it a thought before I made the purchase so I asked for a validation (Don't park in that lot btw) and this is what I got as a response "Well if that's all you came in here for."

Overall probably one of the most god-awful experiences I've ever had trying to purchase something $300+. Next time I'll just go to Best Buy and get the equipment I need sans attitude.
