So I didn't actually get to eat here. I am not even sure why I came in here. It's Saturday night and most restaurants on the Ave were busy. This restaurant had no one in there. I ordered the garlic beef and was told they were out of beef. That was pretty disappointing because I really was craving beef. Finally, I decided on the shrimp cake.  They guy comes back and told me they were out of the that. To me a restaurant being out of so many items is like walking into Starbucks and being told that they were out of coffee. WTF? I did feel bad because I left without ordering. But I didn't want to order again just to be told they are out of it.
