Came here for lunch one day. I got 2 rolls: philly and caterpillar. They were ok but I didn't think it was enough for a $20 lunch for one. I thought it was kind of expensive for being near UCSD for college budgets. They were doing a special now of 3 rolls for the price of 2 but I couldn't eat 3 solo. It was alright, nothing special here though for me to come back.
