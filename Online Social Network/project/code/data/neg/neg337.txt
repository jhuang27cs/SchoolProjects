Ok, I really want to love sprinkles but after visiting a couple of times now and experiencing some people have brought to parties or the office... I'm just not feeling it.  

I remember the first time I had their red velvet, I really enjoyed it.  Maybe now because I know of so many awesome red velvets, when I had it recently, I found the cake itself bland.  The frosting is really what makes their cupcakes.  However, while I think they put on an ok amount, it could be a little more, especially for what you're paying.  And the strawberry cupcake was blah with the frosting being too sweet.

I'll go back to Kara's while continuing my hunt for delicious cupcakes in the Bay Area.
