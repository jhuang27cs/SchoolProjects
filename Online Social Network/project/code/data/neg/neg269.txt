Naan N Curry on Telegraph is very spacious and close to campus. I only come here when I have a deal. College life = broke life.

Chicken Tikki Masala: Ehh, I've had better. The chunks of chicken are either a hit or miss. I hate when they're dry :(
Vegetable Tikki Masala: Ehh. There's really nothing to say about this. It was acceptable.
Garlic Naan: Wasn't warm. Skimped on the garlic for sure.

Everything was mediocre at best. My food has consistently came out lukewarm too. I don't see myself ever coming here without a coupon. Best thing about this place is probably the free chai in the back!
For good Indian food around the UC Berkeley campus, I definitely recommend Indian Flavors Express on Bancroft.
