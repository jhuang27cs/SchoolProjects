This review is for their catering, specifically for the holidays. We ordered the Turkey dinner with Stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, a yam casserole and a pie. On Thanksgiving, it is so much more about the gratitude and being with loved ones than it is the food, but I'll likely not place another order from Elijah's. 

Pro's: The turkey was juicy, the apple pie was good and the staff on the phone and delivery was very friendly. 

Con's: The stuffing was a tray of bread crumbs (literally it wasn't like stuffing at all, but rather a bunch of bread crumbs), the turkey was small and I'm not sure how it would've fed 12 people if everyone had shown up, the yam casserole felt like just a bunch of yams and sugar thrown in a pan, and the gravy was cold (which was fine, we just heated it up) and overall it wasn't much food for the price. 

I cooked some other side dishes which was great, but the meal itself didn't feel like it was prepared with that extra dollop of love and care and it was a bit overpriced for what it was.
