What the eff Yamato.

Now I completely agree with Jill T. but here's my most recent Yamato experience. 

Yamato, I initially gave you four stars but with your horrific service and attitude towards your customers, I give you 1 star. 

My experience? I came here with my friend Sam N. and my other friend Patrick M. I ordered Shumai, which did not come until 1.5 hours later - with no apology, no nothing. An hour and a half later... FOR SHUMAI. This was supposed to be an appetizer! This was supposed to come out before my sushi! I was sad and hungry. Also, Sam N.'s Baked Lobster was cold in the middle and her portions were so small.  Our waitress, never checked in on us (which is also why my appetizer took too long) and we were sitting right behind the hostess' table. -_-' Not to mention, it took forever to get our check and leave. My best friend is a sushi waitress and I can understand the restaurant is busy, but it doesn't excuse the lack of amiability or attention to our table.

This is really not okay. 
The reason why I gave Yamato's 1 star instead of 0 was because of Jesse, my last waiter, who really made an awesome impression on our table and gave us the extra attention I never see at this restaurant. I sincerely wish that service was replicated at every single order of Yamato.

Daryl W. has made an awesome point: word of mouth is a powerful tool and I have already seen Jill T.'s review on facebook with MY fraternity brothers and my friends talking about it. 

Peace out, Yamato.
After the piss poor service and mediocre sushi, I'm out of here.
