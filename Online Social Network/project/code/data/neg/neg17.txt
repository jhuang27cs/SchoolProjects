I was required to give a star before posting......but this place is not even worth 1 star.  Absolutely the worst experience ever!  

Upon arrival no one at Valet.
 
No visible signage- as where to check in.  Had to ask a bunch of teenagers laying all over the floor and couches where the front desk was.  No one available to help with luggage!

 Room was suppose to be king with sofa bed..............no sofa bed(two love seats) no available roll always.......no extra pillows or linens.....no other rooms available.....no where for my teenage daughter to sleep other than in a king bed with us.  

Rose at front desk not helpful at all!  Everyone else in Management off until Monday....no help to me, I was leaving on Sunday.  If it hadn't of been 11:45 at night I would have went and found a different hotel.

Run, run far away!  Find somewhere else to stay......this place is not worthy of the Hilton name!
