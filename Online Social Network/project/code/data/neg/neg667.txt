Been here three or four times on Penn's dime.  Consistently underwhelming, hype over quality.  Lunch the other day was ramen soup, which was not as good as what you get out of a 59 cent bag -- inedibly salty, with dumplings that had clearly gone straight from the freezer to the microwave.  

I'm with the school that thinks Stephen Starr is net drag on the Philadelphia food scene, occupying the high end with a loud soundtrack rather than good food.
