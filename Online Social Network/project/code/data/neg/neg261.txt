I ordered a marguerite pizza with bacon, garlic, onions, and mushrooms.  I really entertained/enjoyed the concept of customizing my own pizza, having it made in front of me, and seeing my pizza thrown in the oven.  There's only one problem - THE PIZZA WAS EXTREMELY SALTY!  They threw sea salt on the pizza after it came out of the oven without asking me.  All I could taste was salt!  I wanted to enjoy my fresh basil, mozzarella, onion, garlic, and bacon.  Bacon and mozzarella already have natural sodium; why did they need to add more?!  I was incredibly disappointed, but my friend convinced me that it usually wasn't that salty and to try it again next time.  Due to her, the friendliness of the staff, the awesome concept, and incredibly high tech soda machine (that I didn't know how to use...but it was fun figuring out), I will definitely try this place again.  BUT IF YOU SEE SALT ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR PIZZA, TELL THEM TO STOP IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT BECOMES INEDIBLE!
