Being a "band girlfriend", I have been here more times than I can count. Spatially, it's a decent place to see a show, though if youre not in the main room, the wall pretty much blocks any view of the band. 

The acoustics suck now too, where they used to be great-- there used to be a drop ceiling and they took it out-- so the sound gets lost up in the pipes and beams. To compensate, the sound guy cranks everything WAY up, to the point you're yelling "OW" instead of "rock and roooooollllll!" with you arm up in the Beavis and Butt-Head position.
 
From a band perspective, the lack of a real backstage is a pain in the ass. (Where are you supposed to do your drugs, man?)Plus you have to haul your equipment through the whole damn club and crowd to get it in and out the main entrance door-- there's no back way out. So if you play a show, expect not to be able to load out until the crowd is gone. 

I've seen some amazing national and international bands here since I started coming 7 years ago, but in the past year or two they haven't been booking anything even remotely exciting, save the few really good local bands who play every so often. 

Take Great Scott, the Paradise, or the Middle East over this joint, if you have a choice.
