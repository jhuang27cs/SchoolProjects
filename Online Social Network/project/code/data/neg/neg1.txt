Cannot believe how highly rated this place is, wow. Takes forever for them to get orders out even when its super slow. Our pizza took something like 65 minutes from the time we ordered it. Now i will wait that long if the pizza is going to be amazing, like at pizza popilis down in greek town. But this pizza was average at best. I think that the gluten free offerings are great but I really expected alot more. Great renovations btw the place looks amazing.
