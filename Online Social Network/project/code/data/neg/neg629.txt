I like vegetables and food but I do NOT like Veggie Galaxy. We got a zebra shake, a Greek salad, and a Cobb salad. The zebra shake tasted awful--I thought it would be a regular dairy shake but it tasted really artificial so I assume it's vegan. You would think that a place named veggie galaxy would be able to make a good salad but both salads had too much dressing (both dressings were way too tart) and the Greek salad tasted nothing like a Greek salad. I had to go across the street and eat at McDonald's afterward.

Additionally the service was pretty subpar. The staff was nice but we had to wait a long time to put in our order. Our waitress also put the pitcher of water on the FLOOR in order to get out her little pad of paper. WHAT?!? No item of food or drink should EVER be placed on the floor. I have never seen that done anywhere else.
