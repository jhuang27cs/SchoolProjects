I went a few times back in the winter and had great meals each time.  My food was prepared as spicy as I requested, the paneer pakoras were really excellent, and everything was quite tasty.  

Then I went again this week and had a totally different experience.  I wonder if they got a different chef because our food was very different than the food we had on our previous visits.  The paneer pakoras were totally different this time around- more like the cheese had been mushed or ground up then fried.  Not necessarily bad, just a totally different recipe than before.   Our main dishes were also pretty sub-par.  We both ordered our dishes spicy, and we both got totally bland food.  Not just mild, but zero spice.  My malai kofta was also different than its previous incarnations- sauce was a bit goopey-er and less flavored.

The place isn't terrible, but it's definitely just  barely average.  It's too bad, too, because I had really enjoyed it on my previous visits.
