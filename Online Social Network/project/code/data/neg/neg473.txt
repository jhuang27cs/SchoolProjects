Just had lunch here and the server was awful. As someone that has worked as a server for a few years I understand that it is hard work, but this was ridiculous. All of the neighboring tables were also having some issues such as 
- drinks not being served after multiple requests
- he spilled soy sauce on a woman's purse (a COACH purse at that!) He then proceeded to scrub the hell out of the material with a wet wash cloth from the kitchen
- he forgot to bring us plates for sushi
- we asked multiple times for water, additional napkins
- we were never checked on
- he forgot half of our order and when we asked about it he said he didn't write it down and are we sure that we ordered those items. WTF

I'm usually pretty forgiving for service issues, but the server moved in such a lackadaisical manner that I'm also appalled that the manager has not addressed these issues and he is allowed to even carry himself in such a sleepy/uncaring manner when at work. 

The food despite the service was good, but this was normally my go to sushi place... I don't feel like I would return after this experience.
