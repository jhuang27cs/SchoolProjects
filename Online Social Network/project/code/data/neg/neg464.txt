After visiting twice, I had to write a review.  I've been to plenty of other iHops when traveling and they're always good and worth the value & wait time.  Not this one!  Last time they took forever to get us our our breakfast, same again this time.  I had to mention to the waiter that we were in a bit of a time crunch because we had to make it to the airport on time.  He spent 15mins entering our order and came back twice to confirm what our order was.  I knew our order was going to be messed up after that, but so was our bill.  In the end we paid for an extra order of pancakes and we didn't have time to fix it or argue with the cashier.

My main complaint is that this iHop takes shortcuts.  Every time we order the special pancakes, they don't make them as described.  No banana's or macadamia nuts or egg nog filling inside the pancake.  They just slap it on top and deliver it to your table.  Not only does it not fit the description, it doesn't look like the pictures on the menu.
