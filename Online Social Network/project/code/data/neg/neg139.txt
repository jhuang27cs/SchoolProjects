Oh American Apparel. You're overpriced. You're seedy. You make me feel fat. Basically, you're that pervy old pseudo-relative who can simultaneously make you feel inadequate AND like you're about to get touched in naughty ways. Not my favorite character.

I have major beef with Dov Charny, with their "living wage" claims, with their sexist ads.

But uh, some of their clothing is pretty cool. I own that high waisted denim skirt and it's great... just made with sin =/
