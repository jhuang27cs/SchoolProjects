I don't know about you, but I don't go out to eat to have someone's 'RULES" almost literally shoved down my throat.

BEWARE.  They have a $15 per person minimum policy that they AGGRESSIVELY ENFORCE.  We were NOT informed of this when we were seated, nor did we see the small print on the front of their menu, which reads "RULES OF THE HOUSE".  We simply wanted to try the place out on our first trip to Claremont and were not aware of the policy.  The server became extremely irritated with us and all but forced us to order several more tapas just to meet the $15 per person minimum.  We were not at all hungry at this point and were forced to order food we did not want.

They COULD have been gracious enough to let it slide for first-timers.
  
This is NOT the way to make a good first impression.


WILL NOT RETURN.
