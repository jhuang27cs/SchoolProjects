I might have liked this place a little better had our waitress actually paid attention to us. My party wasn't tucked in a corner either! We had a window booth in between 2 other parties, and there were a couple other tables of people near us too. She tended to all of them very well, but we were nearly invisible to her.

I got the veggie quesadilla, which was fine. Not good, just fine. I don't think I've ever had a veggie quesadilla with huge chunks of carrot in it... not bad, just weird.
