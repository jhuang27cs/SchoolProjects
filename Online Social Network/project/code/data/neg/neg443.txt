Just two things to say about this place: 
1. The food was delicious. 
2. The service was awful.  Our waitress was SO slow.  At first we thought she was punishing us because we weren't ready to order when she came to our table and had us waiting another ten minutes to order--ten minutes.  Then we ran out of chips.  We asked her for more, but she must have forgotten.  The busboy was kind enough to bring us not only more chips, but our dinner plates as well.   Our waitress never came back to ask us how our dinner was nor if we needed anything else.  My friend had wanted to order a beer--oh well. 

Again, the food was great the service just sucked.
