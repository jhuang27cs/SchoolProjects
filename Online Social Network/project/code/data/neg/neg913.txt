If you're looking for hip hop, a dress to impress crowd, and a good dance floor...this is not the place. Don't be deceived by the long line and expensive drinks into thinking this is a hip club or lounge. I was shocked to go inside and find people wearing flip flops and backpacks on a Friday night! If I'm in the area again, I will definitely head towards any of the bars/lounges in central square instead.
