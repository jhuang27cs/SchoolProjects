Poor Food, Mediocre Service, Probably Ain't Going Back.

The Good - The cornbread is pretty good and comes straight out of the oven, though I have had better.  Tasted the New York steak which was good, but not as good as I thought for the same owners at the Arroyo Chophouse.  The steak is better than Houstons, but I'd rather go to Madeleines or Ruths Chris at these prices.  The Newcastle beer comes straight from a bottle - cannot mess that one up.

The Bad - The Short Ribs Osso Bucco style looked way better than they were.  I was not enjoying any of this, except a few bites of the mashed potatoes and baby carrots.  It lacked flavor and what flavor it did have was gross (BTW - their steak sauce is also very yukkky!).

The crispy Ahi appetizer was also terrible.  Maybe, it was because you do not order fish on a Sunday.  The spicy dipping sauce and lime helped hide the terrible cuts of fish.

The Mediocre - The service was a little slow because our waiter was working 1/3 of the room (maybe an exaggeration, but felt like it).  Luckily, one of the hostesses helped out.  We were there early so they told us we would have to wait 5-10 minutes for a table inside (it was 1/4 full at the time).  After 10 minutes, they showed us to one of 2 dozen empty tables --- Why the Wait?????????

I remember having a great burger about 2 years ago here, but I don't think the food is even close today.  Would have got one star, but our waiter gave us the cornbread complimentary.  My words, "that was a total waste of money."

How it remains so busy, I do not know....
