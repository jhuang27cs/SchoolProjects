I can't remember the last time I gave 1 star.  But, this visit to Rusell deserves it.

First, we arrived at 8pm tonight, were told the wait was 30 minutes for the 4 of us and we waited an hour.  But, this happens, so no huge deal.

After waiting an hour, we were seated upstairs at a table in the corner.  It was fine, but upstairs is extremely loud for eating.  When I went downstairs to use the bathroom a few minutes later, I noticed that there were at least 2 4-tops ready for seating... why hadn't we been seated there?  This is where the real 1-star part begins.

How many minutes to get water?  10.
How many minutes to get our first round of drinks?  About 15.
The pig's head appetizer?  Tasted like grease and that's it.
The complementary bread on the table was stale and the garlic/evoo dip tastes nearly rancid if you dipped your bread in far enough to get the garlic.
The sausage pizza?  Salt.  Bread, sausage and cheese are all salty on their own.  WHY would you add a bunch of salt on top of the pizza??
Burger ordered medium?  It came out barely rare and also overly salted.

We're not a tough going crowd when it comes to restaurants, but all 4 of us had exactly the same strong reaction: come for drinks, leave for food and service.  It's too bad.
