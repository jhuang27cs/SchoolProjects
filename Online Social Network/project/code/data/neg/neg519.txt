After visiting this shop, I think I prefer Haagen Daz by the pint at the grocery store.  At least I have more variety in terms of ice cream flavors.  The store offers a ton more variations, such as shakes, cookies and other snacks.  However, the execution and service doesn't do the brand justice.  My vanilla bean expresso sundae was such a disappointment for $5 because it was half full and droopy like liquid goo that was almost inedible.  

There isn't much seating inside or outside.  Moreover, this place isn't worth coming back given the other dessert options.
