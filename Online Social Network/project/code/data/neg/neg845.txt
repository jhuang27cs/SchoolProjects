Food was ok, but worst service imaginable. The place was empty and still took 20 mins to get a salad and a bowl of gazpacho, a soup that isn't even cooked. When salad came the order was screwed up. Then another five mins to get salad right. After that fiasco we asked waitress for a water fill up that never came.  Don't go here ever!
