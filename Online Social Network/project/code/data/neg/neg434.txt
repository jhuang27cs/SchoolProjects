The web site, photos and video made me go to this place. That part was very well done. Whoever did the photos did a great job. I wanted to love the food but didn't. I am not a Yucatan expert but I thought the food should have more flavor and the flavor it had was out of balance. As if someone just added a bunch Yucatan spices thinking this way to cook. Also the food did not look as fresh in person. The atmosphere is uncomfortable. I felt like was eating inside a 7-11. They should work on smoothing out the cuisine and making their area more appealing.
