Of course with their other 2 places in mind, I was expecting something great.  What we got was mediocre. Seriously bummed at this experience. They poured the wrong wine, the service was slow, 2 of 4 entrees had to be sent back because they were cold. They gave us a deal because they realized how terrible it was. The manager was very apologetic and generous. It was obvious that it's been happening a lot. Too bad. I might go back in a few months. There are plenty of good choices in the area so it might take me awhile to get back there. 
I do need to try the actual bakery. The stuff looked amazing through the window!
