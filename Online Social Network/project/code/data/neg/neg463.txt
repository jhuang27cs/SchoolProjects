I come every 3ish weeks to get my eyebrows threaded. One woman there is amazing - not too painful, super fast, great shaped eybrows, she would get 4 stars because, well threading should cost a lot less than 15 bucks. Another woman there, 3 stars - great shape, pretty fast, pretty painful. Once I had someone new - messed up the shape, SUPER slow, super painful - made me bleed - 0 stars. Thankfully woman number 2 came in and fixed it.
