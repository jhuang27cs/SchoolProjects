If you're going to move into Westwood, put TONS of money into your store front and interior, and compete with 20 other yogurt/coffee stores, do your market research first!!!

This place is overpriced for the yogurt. They would do well to consolidate their menu to do a few things, well. Also, don't try to charge me a dollar for whipped cream and a cherry.

I've been here twice- the first time, all I wanted was some tart yogurt and a pile of fruit. I ordered my yogurt (3.50-4.00 for the yogurt alone), and asked for bananas on top (an extra .50). The man behind the counter forgot the banana. I reminded him. He looked confused and said, "Oh, well, I can put it on the side?" Me: "No thanks, I'll just skip it, I kinda wanted it ON the yogurt." (Plus it was expensive for only one topping)

The yogurt was tasty but after that odd exchange I was just "meh" about the place and wished I'd gone to Yogurtland.

The second time I went was after having received a free coffee coupon. I go inside, and the man behind the counter (different guy) is serving one person. He doesn't look up or say hi when I come in. He makes a latte, rings it up, then asks me what I want. He gives me my free coffee, 2/3 full (really weird), and I go in search of creamer besides half&half and sugar subs besides sweet n' low. Not to be found.

I should have skipped the coffee and joined the homeless man smoking a cigar on the bench out front.
