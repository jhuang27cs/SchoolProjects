Too bad I can't rate this place with NO star!  What a horrible experience!  The salon is quite beautiful and I naively walked in.  Immediately, two or three women approached me and as I was trying to tell them I just wanted a full set of acrylic nails, they are bombarding me with questions....wanting me to get other services.  They suggested a pedicure so I agreed.  Once in the chair, they were all over me!  One woman grabbed my right hand and another grabbed my left.  Another started working on my feet. They did NOT soak my old nails off but started digging and cutting them off with a pincher thing.  I kept telling them they were hurting me but that did little good.  The one on the left said, "I give you special manicure...only $15 more!"  She started cutting my cuticles and that took about a minute and THAT was ALL I got for my $15.  Then  a fourth woman comes over and ask if I'd like to have my eyebrows waxed.  Ok.  Why not.  Then she wants to do my chin and around my upper lip.  Ok.  The next thing I know, she has waxed my entire chin and RIPPED my skin off.  She did the same to my cheek and RIPPED a piece of skin off the size of a quarter!  So, I ended up with THE worst set of acrylic nails I've ever had, a decent pedicure, and an injured face for $i48 AND had to tip FOUR people!  I wanted to scream at them what a terrible job they had done but all I wanted to do was get out of there!  NEVER go to this place!
