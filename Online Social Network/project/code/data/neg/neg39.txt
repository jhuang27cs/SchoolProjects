What happened to the food????

I used to go a ton to Blakes for the food...which was excellent...but the menu has changed and the quality has PLUMMETED. What has happened? My boyfriend's hamburger (ordered as medium rare) was overcooked, the ice tea had a sulfer flavor, they used to have a fantastic portobello sandwhich and this new one was truely uninspired. I'm very disppointed as Blakes food used to be excellent.
