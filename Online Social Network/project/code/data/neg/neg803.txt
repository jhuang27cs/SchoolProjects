This was a new place so I decided to check it out. The tri-tip streak sandwich I had was god awful. Some pieces of tri-tip steak and two pieces of sandwich bread with a side of bbq sauce. The steak was a little too dry and there were no veggies to make it more moist. For the first item on their menu, I expected much more especially since it cost $9. 

The place has a lot of space so I could see how it would be great for sport hangouts, and they even have pool tables downstairs. However, if the food continues to be this bad, I don't think I'll be able to return.
