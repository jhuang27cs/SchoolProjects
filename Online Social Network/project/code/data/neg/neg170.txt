Multiple visits over many years and it's always the same. I use them only for emergency services. How can they knowingly, in good conscience, make sick pets wait over an hour in a room for help.  Then, after care is provided-make the pets wait another hour for "the bill"!  Even when I had to euthanize my cat, I had to wait in the room over an hour with a suffering pet. They apologized for the wait because they had to attendt to emergencies - I get that-  then have more people on a shift!  For it to happen every time I've been- eight times-makes me question their credibility.   Yes, this is a harsh review-but as many others have stated-they're all about the money.  My sick cat went in tonight and I was told she needed hospitalization so she could get fluids.  I brought it up that I could -and was willing-to give her the fluids at home-as I had been given that option for another one of my cats from our regular vet.  My experience has been that  VCA always recommends as many tests as they can-where other vets start with basic blood panel and go from there.  Don't get me wrong-the staff and Dr.s are very nice- it's just there is very little common sense utilized in regard to wait time and comfort for our pets. Again-emergencies only!!!
