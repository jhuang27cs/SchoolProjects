I've only had it once, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. The prospect of an Indianized burrito is exciting, but the execution feels a little off. One thing that Chipotle does so well is to make their burritos large yet still manageable. The wrap I got at Urbann Turbann (on a wheat wrap, not naan) was bursting at the seems.

Younger me would have been really excited for the extra food, but it kind of just seemed like overkill, and it was pretty messy. 

I am also unconvinced that Indian flavors are generic enough such that you can slap on any sauces you want.
