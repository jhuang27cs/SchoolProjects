Is it just me, or does anyone else get major tummy aches after eating at Bombay Coast?

Maybe my stomach can't handle the spices of Indian food in general, but every time I've come to eat here, my meal is satisfying until the last bite -- then when my stomach starts to grumble.

I've been craving Indian food on more than one occasion lately, and every time I do get food, I always end up regretting later (and yet I still continue the vicious cycle...)

First time I went here I had the vegetarian-option combo. Got the channa masala, which was pretty good, the baigan bharta (or whatever it's called), which was a little too sweet of a curry for me, and something else that was obviously forgettable and probably got mixed in with my other options. 

The second time I had the #1 combo, cause on the weekends its only $5.99. Got the chicken tikka masala (probably the most recognizable/cliche item to order), aloo mutter, and some super spicy beef curry. The food was a lot better this time around; it was under-spiced, and I managed to get a taste of all three options without one over-powering the other. 

Note: The chicken tikka masala tastes JUST like the frozen entree you can get at Trader Joes. Don't know if that's just TJ being awesome, or BC being lame...

The curries are way too watery for my liking... so watery that the curries just kind of blend together to create a schloppy mess. Sure, they're supposed to be pretty soupy (to dip in your naan, I suppose?) but there's like no meat in there whatsoever.  The naan was just plain meh too, not fresh and rather bland. 

I do really like the mint chutney though, it cuts a lot of the spicy.

And yes, I gave it a 2 star review, but will I be back? You betcha. I need my Indian food fix, and this is the most convenient way to do so.
