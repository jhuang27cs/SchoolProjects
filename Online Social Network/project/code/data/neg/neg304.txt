When it comes down to it, this place just isn't for me.  Now, granted, I have become accustomed to the spoils of great hookah establishments such as Lava in Broad Ripple, but for the price and net satisfaction: I was less than pleased.
Perhaps it was me being overly sensitive, but I got a very thick waft of arrogance from the greeting staff, inspecting us and our credentials upon entering the bar.  I get it - we're in a college town, but that'should not be your excuse for rude service. It perpetuated after we requested to be seated by the open window - being given the run around why we could not.  Okay, so maybe I'm sensitive, whatever.  
We order our drinks and hookah, I take the Noir wine and the Existential Octopus; it comes served at a balmy 80 degrees, on a warm summer night.  I'm not sure if some take their wine warm, but I do not.  I requested a Mango smoothie instead, to cool me off and sweeten up the smoke a bit - which even the smoothie was a little watered down.  The hookah on the other hand, was very smooth and satisfying.  We also ended up ordering the chicken shwarma, which was pretty tasty with warm pita.  
The bar itself is comfortable, however the music that was playing was kind of strange to me in this setting: mid to late 90s girl bands and pop.  Not sure how I felt about that one.
At the end of the night -  for the cost over satisfaction, I went away feeling somewhat let down.  This place could be great, I feel it was just slightly under good the night I visited.
