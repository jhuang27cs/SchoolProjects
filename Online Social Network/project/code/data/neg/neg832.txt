Not that great. 

About $5 a sandwich. Considering that $5-Foot-Longs Subway is right across the street, and the toaster oven's sandwiches are the same price but half the size, I expected a big increase in quality. Or at least a large increase in quality of bread, since the subway sandwiches are distinctively flimsy.

Not the case. I ordered the meatball sandwich. The bread was firm and chewy, and definitely better than subway's, but nothing to write home about, and not enough to warrant a return visit. The ingredients weren't amazing, the tomato tasted kinda bland, etc. Maybe a little better than subway's, but not by much.

Don't think I'll come back here, since Cheese N Stuff (lower Sproul on Campus) offers a cheaper price for a yummier (tho smaller) sandwich, and Subway offers a larger meal for the same price. Even the Dojo Dog place (food truck on Telegraph/Sproul) is better than this (fresh ingredients, amazing bread!)
