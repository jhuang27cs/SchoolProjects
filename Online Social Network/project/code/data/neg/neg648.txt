what a disappointment! i've had the sandwiches before from sidecar, but had yet to actually visit hillside because the 2 times i've come here, it was closed or had a "back in 15 min" note posted on the door. today i met a group of people here and when we showed up at 10:55 there was the damn note again. we all waited outside and then around 11:25 the woman finally opened the door, purse in hand, and said (i'm not kidding), "ok, you can come in now." um....really??? the hours of operation say you're open at 8am, you must be in a time warp because you were gone a lot longer than 15 minutes, and now you are GRACIOUSLY inviting us in to give you our hard earned money and help keep your business open?

ok, so i got past it, whatever. the food is mediocre at best, the coffee weak and tasteless, and the decor & signage made me feel like i was in some hole in the wall diner in the Central District. 

the final straw was that on their website it says buy one breakfast for $8.99 & up and receive a second breakfast for half off.  THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING! when i asked about it i was told they were doing that when they served breakfast on weekdays, but they don't do that anymore. 

good lord, get a grip. just because you serve mainly to college students who are just happy to get a vegan meal and will take any crap service & environment you dish out doesn't mean you can't be a decent establishment that caters to the rest of us.
