Lunch at Buca on a Sunday. No problem, no crowd.  Service was good and they kept on checking on us throughout the meal and brought us containers and extra bread to take home.

Small Margarita pizza, small chicken saltimbocca and small lasagna for three people and we were stuffed. Leftovers were worth two lunches the next day. 

My favorite was the pizza. It had a super thing crust. If you order a small for your meal you may be hungry later or it might not fill you up at all. 

Lasagna was ok and straightforward - meat sauce, noodles, cheese. Saltimbocca wasn't anything special - chicken breasts topped w/proscuitto (but not necessarily adding any flavor), plain artichoke hearts, capers and lemon sauce. The capers of course had flavors on their own, but the rest of it didn't do anything for me. 

I had a stomach ache from the lasagna or the saltimbocca. I'm not sure which one and my stomach can hold up to most food. Nobody else in my party did. And I ate the leftovers...repeat stomach ache.

Two stars and a half stars b/c I had a stomach ache and the price to value ratio is not optimal.
