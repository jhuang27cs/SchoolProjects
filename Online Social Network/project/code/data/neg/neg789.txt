I checked out the UCLA midwives after 3 GREAT recs from moms who'd had good experiences. Upon further reflection, all of these great experiences happened prior to 2004. It seems that that the practice may have changed since then.

I wanted to be with a midwife to gain all of the health experiences of someone who would not medicalize my pregnancy as a "condition" that needs to be "treated." At the time, I was wary of a homebirth, due to the culture of fear we perpetuate about healthcare in the US, & our tendency to place all of our power/responsibility for our own health into the hands of others we pay (doctors, etc.). In actuality, your chances of having a cesarian section increase by 30% simply by entering a hospital while you are laboring.

The UCLA outfit is a midwife/hospital hybrid. It's midwives who have had to drink the Kool-Aid of the legal department, placing quite a lot of focus on public health issues and less concern on the emotional security and well-being of the mother. In my experience.

If you are totally against birthing at home or in a birthing center, however, they might be worth checking out (as well as California Hospital, which also has midwives I think).

My experience with UCLA, during a 1-month pregnancy visit, which I used as my interview meeting with them:
--They don't offer any sort of free informational interview or meet-and-greet so you can decide if you want to use their services.
--They don't offer any birthing pools for you to float to ease labor, or deliver underwater. (They think waterbirth is "unusual.")
--They demanded I get a TB test and a (regular) flu shot before any health practitioner spoke with me (I declined the flu shot).
--Midwife focused on my maternal age and genetic testing, attempting to scare the bejeezus out of me and suggest my pregnancy was dangerous (I'm 40, and my pregnancy was not in any way dangerous).
--MW focused on diagnostic testing in terms of what I "must" do, and left out the part about how optional much of it is, that you can refuse.
--After explaining I wanted very limited ultrasound/Doppler exposure throughout the pregnancy, they immediately insisted on two back-to-back ultrasound tests, one of which was the higher-concern trans-vaginal type. I researched and these tests do not do anything to improve the outcome for the baby.
--MW could not explain why I "must" be tested for things that my family doesn't have a genetic history for.
--MW insisted I "must" take a test that she's "never seen a positive result" on, i.e., no one she has seen tested has to worry about that affliction.
--MW jammed my ear with the otoscope, which still hurt the next day.
--I was subjected to a "standard" physical exam and pap that left me feeling ookie the next day. Later I learned that many MWs do not perform such a test early in pregnancy to protect the baby.
--A lab tech walked in on my while I was doing a "clean catch" urine sample in the bathroom.
--I was not informed I would have to provide a second urine sample later in the appointment, and they did not give me the opportunity to provide urine for two tests at the same time.
--I was informed that any "soothing techniques" that could be offered by their outfit were provided only by a massage therapist (for a fee)...everything else you would provide (cd player, music, lights, etc.)
--I noticed that the first document in their folder full of information was not a welcome letter, a congratulations letter...but a flyer begging you to participate in a post partum depression study.
--I noticed that all of the literature promoting their new facilities focus on the hospital setting, not the comfort of the mother.

PROs at UCLA
*The baby can stay with you in your room after birth
*You are given ample time to ask questions
*Upon request, natural remedies for bacterial infections will be discussed
*Episiotomy rate appears to be quite low
*If you are pregnant beyond your 40th week (as measured by a vaginal ultrasound!), in general they don't freak out until week 42
*If you need to transfer to emergency medical care during labor, you are on site (no travel time).

Overall, at UCLA I did not feel that my experience as an expectant mother or as a client was valued (but their focus on running their business their way was).

More importantly, I did not feel that my desire for a natural, non-invasive pregnancy and delivery was valued, even though the MW observed, "you sound like a person who does not want to use a lot of medicine."

I ended up having an amazing, safe birth at HOME in a portable birthing pool with the support of two fantastic midwives from The Sanctuary / Sacred Entrance. I felt safe and confident, as we all welcomed my baby into a natural environment--as babies have been safely born for THOUSANDS of years. 

DO YOUR RESEARCH, no matter whom you choose. You have choices during this process, and the mainstream medical folk likely will "tell" you what to do, rather than  ask. Don't succumb to the culture of fear.
