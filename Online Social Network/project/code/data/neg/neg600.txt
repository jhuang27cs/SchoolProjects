I had the pho. It was raining as usual so what better than a big hearty steaming bowl of pho?

But when it came it was a miserable tiny portion. Undoubtedly the smallest bowl of pho I have ever eaten. Probably even the Vietnamese had bigger bowls while they were getting bombed by the US. 

It was in one of the gigantic plates with a little small depression in the middle where a tiny quantity of food may reside. 

There was of course no big heaping plate of bean sprouts and basil leaves and all the condiments that any Vietnamese person would know MUST accompany pho. 

And of course none of the usual "exotic" body parts that you'd find in any self-respecting restaurant claiming to serve pho (but I was not expecting this.)

My dining partner had the Ono Kautswaye and he was reasonably happy with it though. And the burgers and fries I saw others getting looked decent (and decently-sized). So maybe I was just lucky. Or dumb to try ordering pho in Ann Arbor.

(Redeeming factors: the service was good, so was ambience. The lunch menu is surprisingly affordable, though perhaps only because of the surprisingly teeny portion. So yea if you're on a diet and want to feel a little more royal than what you'd get most other places on Central Campus.)
