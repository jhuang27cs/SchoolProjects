I work around the corner from here so at least once a month something pulls me into Nussbaum either in the morning or at lunch (high traffic times). I like the bagels and desserts. But every time I go there I promise myself never to return. Their service is offensive. Thier prices will attack you if you are not ready. Only buy items that have posted prices and under no circumstances should you ask for a substitution. Once "Next!" is yelled at you - firmly place a short order. Then when the cashier yells "Next!" pay him/her and don't make eye contact.
