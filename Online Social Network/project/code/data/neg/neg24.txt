Minus 5 million points for the stupid name.

I swear, I was only there for Buckhunter.  [I don't even like Buckhunter].

As captured in the previous review, this place is not only not special, it's kind of bad.  And not awesome dive-bar bad.  18-and-unders sneaking drinks and over-40s leering creepily, this bar has everyone I'm trying to avoid in this town.  And all the food I don't want to eat, unseasoned.

They also get a nomination in the "worst bar bathroom" contest, which could appropriately be called a "water closet".  Make sure you're up-to-date on your vaccinations before venturing in there.
