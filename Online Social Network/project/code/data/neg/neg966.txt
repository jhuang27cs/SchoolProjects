Ugg! What happened to this place?! This used to be a regular haunt of mine a few years ago during frequent trips to Berkeley, but it has seriously gone down hill since then if my recent experience is any indication! I came here for a quick lunch on my most recent trip to Berkeley and found it to be filthy, smelly, and fly-ridden. It looks like nobody had bothered to clear tables in hours and there was nowhere clean to sit. The floor was sticky and covered in food, and there were flies landing on the discarded food piles around us. It was so disgusting that we left in a hurry, even though I thought I'd be OK with sitting at a dirty table. 

I really loved Cafe Intermezzo... I hope someone get this place to clean up their act soon!
