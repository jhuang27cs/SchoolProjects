Holy overpriced. 

Why is everything in there retail price or like higher than retail? Who is spending $400 on a Nicole Miller? Hello go to TJMAX.

What is with the blond girl that works in there?  Very odd. I can't decide if she is nice... she has never been rude to me but  I feel her judgment stare burning a hole in my soul.... my friend told me she went in there once and was casually looking at dresses and the blond girl told her that she had to pull the dresses out from the rack one by one to look at them. What? I'm not sure I understood her logic.

I really dislike this store for many reasons but mostly because it's trying to be something it's not...cool. I feel uncomfortable there and feel like I'm being judged...It's just expensive not GOD. The decor is nice and it is neatly organized and there are a couple dressing rooms as well. Totally not my cup of tea though. 

If you want to buy a dress and pay for 7 this is your kinda place...oh and forget returns cause they just don't do it.
