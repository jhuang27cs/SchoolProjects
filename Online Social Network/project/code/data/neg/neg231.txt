No.

I often tell people that I am so sad that this place is as popular as it is because people will come to think that this is actually what Indian food tastes like.

No.  Just don't go here, especially if you're trying Indian food for the first time. Please.  It will taint your opinion of Indian food.

I've been here twice.  I went the second time because I was sure that they were having an off-day the first time I went.  To my disappointment, I was wrong.  They really were just that bad.

The service was bad, the place was dirty (though, I think they have tidied up a bit since when I last went), the food was not good (not representative of Indian food and also just not tasty), and the wait was really long.

I will give it this: 1. The naan is good (but that's a given at an Indian restaurant), and 2. The chai was good (but also a given).

Otherwise, no. No. No. No.
