Plain and simple, the food sucked.  Artichoke Fritters didn't taste fresh and were soggy and dense.  

The predominant flavor of the burgers (sliders) was bread.  The bread was OK, but the meat and cheese were pretty flavorless.  We were ordered it cooked medium but came out well done (as in cooked more than we wanted, not well executed).  

The crab cakes were just bad and they only gave me two little ones.  The tasted like they could have been frozen.  I guess the french fries were good, but you are really screwed if you mess up french fries in the a restaurant.  

I've had better food at EVK.  And the place closes at 11:00 so it's not really a bar either. 


But there are a few good things:
Maybe it's a little over done, but I think the design is great. They must have spent a fortune putting it together - marble and slate tabletops, custom plates and glasses.  top notch look.  But, I'd rather eat in a dungeon if the food is good than a palace if it sucks.  

Drink prices are fantastic and selection is good.  They had my favorite beer on tap (a rare-ish micro brew - Green Flash IPA) for only $5.   

Go for the drinks, not the food (as long as you don't plan on staying past 11:00)
