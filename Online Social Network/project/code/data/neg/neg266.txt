Good for all you can eat sushi.
Bad for tastiness.  

Sushi Star has a pretty good menu (but it lacks crucial details like what is inside their maki...what's a "hamilton roll"?), but quantity is their strength, not quality.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  

Go with friends - it's fun and pretty good if you want to eat a lot of sushi, but don't expect the best eating experience of your day.
