This is not the best tapioca in town but it is open late and is fairly cheap. The service is usually bad. I dig the milk tea, The food isn't very good and it seems like food orders confuse them becuase they have mixed my orders up twice when I have been there. It is small and crowded but I always get my drinks to go.
