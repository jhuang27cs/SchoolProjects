More bark than bite?

Based on one recent visit, and $30+ for two sandwiches, I have to say I'm a bit stumped by how seemingly entrenched this eatery's popularity is.  They get points for eclectic charm, brazen help behind the counter (it's hard to squeeze in there to wait in line for a sandwich without being hustled to try some cheeses--note that this is NOT a bad thing) and genuinely high-quality spreads, jams, meats, and cheeses--but the meat and cheese selection is more spartan than many markets I frequent (maybe my expectations are too high?) and everything seems a bit on the pricey side (I would have preferred a $10 price for the food, if even that much).

I got a soggy, lukewarm Reuben with plentiful moist yet somewhat tasteless beef--the dressing was good, I guess, but even the sauerkraut lacked punch.  The three things that make a good rueben are temperature, zing, and bread--they got 2 out of 3 wrong (the bread was alright but not great).  Getting in and out was a bit confusing (order here after waiting in a disorganized line that was a bit more like bidding on a head of steer at a rodeo auction, pay in the other room, go into the building next door to get a drink, find a table outside and we'll bring food to you--yikes!).

Not a bad meal, mind you, and I'll go back (especially if I'm in need of a hunk of Cotswold to tide me over) but given the price, result, and byzantine method of queuing, ordering, purchasing, then connecting with the pricey mediocre food have me thinking I will be looking for other deli selections for more variety as a higher priority.
