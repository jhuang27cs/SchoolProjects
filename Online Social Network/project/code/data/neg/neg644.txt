These guys are nothing but a scam rip off.  While traveling on business the water heater at my wofes hair salon went down.. Catastrophe right??  Wasn't half as bad as the "service" we got from these rodeo clowns.   They show up..and it sounds like they found the unit just turned off...  Then they proceed to tell us we need a new pump or its not gonna work yadda yadda yadda...  Talking real loud in front of our clients about the "HAZZARD" it was presenting and how they "wouldnt be responsible when the water leaks"  The damn thing was just turned off!!   Stay FAR away from these rip offs!
