Horrible service.
LONG ass waiting times.

This is not the place to go for a quick meal or even quick to-go.

The food is decent, but they keep hiking up the prices and they aren't courteous to the customers. So it's NOT worth it.

I dined there a couple times and even did takeout. Takeout took incredibly long. Over 50 mins. I called in, they said 20 mins. I came after 20 mins and 30 min later, I still didnt have my order. So I left. 

They weren't even busy, while the two korean waiters were giggling behind the counter talking about sneaking some plum wine... I should know, I'm korean and they were speaking in korean....

Haven't been back since, and I tell everyone I know not to go there.

Go somewhere else.
