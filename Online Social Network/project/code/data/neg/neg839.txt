I just went here last night and it was the nastiest food I have ever eaten.  The last time I visited Azuma was 5 years and it has gone down the drain since then.  The agedashi tofu tasted like it was fried in the morning and sat there all day.  It wasn't crispy, it was chewy. We also ordered the caterpillar and spider rolls.  It was all rice and no fish.  Lastly we ended with the kobe beef and beef tongue from the robata grill.  Both came out at room temperature so I think these were cooked in the morning too!  So disappointed and will never ever return.  There are so many other wonderful restaurants...don't waste your money here.
