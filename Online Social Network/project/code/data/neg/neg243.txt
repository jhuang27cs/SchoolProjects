I have heard about this place...stuck downtown last week during traffic...so I decide to give it a shot....I get the two meat plate so I can try more than one meat...I get that and order a soda....$17....really...$17!?!?!?!?!?! Pre-Katrina New Orleans you get a hooker with knee pads for $17!!! Anyways....i ordered thr turkey and sausage...with bbq beans and mashed potatoes....well the dr. pepper was good!!!!!! the turkey was almost undercooked...chewy turkey is not good,...the beans were ok...nothing special...and the taters had as much flavor as cardboard...the sausage was pretty good...but it was Elgin Sausage....so that means all they did was heat up someone else's sausage (my mind suddenly drifts back to New Orleans)...did i really just say 'heat up someone else's sausage?"   the bbq here was by far the worst i have ever had, over priced and service blew. (but not like pre-katrina) ha
