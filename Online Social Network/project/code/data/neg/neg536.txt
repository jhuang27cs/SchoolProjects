The beer and wine were pedestrian and fine. I liked the subway tile on the walls but the place is too cold (close those doors), too white and too uncomfortable. I m writing this cause the food is dangerously sucky as well. They served me 2 "rare" pork chops (bloody in the middle) and when I complained the waiter tried to convince me It was my fault for not telling him I wanted it well done! "if I wanted it well down I should have said so" cause he's used to serving it that way to people??? HUH, really? After I found out it was owned by USC I regret not complaining of boccelism later, because usc = deep pockets.... The whole thing just stunk of raw pork. Regretfully even the bread pudding sucked. IT was over microwaved and chewy hot bread wuz dry. GET a clue lab. You're like the government. Institutional, Not going away, not getting fired, not giving a rats patootie. Equals NO CUSTOMERS.
