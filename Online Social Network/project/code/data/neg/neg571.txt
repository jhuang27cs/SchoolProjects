I had gone there a few times and after the last experience, never went back. After getting our meals on a quite Saturday afternoon, we realized we had no silverware. We waited almost 10 minutes without our waiter to be found. I went to the hostess station and asked if she could give us 2 sets of silverware. She said she couldn't and said I had to wait for the server. I told her we had been waiting for 10 minutes. She still wouldn't get silverware. I asked for a manager. When I said our food was cold and we couldn't get silverware and our waiter was not around, the manager got us silverware and said, "the waiter is busy,"  as if we were an inconvenience. Are you kidding me, busy doing what? You mostly serve yourself.
