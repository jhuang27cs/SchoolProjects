Went on a Wednesday for Womp, or whatever. I'm not a huge fan of electronic music, but I thought, "Why not? They allow ins and outs and I want some goddamn Top Dog around 11pm."

The line to get in was ridiculously long, though I'm not surprised because it was 18+. A bunch of kids wearing plastic beads and furry boots isn't exactly my scene, but once again I said to myself why the fuck not?

And, well, after saying that at least twenty times to myself I devised a list of reasons of why I'll never return:
The "bouncers" are total dicks. They say they allow ins and outs, but they hassle the crap out of you when you try to get back in. The same guy who saw me walk out with my wristband visible, I showed him because I didn't know when I had to confirm the fact I paid $5 to get groped, ended up freaking out because my wristband situated itself under my sleeve.
Someone got stabbed in the head. I frequent the Tenderloin so I suppose this shouldn't surprise me, but for Christ's sakes I'm on Telegraph with a bunch of Cal kids smoking American Spirits.
The crowd was lame, for lack of a better word. I think I'll just wait to go to bars and clubs when i'm actually 21.

However, the beer selection looked good! It's not like a drank anything, but I was definitely creeping on the bar.
