I really wanted to like this place. My friend and I asked the bartender for recommendations and were disappointed. We ordered the Lamb Cheeks and they were fatty and the food was under salted and the gemolata was overwhelming. Wanted to still give this place a try so we ordered the Carrot Cake. We were disappointed when we received a "deconstructed" cake - 2 triangular slabs of semi-dry cake with a dollup of cream cheese frosting. They need to warn people that it is not your standard cake (which is what I was craving).

They really did try though. They took off the dessert, gave us some free glasses of Prosecco and some dry cookies (peanut butter, which is ironic given the Peanut Butter scare).

I will try it again in hopes of a better experience. Do realize they are new.
