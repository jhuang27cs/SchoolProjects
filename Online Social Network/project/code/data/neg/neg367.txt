Mehhh. I don't know about this place.  I was kind of excited to try it because of all the good reviews, one of them being my friends that I always enjoy eating with and have pretty similar tastes in.  

The only good thing about this place was that the na'an was fresh and I guess because I love watermelon and I ate a shit ton of them there.  

Every single curry that was there was wayyyyyy too watery for anyone's good.  I had to put rice under them just so it wouldn't spread and mix.  If I didn't, I'd probably have to put only one curry on one plate.  The flavors were so so as well.  The spinach one was missing something because normally it's my faveeee but I had one bite of it and just stopped.  

The chicken was pretty dry and flavorless as well.  I just took the drumsticks and dunked pieces of the chicken in curry.  

One star for the price, one star for the naan but I'll probably not go there again unless it's the only thing open. Now I'm on my way to kick my friend in the face for believing his review.
