The portions they serve here are small. I knew it wasnt just me when I saw 2 other customers behind me ask for more rice. And even after a request for more rice., the manager barely served more. I have had a better experience at other Chipotle locations ( like the one close to El Camino and Page mill as the other reviewer has pointed out ). I will not come back here again.
