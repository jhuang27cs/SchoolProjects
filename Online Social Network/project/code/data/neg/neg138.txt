Me and my girls are big pizza eaters and huge fans of Pauline's in SF. Howie's pizza was not good. The crust was soft and mushy and the pizza was too cheesy. We were not impressed at all. The place itself is nice, good service, the salad was pretty good, but you come to an "artisan" pizza place for delicious pizza and Howie's didn't deliver.
