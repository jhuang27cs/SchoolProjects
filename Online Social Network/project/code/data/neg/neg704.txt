This spot is overrated. I came here for a goodbye party and I was expecting some great Asian fusion. The rolls were interesting but the flavors didn't marry well. not to mention the parking sucks. Its a trendy and cute idea for a restaurant with nice decor and atmosphere but the food doesn't leave one feeling fulfilled. I wouldn't come back here unless someone decides to have their shindig here again.
