Yum...cupcakes

But does it really have to be so expensive?  $3.25 for a regular size cupcake.  yikes.  I tried their best seller, chocolate velvet.  I appreciated the moderate sweetness of the chocolate buttercream.  However, the cupcake itself was on the dry, crumbly side.  Don't know if it was just bad luck or that's the consistency of their cupcakes.

Overrated.  The end.
