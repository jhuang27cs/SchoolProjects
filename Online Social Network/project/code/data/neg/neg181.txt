I have had a couple good experiences with the Tang Center, but for the most part it has been pretty bad. For one, never expect your appointment to ever start on time. It isn't rare for a patient to wait up to an hour after the appointment time to see the doctor. Another problem is simply that the doctors really don't care from what I have seen. Finally even making an appointment can take forever, since no one answers the phone and the drop in advise nurse always takes a while. All of this could have been forgiven however, if it wasn't for my particularly bad experience this last week.

I have a nasal infection. A bacterial nasal infection. Right now I have had it for over 3 weeks and have been to the Tang Center 4 times and they still won't concede its anything but  a minor cold. I made an appointment, doctor said I should rest and it should go away. Saw an advice nurse, twice! She said it was probably allergies. I told her I have every single symtom of a nasal infection and that I need amoxicillin, she said im not a doctor. Go to the ER since its been over three weeks, i am incredible congested, have a constant headache, and I am going home to see my family and my father recently recovered from cancer (thus has a extremely vunerable immune system) and didn't want to infect him, wait for over 2 hours, and all the advice nurse said was that i need to take sudafed and rest. I tell her thats all ive been doing, may i see a doctor, and she says i shouldn't go to the ER for minor colds, and that it would be over in a day or 2. now my whole family is sick, its been over 3 weeks, and I am still feeling miserable with midterms right around the corner. the tang center is terrible, sorry for the rant.
