The dim sum is really oily and the fried food tastes way too fried. If something sounds vegetarian from the description, be sure to ask to make sure, because some things had little random bits of meat (I think for flavor). Also, some of the fried vegetarian things tasted like the oil used to fry them had also been used for fish. Getting something "steamed" is not a guarantee that it will taste healthy.

Food gets one star. I'm adding another because the service was okay.
