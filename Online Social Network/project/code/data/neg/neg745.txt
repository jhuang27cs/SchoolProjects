Salad and pastas, with some sandwiches and soup added later to spice up the menu.

The original owners back in 1998-2000 were great - they had a flying fast business, low prices, and generous portions of toppings for salads and pasta. His sons worked there along side him and his wife took the till. It was a fun place to come, chat, and be around.

Then an ownership change totally clobbered the surrounding students with a price hike, and even the staff was taken a-back. The bread given with the pasta and salad was smaller and all seemed less friendly. The new soups & sandwiches probably helped save this place, but the crowds are much thinner.

The turkey club salad is good, with ranch, and pasta w/ white sauce is good, too, although I've found remnants of shells? or something in it before. Gia Pronto's opening probably took away some business, too.
