I want to preface this review by saying that I didn't get to try any of the food here, so the 1 star is based purely on service. Also, this review involves space/3d (which I'm bad at writing about) and so may be annoying to read - sorry! But I just had to yelp this totally bizarre experience!
We came in (a Weds) to a pretty much empty restaurant (i think a total of 4 customers) and were ushered to a cramped table. Since the table was less than a foot away from one of the occupied tables on one side, and about 3 feet from the (empty table) behind it, I asked my boyfriend if he could push the table back a few inches. He did, and without moving his chair (therefore the setup hadn't changed - he just had less room between him and the table). Immediately one of the waitresses came by and started fussing about it, and then finally said "ok, for now you can stay that way but you may have to move." We stayed very still and started to read the menu and she came up AGAIN and said to me "there's room behind you, could you move your chair back so that you're farther away from the table" even though my chair was nearly touching the chair behind it! All so strange, we couldn't respond. Just got up and left.
