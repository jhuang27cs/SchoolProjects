To start with they don't have any vegetarian options, except stew of veggie which is not good at all. I have eaten Persian food a lot and I know they have so many vegetarian dishes. The service is good though (that's why I am giving it 2 stars). The food you get for your money is not worth and not enough either. I'll accept small portion for a quality but Alborz doesn't have either.
