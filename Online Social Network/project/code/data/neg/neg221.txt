Small, hot rooms with no A/C.  Even an open window offers no relief.  This is November 3, 2010.  It's currently 64 degrees outside and the room is over 80 degrees.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone if they expect a good night of sleep.  However, the front desk staff is nice.  But the hotel itself is old, dirty and the rooms are HOT on a cold night.
