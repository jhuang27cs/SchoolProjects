This is basically The Connection's bar annex.  They even share the same kitchen, but they go through lengths to hide that fact.  The food they serve is absolutely horrendous.  Remember those heady days of freshman year when you decided to "cook" for yourself?  Remember how you made some quesadillas by tossing shredded cheddar between a supermarket tortilla, folding it over, and toasting it with your brand new clothes iron?  Charge $10+ for it, and that's what you're getting at Loco.

The drinks aren't really much better.  The bartenders seems largely clueless and inconsistent.  My first margarita tasted nothing like my second, in flavor or in strength.  My friend's mojitos tasted great on the first round, and like a thin slightly sugary glass of water on the next.  And it's not exactly cheap.
