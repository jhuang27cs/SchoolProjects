WOW this place was awful. I'm usually a fan of Chipotle and I figure it must have been something to do with the all-new staff that comes with an all-new location. No less than five people handled my burrito and not one of them knew what to do with it, except maybe the guy at the tortilla steamer. I ended up with a burrito that was literally cold. Poorly wrapped as well, but the awful part was the chilliness. Jesus. I don't know if it was due to the excessive amounts of salsa or inadequate heating of the ingredients, but this burrito was frigid and nasty. I don't know why I even went here in the first place, considering the alternatives in the neighborhood.
