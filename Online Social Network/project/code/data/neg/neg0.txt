As a vegan, I try to support places that are not wholly vegetarian, but that made the effort to put a vegetarian section on their menu, to show them that it's worth keeping. Thai Singha House does indeed have a section of their menu that reads vegetarian, but, unfortunately, their definition of vegetarian is different from mine.

All of the vegetarian curries, I was fortunately informed upon asking, do indeed contain fish sauce, which is an ingredient in the curry itself, and cannot be omitted.

My server suggested the pad thai as a fish-free vegetarian alternative, which I ordered, holding the egg. When it arrived, there appeared to be tofu in there and no egg, which was a good sign. But after a few blind, trusting bites I quickly realized that there was also chicken or pork mixed in as well. My server graciously took it back and honored my request for a house salad, of which I wasn't charged.

I don't blame Thai Singha House for not understanding the definition of vegetarian (sadly, I know a few "vegetarians" who just don't eat red meat) although there are non-vegetarian Thai restaurants that get it and get it right, like Tamarind on South Street. 

So, it's up to us as consumers to ask questions beforehand if we're not totally sure. And this is probably wise at any place where there is an ethnic and language barrier (On a related note, don't be fooled into thinking you can get vegan pho in Philly. It does not exist. You're eating beef broth or non-pho water broth, but not pho made with vegetable stock.)
