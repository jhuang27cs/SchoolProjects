The Number 1 bus is the most statistically robust vector for the transmission of tuberbulosis in the City of  Boston. I have this on good authority from the Public Health Commission.

Now a good friend has contracted H1N1 influenza from the same bus because some highly irresponsible sick person was coughing and sneezing in that urban American way, and the bus ride inched along for 30 minutes longer than it should. People, didn't any of you see 'Outbreak'?

Don't take that bus if you can avoid it. Bring an N95 rated respirator. And alcohol wipes. 

FAIL.
