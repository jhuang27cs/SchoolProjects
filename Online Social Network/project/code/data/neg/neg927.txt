Another Americanized Chinese restaurant in College Park. The food quality has gone down. I guess it's okay if you're a student because its location is convenient, and they are open late. 

The portion is decent, but the food is bland and you're probably not going to finish it all. Heck, Panda Express on Campus is better than this. Don't bother going if you're just visiting CP because you will be surely disappointed.
