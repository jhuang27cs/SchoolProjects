I'm amazed at how bad  the customer service is here.  I would have assumed that anyone who works at a shipping store would consider it his job to help people ship things.  Guess I'm kind of naive. Guy seemed REALLY annoyed that I wanted to ship something, kept trying to find reasons why I couldn't ship them.  (such as no packaging large enough for a 350-page document, then really annoyed when I pointed out large- enough packaging,) Then, when upon leaving I double-checked that the package would arrive overnight, the guy shrugged.  When I gave him the evil eye, he shrugged again and said "yeah" 

Hope he didn't toss it in the trash.  

Advice: use fedex instead
