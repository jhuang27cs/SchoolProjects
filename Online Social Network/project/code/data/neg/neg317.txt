The Stand claims they have never had any health violations, but then I don't see why a member of the Health Department would tell us that they went and inspected the place and found things (I believe one of the things he said was that the grills were not hot enough) if they didn't..  Even if that individual did misreport things to us, the way the Stand's staff treated us when we were just trying to warn them is completely unacceptable.  A simple "thank you.  we'll look into that" would have been fine.  A surly response and being accused of lying by the staff (and now the manager)? Not fine.  Hopefully, a down economy weeds out businesses like this with crappy customer service.
