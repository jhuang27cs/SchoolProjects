SERIOUSLY PEOPLE.  I mean, in a city with a campus known for it's crush of intelligent people, this bagel shop has got a lot to learn.  I have a meeting on the Berkeley campus at 10:30 am on a Saturday, arrive at 10:15 am, think I have time to stop and get a bagel.  25 minutes later....with a burnt tongue.  The shop was severely understaffed and those that were working moved at the speed of gigantic sloths.  The manager didn't bat and eyelash when the workers messed up a total of three orders before mine, I mean, she actually smirked when one of her workers gave a woman lip for complaining that she didn't want meat on her bagel. Then, she made me my latte after about 20 minutes.  First sip, scalded my tongue, I mean, in a dangerous scary way.  This place is the WORST ever.  I mean, wow, how do you fuck up smearing cream cheese on a bagel?
