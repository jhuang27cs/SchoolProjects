Oh my goodness, this is a scary place.  While eating, cockroaches were scurrying across the wall right next to the table I was eating at.  I got so disgusted that I finally had to kill it myself.  I mentioned it to the cashier and she just shrugged her shoulders.

As far as the food goes, the terrikyaki sauce they use is literally the worst sauce I have EVER had.  I guess that they think that if you're a student, you won't care enough, that you'll just wolf it down and move on.

All in all, a terrible place and it's too bad.  While other reviewers say their portions are large, it's not an excuse to have cockroaches running around your restaurant@!
