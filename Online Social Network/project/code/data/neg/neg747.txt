The food is typical bar food; nothing spectacular; but if you are a fan of bar eats then this is the place for you.The tobacco smoke is offensive and at times overwhelming to those of us who do not smoke. I've been twice and both times for only a short period of time and had to come home and peel my clothes off and shower to not smell like a smoke filled room. Again, if you are smoker, then this isn't an issue.
