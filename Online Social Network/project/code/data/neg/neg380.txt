I'm surprised this place has so many good reviews...

I grew up in Georgia and have lived in Boston for the last 3 years.  I just moved to Lafayette and was excited to get some good barbeque.  The pulled pork was decent and the sauces were very good but the sides that I tried were pretty awful and not what I would consider good barbeque.  To me, a good barbeque joint is not only about the meats but also the fixins and sides.

The Brunswick stew in particular was pathetic. Hands down the worst Brunswick stew I have ever tasted.  It was not the delicious tomato-based, meaty stew I was raised on.  Instead, it resembled soggy bland mashed potatoes with a can of veg-all thrown in.  Flavor less, bland, and mushy.  Ew.  The greens were also nothing to write home about.  No spice, just plain boiled greens.  Not seasoned and bland. The potato salad went overboard on the vinegar (should have used some in the greens)

I rated this 2 stars because the meat was prepared well, although the portions were very small.  The quality of the meat and the sauce are the only reason this doesn't get 1 star.  I probably wouldn't eat here again.

Honestly (and I never thought I'd say this) they had better barbeque in Massachusetts....
