I would give this place negative stars if there that was a choice. I was there last week and I happen to sit at the corner and there were tons of cockroaches on the wall!! My friend and I automatically jumped when we noticed them! we moved to a different table and then started paying attention and noticed a lot more on the wall next to us!! The ridiculous part is that the waiter felt bad so he took off the price of my Thai iced tea!! I told him i'm going to write numerous reviews online about this... but I don't think he had a clue what I was talking about! People, do your health a favor and don't go there... it looks all fun and everything with the fire part, but you have no idea what you're putting down your throats! hmm, who else thinks like this?
