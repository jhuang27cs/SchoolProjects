At first I loved the store like all the other people that have reviewed this. Mary was super nice and I would frequently visit the store. However this one time I bought a purse from the store that was slightly pricier than the other items; I loved the purse though and was excited about using it. But right when I got home I found out that the buckle on the purse had fell off, and the purse had basically fallen apart. I took it back to the store hoping that I could maybe do a return and get store credit. But no! Mary was a completely different person and assumed that I broke it and wanted money back even though I explained to her that the product was defective. I am pretty sure that she remembers me because I used to go there a lot and always praised her store. Her change in attitude really disappointed me and now I refuse to shop there. She is nice until something happens to your purchase...
