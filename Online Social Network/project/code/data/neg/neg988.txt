For a place that proclaims to specialize in noodles from their name, this place really isn't very impressive. It's not that their food is terrible but you can definitely find several better alternatives elsewhere. They do have a wide variety of noodles though, I'll give them that. If anything, I'd recommend their Thai style noodles over the others.
