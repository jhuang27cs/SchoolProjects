This 1-star review is for the service, as I didn't get to actually try the food.

My husband and I walked into this place about 40 minutes before it was scheduled to close on Saturday night. We asked the hostess/waitress at the front if we had time to eat, and she said we did as long as we ordered relatively quickly. We were ok with that, so we decided to take a seat.

This same waitress brought us water, then proceeded to literally hover right over the table as we glanced through the menu. She then told us we could only order from the kitchen (no sushi or shabu shabu) because they were closing soon. Ok lady, we get it! 

Not 30 seconds later, she demanded we order because the cook is going home soon. Seriously? We were at the table no more than 2 minutes, and there was more than half an hour until closing time. It was at that point that we got up and left.

I understand when staff wants to clean up and go home, but don't stand over your customers like you're a prison warden. We were made to feel extremely uncomfortable, and will certainly not be going back there.
