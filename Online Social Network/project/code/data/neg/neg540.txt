Way too expensive. I like their coffee though and at $2.00 for a medium the price point is pretty equal with other places. BUT $2 for a bagel? Give me a freakin' break. Pre-made salad is $6 (if you want protein on it, that'll be at least $1 more). Staff is always rushing around/in the way of customers/not friendly. 8 oz greek yogurt? $3. Avocado? $2 Apple? $2 Ridiculous. Buy only your coffee here.
