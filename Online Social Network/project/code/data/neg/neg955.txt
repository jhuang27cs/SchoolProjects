Con: no rollaway beds even after requesting it 5 days in advance. There are only two in the entire complex of 50 or so rooms. Business center is a profit center with $3 min charge on credit card...
small parking spaces. Carpet's sticky and queen beds are really twin beds. 

Pro: cleaning staff members are nice people..
