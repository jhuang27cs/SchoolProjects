I'm very hot and cold on this place.  Their prices are a little heart stopping.  It should be rated $$$ not $$.  My wife and I shared one appetizer, one main dish, some white rice and a couple beers and our total with tip was $40.  Ouch.

Still, we liked the ambiance, the service was fairly attentive, and the saag aloo tikki appetizer was PHENOMENAL.  Lightly fried, very fresh, flavors well balanced with the mint chutney, I highly recommend it.  After that the Rogan Josh lamb main dish was a total letdown.  While it was carefully prepared, it utterly lacked character - an $8 dish they charge $17 for.  It desperately needed a vegetable side, but we were already over budget.  

I don't mind spending $$$ on food, but it had better be justified.  Aside from the appetizer, Tamarind Bay just doesn't offer much value.
