I read the reviews here and I was excited for something pretty special. Not too fancy, but some good solid flavors. I was disappointed.

The pork buns were 95% pure fat, without exaggeration. I'm no expert, but I've had a few pork bellies in my day. The buns each had a 2x3 inch square of pure fat. There wasn't even a strip of meat down one side. One bun had a piece of meat on the corner. The total actual pork was smaller than the last knuckle on my pinkie.

The butter corn ramen was also disappointing. The broth was totally bland. There was a nice flavor in the mushrooms, but otherwise it was totally lacking. My friend also got the corn ramen and was likewise disappointed, and he had the advantage of smoking out before dinner.

The service was great, though.
