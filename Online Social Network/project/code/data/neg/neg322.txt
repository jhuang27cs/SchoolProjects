I waited for 45 minutes for my food. The frist time they messed up my order so I waited for an extra 10 minutes. It was not until I was home that I found out that they gave me the same WRONG order. The food from this place is bad and I would preter McDonald's any day, which is much cheaper and tastier. Not going to this place again.
