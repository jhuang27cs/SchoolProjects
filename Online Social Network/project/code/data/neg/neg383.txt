Excruciatingly small servings. Even after ordering 4 tapas apiece, we were still hungry. While the miniscule helpings of various dishes were tasty,  we all left the place still hungry. Very poor value for the money. Substandard service...food delivery from ktichen was very slow, and the waitperson was confused and ill-informed.  Never again.
