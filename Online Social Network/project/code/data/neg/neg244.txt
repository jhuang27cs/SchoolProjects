First of all --these sandwiches taste like nothing. OK, they taste like fattening mayo and dull, crunchy iceburg lettuce. This to me is the epitome of bland American fare.... no culinary flare whatsoever and so unhealthy for you. 

It's a shame that people can't find a more delicious sandwich option in town. We have so many! If the only reason you like this place is because it's fast... then I'm sorry.
