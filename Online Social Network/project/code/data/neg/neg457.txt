This spot is so hidden, you would almost miss it except for the two valet parking attendants that sit outside. The place sits in between two of the more pouplar bars in Providence especially in the summer since it is located right on the water/marina in downtown Providence. The problem here is that this trying to be trendy bar is way out of place here. The outside of the place looks like a run down house. Inside you will be shocked to see a lit up wall behind the bar and Soho decorated interior with cheap trendy furniture. The place looks like it is trying to be something out of Sex and the City. Too bad it is in downtown Providence. The staff here thinks they are above working there and better than the customers that frequent this place. The customer base is young professionals that think they are in Soho sipping $15 martinis and thinking they are somebody. The weird part here is that when you venture upstairs, it is like two different places with an open room that looks like it belongs in a church hall rather than some place like this. the prices oare outrageous and the place is just downright worthless. Skip it and try the other two spots on this road which are casual and you can grab a drink and not pay more than $10 for it!
