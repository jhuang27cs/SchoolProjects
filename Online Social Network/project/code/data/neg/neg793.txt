If you're looking for mediocre coffee at expensive prices - this is your place! You'd be better off at the Starbucks around the corner.

While the atmosphere is still the same as I remember - easy to read or study, this shop has definitely gone down in quality since I went to Princeton and lived in the area years ago. I've been to coffee shops across the country and have a good sense of quality. The latte I ordered was not much better than drip coffee with milk poured in - certainly the "barista" knew nothing of her job.
