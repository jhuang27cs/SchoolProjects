The food was very good, but service was excruciatingly slow and waitstaff unhelpful when it's possible to find them. The problem may be management, communication or the kitchen. Waitstaff disappeared from a nearly empty mid-week restaurant to hide from frustrated and increasingly irritated customers (I was not the only one).

For example, the desserts are made to order - and exceptionally good. Expect at least a 30 minute wait. If the menu or waitstaff had SAID that, and suggested ordering dessert with your main course, that would have been fine.

As it is, only go there with a lot of free time, lots to talk about (or a book). Treat arrival of each course or glimpse of waitstaff as an unpredictable surprise. I literally had to chase down the waiter to get a check. Very unpleasant - he looked embarrassed.

 A shame because although the food was enjoyable, I'm very unlikely to return or recommend it.
