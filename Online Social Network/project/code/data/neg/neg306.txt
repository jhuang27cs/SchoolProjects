Burgers were sub par, over-cooked and small for price. Veggie burger is not a patty but rather a bunch of weird vegetables and rice. Onion strings had nice seasoning but were too mushy. Beer selection is good and there's some expensive but delicious-sounding desert shakes. I will not go back for food, but possibly drinks.
