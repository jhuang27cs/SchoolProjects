The dishes here are typical. Nothing over the top. Cash only so be prepared. Their portions are generous, but their taste is just the usual boring taste that I'd rather drive to Korea town where I know I'll be taken care of. But if you're stick in Westwood and am craving some thai cuisine, stick to this restaurant. They bring you a huge menu with endless amounts of dishes to choose from. You're bound to find something that'll satisfy you. 

Be warned: Their boba menu is beyond mediocre, and last time I ordered their boba, it was so mushy, it melted as soon as it hit the tongue. (gross).

Bathroom: 2/5.
