Why, Delilah, won't you make your kitchen staff wear hair nets?

I've been three times. The 1st time I found hair in my mac, I calmly let them know about the problem. Same with the second. Figuring the problem had been rectified, I tried a third time and failed. Yes, folks, hair again, and no it wasn't mine. I didn't think lightening could strike 3 times, but I'm living proof.

Maybe I could find the food delicious if I could get it sans hair. Avoid her venues like the plague, people!
