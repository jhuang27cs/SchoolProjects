I'll give it 2.5 stars...just OK, but could be a bit better. Comfy and cozy, yes it is, unless you are destined to one of the few tables that constitute "Siberia", (exposed to way too much wait staff traffic and brush by) as we almost were on this particular evening. We had a reservation, for God's sake, so I do not understand. This is a table that should only be delegated to the unwashed masses that appear at the door without fore thought. Luckily, the hostess was astute enough to sense my displeasure at the impending table assignment, so she offered an optional solution that required us only to wait about 15 minutes for one of those comfy booths to open up. Um, OK, more time to savor a martini or two. Credit to the hostess.

Service was adequate, not great. Menu selection is typical Grill fare, with not much imagination. I had a rib eye steak that was just OK, but cost $28. Short ribs were ordered next to me and they were kind of...boring. Shrimp cocktail was good. Salad was OK. Don't remember too much else... 

If you are not into drinking, which I am (to be clear, I mean that I am into drinking...) I would imagine that these kind of places don't always satisfy. In other words, the cozy comfort factor is inversely related to your sobriety...the more you drink, the more you will like this place. Need I say more ?
