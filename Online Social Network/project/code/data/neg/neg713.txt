This is a review of the nightclub. The atmosphere in Om is quite nice--the lighting is pleasant and the room has a pleasant modern feel. But the compliments stop there. The music is somewhere between top 40 and techno, but the DJs are uninventive with beats and the music therefore feels repetitive.  The dancefloors are exceedingly narrow, making for an unpleasant dancing experience and easy violations of personal space. On a final note, the bouncers are too laid back about allowing drunken males searching for a brawl and smacking ladies' behinds unsolicited to remain on the floor. To sum up this place in one word, I'd go with "sketch." Take it from someone who has enjoyed sketchy places around the world: this one you should just avoid.
