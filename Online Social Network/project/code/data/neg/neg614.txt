Over fifteen years ago I went to Grendel for fondue. It was a good time A, because I had never had fondue B, because I was 17. Now that I am old and the wonder of trying hot stinky cheese on skewered bread has passed I realize it wasn't that cool being the food has gotten drastically weak. While the burgers are quite fine and actually my friend was given a double burger rather than a single, it still points out that the cooks are either not paying attention or don't care. My seafood platters haddock looked like a scaled guppy, the scallops and shrimps were fine tho. This now leaves my memories of the fondue which were shattered when I tried the abrasively over wined sharp flavor... It tasted less like fine cheese and more like cheese whiz dunked in boxed wine. The wait staff was cool a nice but seem way disinterested in keeping up appearances. About three were all sitting at the bar reading when i was there. I didn't even realize they were staff until later. At best Grendel is a decent place to get a beer these days and strait bar food but outside of that your taking you life and taste buds in your own hands.
