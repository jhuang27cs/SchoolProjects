I thought we'd just caught Viva Madrid on an off-night, but based on what friends have told us since, I doubt it. I've had tapas food in multiple cities around the U.S., and I've lived and traveled in Spain as well. The food here is sub-par. Some dishes, like what should be a flagship, the tortilla espanola, were ok, but not exceptional. Our waitress (we were seated at the bar) was also clearly not interested in us. I would not recommend this restaurant, even if the ambiance is fantastic. Hopefully they'll improve rather than go under - Claremont needs a tapas place!
