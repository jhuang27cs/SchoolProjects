I hate to do this...it is another bad review of the Harvest Bar. You might think that after the last review I posted a year ago, we wouldn't go back. But we did. Twice. And the experience was almost identical each time. 

The problem is the bartender. The guy is just not up to snuff for a place like this. 

He spends time talking to his friends and acquaintances about his own personal life and neglects other customers. On our first visit after my bad review, he offered to let me taste one of the wine by the glass offerings that he had suggested to go with some food I had ordered.  When I wrinkled my nose at it, he whisked the glass away and said well, what else would you like? On our last visit he forgot my husband's request for a second drink because he was busy chatting with his friends. Then he double charged us for one of our food items. 

After our last three visits (yes we gave it three tries with this bartender) it has slipped off our radar for good. 

Better sophisticated bar choices for mature folks in Harvard Square are Sandrine's, Rialto, Casablaca (a little noisy). Actually the bar at Legal Seafood is not bad either. I even prefer the bar at Cambridge One for a pizza or salad snack to the indifferent service at the Harvest. In Central Square, Central Kitchen, Rendevous, and Craigie on Main are excellent sophisticated bar choices...way better than the Harvest. 

By the way, this wouldn't put me off from eating a seated meal at the Harvest, especially in summer when the terrace is open.  And the food is, indeed quite good. But thumbs down on the bar...until they replace the staff.
