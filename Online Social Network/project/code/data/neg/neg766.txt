I must start out by telling you all that I am *not* a sanitation snob.

However, I went based on the reviews (and the price) to Sally's Nails to see if the Brazilians were as amazing as folks said they were.

I called to let them know I was running about 30 minutes late for my appnt., which they appreciated. I was seen immediately. 

The room where they do the waxing is small (claustrophobics be warned) and hasn't been redecorated since 1979, which is probably the age of the waxing chaise. That waxing lounger freaked me out. It was covered with paper, but I imagined all the years of UW students laying on it, the potential bedbugs, and it made me feel itchy. 
 
Lin, the owner who waxed me, didn't seem to have a problem with standing in the tiny room with me while I dropped trou, which was a bit awkward. I *hope* when she left the room for a moment, it was to wash her hands, but I don't know.  My whole waxing was done without disposable gloves. Icky! These are my *nether regions* we're talking about. Did I mention she used the same strip for my crack as well as my other bits?

That all being said, it *was* cheap and fast, and I haven't noticed any real difference between the results of getting waxed there and paying a TON more at The Sweet Spot. 

Honestly? I'll probably go back. Maybe I'll bring some disposable gloves from work and suggest they get used.
