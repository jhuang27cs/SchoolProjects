Octane. Probably one of Atlanta's best known coffee places. On paper, it has it all. Artisan coffee, beer and cocktail selection, music, and a generally welcoming atmosphere. Everyone seems to have a positive view of Octane. They consider it a great place to grab a cup of Joe, get some work done, or have an after-work cocktail. 

And for the life of me, I can't figure out why...
