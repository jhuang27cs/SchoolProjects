We ended up here because Border Cafe was having a tough time seating our party of 10 and Fire and Ice could accommodate us sooner.

I'd never been here before because chains, buffets and kitschy gimmicks don't really do it for me. (I have however been in this building when it was a Cyber Cafe!)

Fire and Ice somehow managed to enhance the low expectations I had for it.  It is dingy and cafeteria like.  The clientele seemed very suburban and young (not wise to the ways of good food or class), and the food was bland and just boring.  There is no question in my mind that my husband and I make better meals every night at home.  The alcoholic beverages were week and watery.  And as my husband mentioned freaking Cool Whip instead of whipped cream?!

To add insult to injury our server was inept and generally nonexistent.  He would take orders from half the table and walk away.  He brought rice/tortillas to half the table and left the other half starchless. He came over more times to apologize for his shitty service (after a friend complained) than he did to actually take our drink orders or bring us water.

This place is a joke.  Negative a million stars,

Also, as noted in a previous review the bathrooms were atrocious!  Two (out of three) clogged poopy toilets.  NASTY!
