In their defense, the Varsity has an interesting building with that sort of 50's diner feel, although I wouldn't call it quaint or anything since it is so huge. The only reason I went there is cause I saw it on TV on "diner's driveins and dives, and thought it looked interesting. That is the only reason I went. Unfortunatley, I didn't read any of the yelp reviews before I went. 

This was absolutely the worst fast food I have ever had. Ever. No, I really do mean ever. The fries came in a lump of soggy grease and were so limp that I could not even pick them up to get ketchup on them to hide how disgusting they tasted. The burger was so dry that I had to take a sip of my drink with each bite just to keep from choking. I threw most of the food away. The ONLY good thing I had was lemon ice cream, which was pretty fucking over-priced (4 dollars for 2 tiny scoops) the only reason I got the ice cream was to get the taste of the burger out of my mouth. I can't believe this place has been in business for this long, apparently there aren't that many fast food places in downtown Atlanta (otherwise this place would have gone out of business decades ago) or else maybe this is the type of food that people in the south like, I don't know, and I don't care, I just know that I will never be back again.

To sum it up I'll say go if you want to "say you've been there" but for the food, skip it and go to McDonald's
