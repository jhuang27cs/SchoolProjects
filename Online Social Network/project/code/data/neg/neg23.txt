Easter dinner and we decided to have Rock Bottom. Why you ask? Well somehow we were both super tired and I wanted to cook some dinner but the boy just wanted to be lazy and go out. 

It was between Flame Broiler or Rock Bottom. We should have gone to Flame Broiler! doh!!

We were seated in the a corner table while everyone else was seated in a booth. My bf whispered to me "racial discrimination?" haha. Who knows but it's not a big deal if we don't get to sit in a booth

I ordered the chicken panini sandwich. The chicken was grilled a little too long and was very dry. It came on thick bread that was lacking in pesto sauce. The mozzarella cheese was ok and there was only one slice of tomato. The argula was pretty standard. 

They are currently have a special of prime rib Fri-Sunday for $12.50 with mashed potatoes. OH DEAR! We should have known that ordering prime rib from a place that specializes in beer is a huge no go!!!

Prime rib: dry and pretty flavorless. The mashed potatoes..get this we never ever add salt to any of our restaurant food but we had to with these potatoes. They tasted from a box and apparently never made it to the seasoning station haha. 

Service: eh..our waitress seemed more attentive to the other customers than us. 

Total price: $30.00 with tax and tip. Eh.. I should have used that money for something else like clothes or shoes 

Probably only come back for the beer and not the food
