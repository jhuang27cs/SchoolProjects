i had high hopes for dan's. my last two burger encounters in the hood were amazing. but dan's fell short in a few ways.

i ordered some ridiculous burger with egg, bacon, cheese and pastrami. sounds good right? trust me it does sound good. that and a large horchata. 

the horchata is HUGE! i like that. it has ice, i don't like that. burger comes and right off the bat i notice a major problem. they cooked the egg all the way through. meaning no runny yoke to drip over my burger. very sad. next fault, the pastrami. it's thickly cut, chewy and dry. buried beneath these faults was yet another fault. the burger was lost under the toppings and had no flavor that could cut through the mess on top. i didn't even notice cheese in my burger. bacon was good, but i've still yet to come to a place that effs up bacon. 

i left full but not happy. be warned - some burger joints ARE as bad as they look.
