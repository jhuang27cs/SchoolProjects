I decided to have a birthday dinner here. I like swing dancing. And isn't "the Hip Kitty" just the cutest little name? I thought so. Well trying to get a reservation here was really hard. I had too many people so I couldn't sit inside to enjoy the music, which was half of the reason that I wanted to go there in the first place. 

We finally got seated and ordered drinks. The service was pretty slow. The cost of everything was expensive, and I never got full. I am not in any hurry to go back here.
