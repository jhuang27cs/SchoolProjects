My 12 year old loves the tshirts from Urban outfitters. We always order online but this time we decided to go into the store. The staff seem to think that they are way to cool to actually help anyone. Boy George walked right past me and did not even glance in our direction. You are not that hip Boy George..we dressed like that in the 80s. We found our selection alone and headed to the counter to pay. It was a quick and easy checkout and the girl was polite but I was not impressed when we got home to find stickers with weed pictures and the word "F()Ck" written on them. Really to a 12 year old. Their facebook page thinks the weed stickers are the coolest thing ever. It just turned me off the whole company. Give them to over 18 but really not to minors.
