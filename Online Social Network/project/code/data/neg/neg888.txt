Don't go here! Grace is too focused on gossiping AND talking non-stop about her personal BAGGAGE that she does TERRIBLE work! PLUS, watch out, she WILL overcharge you; especially when it comes to Botox units needed.
How dare she refuse to inject the amount of units YOU KNOW have worked for you for years? 
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE -- SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!
The girls at the front desk are sweet; my advice to them: Go find someone RESPECTABLE to work for!
