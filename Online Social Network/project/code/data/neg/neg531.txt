Ok, they delivered really quickly at 1:30am on a Friday night - so they get at least 2 stars for that.  And the thin crust pizza is okay.  But the deep-dish pan pizza?   Disgusting.  Somehow, it was inappropriately dough-y, soft, yet the cardboard was soaked through with oil.  So unpalatable that no one could finish their slice.  Really really bad.  Not this store's fault, but for the love of all that is holy, do not order the deep dish pan pizza (Pizza Hut is better.  Uno's is much better.  Pinnochio's is galaxy-times better.) - I want SOMEONE to benefit from my immense palate-suffering.
