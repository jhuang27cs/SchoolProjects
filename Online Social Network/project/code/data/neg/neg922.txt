Friendly Spot in Harvard square but honestly...everything was just soso. 

The mexican and cajun food was disappointing, not all that authentic-just really salty. I was really excited to try it too. My blackened catfish wasn't even spicy nor was the jambalaya or gumbo! Granted the one good thing was that the catfish was fresh and the chips provided were good...but everything else we had including the Fajitas, Gumbo, Blackened Chicken was subpar. Service was soso.

It seems like a big after work spot, but I personally wouldn't come back. Ive had much better food that doesn't leave me thirsty for the next 4 hours with higher cholesterol for non-authentic flavors.
