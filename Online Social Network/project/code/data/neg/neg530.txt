I must have been a french fry in my past life as i perished in oil.

i got the la cheese steak medium rare it came out just like in the pics about the length and a little bit fatter than a 6 inch subway sandwich cut in two. the content was weak. approx 10 leaves of gourmet lettuce and tomatoes the size of a 50 cent coin.

this sandwich was like a stickman compared to those at whole foods which are like fat bastard.

tasted pretty decent but was lacking depth, substance - a soul. definitely not worth the 10 dollar charge, thats like 45 chicken mcnuggets at mcdonalds. i think 10 nuggets would fill me up however.

i got the blue cheese fries which i think were so heavy and overwhelming with salt and fat i didn't know what to do but eat it. thanks a lot tongue.

because my tongue told my brain which told my hand to continue putting dressing soaked fries into my mouth, i had to be redeemed and jog it off because i felt as though i just ate at in n out. but the fries were somewhat albino. i like em like that, it feels and looks healthier. so good job with that! actually, it reminds me of my oven fries which are unmatched in flavor and nutritional content. thats y.

the nice thing is that if you are a "student" you get 10% off. the place was getting about half full at lunch on thursday. i think i prefer whole foods for a sandwich at that price however and would definitely rather eat in n out if i were to have those grossness consequences
