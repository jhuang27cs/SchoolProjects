There might be great things to say about Andreas for Greek dinner, but don't expect much of a Mediterranean styled weekend brunch.  I found very little imagination here for any kind of brunch menu.  My longtime dining companion and I found our egg en trees to be uninspired and the staff unenthusiastic.  Maybe Sisyphus brunches at Andreas.  Zeus demands better.
