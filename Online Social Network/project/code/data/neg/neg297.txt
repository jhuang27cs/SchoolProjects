I went to Beautique after reading wonderful reviews about the waxing there so made an appt for eyebrows and while I was there I thought I'd get my hair done as well, my first one since moving to Houston.
I had eyebrows with Jennifer and she took literally less than a minute. My brows weren't a huge mess to begin with but she did a fine, quick job. I needed blonde highlights and a cut (my hair was long and I wanted to cut it all off) and had an appt with Lindsey. Color is OK, she just used one shade of blonde. As for the cut when I got home I realized it was not very well done and am thinking of going to any cheap place asap like supercuts or something just to get the cut fixed. I wanted a subtle asymmetric bob, no layers - just straight across (not too drastic like poshe spice) and the more I look at it, the more I see how uneven the ends are; there are some inner pieces which are longer than the outer ones. The cut itself was 70 and the color was 100, Im not sure it was worth it. I will say that they are good about scheduling and trying to fit you in so you don't miss you next appointments. Might go back for waxing, not for hair.
