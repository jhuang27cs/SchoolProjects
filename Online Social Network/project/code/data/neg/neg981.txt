Maybe its just me, but I don't like the greasy slim sliders they serve at Blimpy Burger - if it was called Super Sliders I might be ok with it.  

A real burger to me is a good hefty thick patty of beef that oozes with meat juice and pushes away any remaining heart-attack guilt you might have in your head with beefy goodness.  This, unfortunately, is not served at said Blimpy Burger. 

Instead, think White Castle - slim burgers with just a lil' meat but all the grease, and lots of fried accompaniments.  It's certainly a splurge, but not one worth its salt, IMHO.
