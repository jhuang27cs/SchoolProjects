This review is NOT based on this particular store but rather for the company itself, AT&T.

Some years ago I had both my internet service and my cell phone through AT&T. In both cases, the provided services were at an 'acceptable' level. Nothing special but equating to other companies. My eventual overall dissatisfaction arose from multiple cases of what started off as relatively minor problems.

In each case, what I thought of as relatively minor problems, grew into unresolvable beasts, when I had a need to contact CUSTOMER SERVICE (and I use that term very loosely). I don't know that they still do so, but I learned to cringe when they answered the phone with, "How may I provide you with excellent service?". It got to the point that my standard opening response was, "I'll accept decent service". 

Without going further into details, I haven't had business with them for over 3 years now, that said... they have come back, uninvited, into my life.

My credit monitoring service recently contacted me with a notice of unusual activity. Investigating, I discovered that a collection company out of Florida had placed an unpaid bill of $33 on my credit report. There were no details but digging deeper, I went to http://annualcreditreport.com/ and found that it was associated with an AT&T claim.

As much as I dislike AT&T, I ALWAYS pay my bills (assuming I'm aware of them). I'm still investigating, but, this is just another check box confirming to NEVER again consider purchasing ANY service from AT&T.

Their sales people will say all the right things. Their brochures are shiny and refined. Their commercials are alluring. Their actual services and products are.... okay... but when something goes awry, and sooner or later something will... their customer service is substandard, significantly so, and is the basis for AVOIDING this company at all cost. Don't take my word for it, check out ConsumerReports regular reviews.
