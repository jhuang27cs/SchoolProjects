I've seen pets with better people skills than one of their bartenders. We only had to deal with her once, then we grabbed a table. This proved to be just as disastrous. 

To rate the service, I had to come up with a different word for it, because calling it 'service' is being too kind. I'm going with negligence. And the negligence we received was top notch! If you've never waited a table in your life, please apply here. No doubt you will be employee of the month upon walking in the door. 

The food was passable, but I have one gripe. If you're gonna ask us how we want our burgers cooked, then bring out four identical patties, maybe just don't ask how to cook them in the first place. I have no problem with a greasy med-well / well done burger, but when you ask and I'm expecting medium rare and I get well done, you have problems.
