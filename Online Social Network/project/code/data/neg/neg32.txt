Granted I've only eaten at the Natural Cafe twice, but both times I was unimpressed.  In theory, it sounds great - and delicious.  Maybe I've just ordered the wrong things.  I got a baked potato that reminded me of something that you forget is in the oven and then a couple days later discover its mummified corpse.  It was so hard and dry that I asked for another - which turned out exactly the same.  I guess the disconnect between the image in my mind when I think of this cafe and the actual food is the level of freshness.  We all know that healthy doesn't have to equal stale and boring.  Again, maybe I've just had bad luck, but this isn't a place I'm anxious to revisit.
