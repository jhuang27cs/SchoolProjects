I went to see Dr. Soohoo several months ago after much research and he is the only one at UCLA listed as Foot and Ankle surgeon and consider a "Super Doctor"  Well, let me tell you, after waiting for over an hour, I found him to be arrogant and did not even give me a correct diagnosis.  I don't know who he paid to write good things about him but he does not deserve this title.  My visit was just short of adversarial. 
What a lousy doctor.  He should learn some bedside manners.  No trust here!
