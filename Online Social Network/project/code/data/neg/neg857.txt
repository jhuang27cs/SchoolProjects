First off, I can't believe anyone has ever had a positive waxing experience here! And some of the other reviews (eg, Marji S) seem rather fake in that they are extremely vague and apparently the only review this person has ever written. Hmmm, suspicious!

That said, if you ENJOY a very painful wax that leaves your legs looking like you shaved with butter knife (yes, STILL HAIRY and nice and RED!), and gives you an uncountable number of ingrown hairs a week later, this IS the place for you. 

Need I elaborate? Okay, I will. So, Maryam seems like a nice lady. She even returned (part) of my money when I went back the next day -- though she did claim that my leg hair was "too short" which must have been the problem. (This could not possibly have been the problem, since the reason the hair was that short was because her waxing job broke it off, instead of removing it! I think she knew this and suspect by the hushed tone of her voice that there was someone in the waxing room at that moment, poor soul.)   

But seriously, if you're going to dye your own hair *when you have two appointments scheduled for that time block already* and answer your cell phone during an appointment *when it is a wrong number so couldn't have been an emergency* you had better be damn good. Bedside manner doesn't worry me, unless it is paired with a total hack job. Which this was. 

Lest you think this is a one-time problem, or that I somehow have hair of supernatural strengths that is un-waxable,  I should note that I went with a friend, who had the exact same experience. 

So for waxing, I would not step near this place. Every time I walk by, my legs involuntarily cross. Maryam haunts my dreams!
