Best part is the outdoor patio, and they are dog-friendly.

We had a rough start ...at least 10 minutes before we were served water, another 10+ minutes before we had a server approach us.  We requested bread, and it was another 10+ minutes before we got bread.  A table that arrived after us got prompt service, water and bread, while we sat there feeling like we were invisible.

Our server finally comes out and says they have a new computer and she's not sure she put in our order.  We ask if she can just please get us our salads, as we were starving.  She brings the salads and says our order should be out soon.  Nice light dressing on a bed of greens with a tiny slice of tomato.  Tasty, but very boring.

I had ordered the Salmon sandwich, hold the bread.  The salmon could not have been more than 3 ounces, was very thin, and way over-cooked.  I guess they knew there is no way they could just serve that on a plate, so they put more salad on the plate.

Hubby ordered the BLAT ... bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato sandwich ... how can you mess that up.  Nothing to write home about.

Nice place, nice atmosphere, and we enjoyed dining out on the patio with our dog.  However, very over-priced for very hum-drum food, and less than responsive customer service.  We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and left hungry.  I doubt we will return ...  maybe dinner is more successful there.
