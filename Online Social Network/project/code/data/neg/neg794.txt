bad, bad, bad, bad, bad... i reeeeeeally don't usually do this, but literally everything was sub par about this place.  the gatekeeper dude who seats people has to be the most agressive, surly host i've ever encountered at a restaurant.  after about an hour wait on a saturday morning, our party was seated at a (very intimate) shared table with another party who happened to be quite nice... but the shared table situation wasn't exactly what any of us had in mind, nor had it been intimated to us we'd be sitting with someone else.

no bearing on the rating, but louis also has some of the lamest, worst art i've ever seen in a restaurant in providence.

the real kick in the pants came from the food, though.  how can a place that's so busy serve nothing but food that tastes like it's been sitting below an underpowered heat lamp for the past week?  i think someone else on here mentioned the unmelted cheese on the huevos rancheros, but it bears mentioning again.  i could barely get the damn things down.  

are brown students afraid to leave college hill to get some real breakfast?  maybe that's how this place stays afloat.
