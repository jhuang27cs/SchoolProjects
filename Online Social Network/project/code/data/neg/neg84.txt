So, they didn't want to tell me the prices over the phone (or by email) because they said their pricing structure is too complicated.  

(They do offer discounts for UW students/staff and local businesses - although those don't apply to me - so I don't know what those would be)

However the basic price breakdowns ARE NOT complicated.

$49/month (month to month/no committment) plus $100 enrollment fee
$39/month (billed monthly/ 1 year committment) plus $100 fee
$29/month (one year paid upfront /no enrollment fee)
$19/month (two year paid upfront / no enrollment fee)

Now I gotta crunch some numbers and see which plan makes sense for me.
