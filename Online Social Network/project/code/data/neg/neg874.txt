This place and food stinks with a passion.  I feel bad that the waitresses have to serve the plates that come out of the kitchen.  I did not mind the look of the place itself but why go eat at a place when the food is not edible and ridiculously high prices for what you are getting. I will never come back here for Korean or Japanese food.  You would think that because the restaurant is located in the middle of Harvard Square; it would be decent but definitely not.  The food is well below par standards.  It gives Korean and sushi a bad name.  We ordered Beef Bulgoki, Chicken Bulgoki, Bibim Naeng-Myon, Salmon Maki, and Boston Maki. ...and I want a refund.
