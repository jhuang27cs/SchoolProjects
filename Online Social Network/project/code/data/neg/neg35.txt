My fiance visited this shop for an oil change on his 05 Tundra with a discount coupon. Although we had an appointment, we had to wait there for almost 2 hours. Anyway, it turned out that they did more than what they were supposed to do (ex. brake/engine oil, battery chemical clean up). My fiance was OK with that, since they needed to be done soon or later. It wasn't any problem until we got the truck back. It stalled 3 times in the middle of W Holcombe (before the Kirby intersection). It was an EXTREMELY scary situation because this could have caused an accident as other cars will run into his truck. Luckily speaking, he was able to pull over to a strip center immediately. We were able to drive back to the shop, and when we confronted the manager, he was like there should be NO PROBLEM!!! He let his mechanics (whoever worked on the truck) to look into it again. We waited for another 30 minutes, and according to the manager's explanation, he said that it was NO PROBLEM at all because they tested drive it again and it never stalled. Plus he believed that the computer in the truck was set in the re-training mode (WTF, they must have done something, hello, although my fiance and I were no mechanics, but we aren't stupid). Wasn't it their job in the first place to ensure that everything was fine before letting us picking the truck up??????? Without a doubt, all they care about was the MONEY, and they didn't give a crap about our safety. FYI, this was our first visit, and it will be our last as well. Note that if you care about your safety and the quality of maintenance on your vehicle. Please don't ever dare thinking about visiting My Mechanic!!!!! I honestly wish that I could give it a "No" star rating. There are plenty of places where you can get excellent customer service.
