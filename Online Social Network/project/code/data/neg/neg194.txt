Went there with high expectations based on some of the reviews I've read, but sadly it was disappointing.  From the outside, it looks quite charming, but once you get inside you have the choice between an overly bright large dining room or the smaller bar area to the right.  We chose to dine in the smaller area over the main dining room which was fine except I felt the decor could use some updating.  

Service was very good and the staff were friendly, but the food was just average.  My partner said he could taste that his fish had been frozen and for the expense of the meal, I thought that was pretty unacceptable.  We also had quite different dishes, but received the exact same side dishes which didn't complement either meal well.  Overall, we left pretty dissatisfied.  To charge the prices they are charging, they need to drastically improve the quality.
