This place is over-hyped.  I thought I'd stop in since I've heard that this place is an "institution" around the ATL.  I left thinking most of the waitresses should be in an institution to learn how to smile and be friendly.  Most of them just stared at me when I came in.  The decor needs updating and included some of those corny message signs (e.g., "Women don't fart, women don't belch, and women don't snore so they BITCH or they would blow up").

Food was nothing special.  My country ham was soaked in a dark "sauce" that was too salty.  The sauce could have been soy sauce.  I've had better at Waffle House.

That was probably my first and last visit to the Silver Skillet.
