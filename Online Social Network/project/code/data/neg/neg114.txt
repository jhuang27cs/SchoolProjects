Food:
I would love to love this place but really there is better southern food around, biscuits are pathetic, country ham not good at all. I just don't get it.....I went here 15 years ago and wasn't impressed...saw that Rachel Ray went here on her show so we decided to try again.....still not worth it.

Service:
Fine

Atmosphere: 
Great little space and patio...just a shame the food is not worth coming back to!
