An Irish-themed pub -- but in that over the top fake sort of way.  

The food isn't bad but it's not very good -- it's your standard pub fare not very well executed.  I assume the beer selection is good, but as a wine/cocktail drinker, there's not a very good selection.  Definitely don't order the sangria (I don't know what I was thinking) :)

The atmosphere is of the chain bar type -- lacking any charm or personality where it feels almost like a late night version of Chili's.
