Thieves, Liars, I would rather eat dog shit than to ever rent from this property management company! They don't even deserve one star. I was placed in an apartment that was infested with Roaches, had crackhead neighbors upstairs that never slept (therefore I didn't get much sleep), was attacked by said crackheads, my window busted out by neighbor children, had a constant ceiling leak from the neighbors above me with black mold. Never once did they address any of the issues with this place, basically told me everything was my problem and they weren't responsible. Then sent me a letter after my move out date saying I owed them $500 for an air filter, a small stain on the carpet, and screens that were never on my windows to begin with? They will NEVER see that money.
