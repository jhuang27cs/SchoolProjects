I went to Carlow as a freshmen left and now I am back as a Junior.  

I live off Campus  and take CAP classes which are accelerated classes for adult students.  

Con- Carlow forces you to purchase health insurance and the cost of the plan is $5600.00 other wise you have to buy your own health insurance and provide proof that you are insured. 
I feel like I being fed a load of bullsnit.  I don't think that having health insurance should be mandated by the university that you attend.  I feel as if this is a choice that each student should made for herself. 

Because of this policy a $5600.00 health insurance policy gets added into your tuition costs.  Driving up the dollars  of loan money you need. That could other wise be going towards your actual education.  The kicker!!! Wait for it.  You then now have to pay interest on health insurance. 

I am giving Carlow 1 star for cashing in on the FOR PROFIT HEALTH INSURANCE BUSINESS I wonder what kind of kick backs they're getting from Blue cross Blue shield.  Because not every university subscribes to this policy I can say that it's not a Federal nor State Mandate, but a choice that Carlow has made for all of its students. 

Why not keep the students best interest in mind, instead of getting into bed with Big Health Insurance.
