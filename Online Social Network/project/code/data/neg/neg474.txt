I won't be going back. The sushi was bad, the service was bad, and the prices were way too high for what we got: poorly rolled sushi arranged haphazardly on dinner plates.  I realize you get what you pay for, and in this instance, the prices should have been lower. Even if I were a student, I wouldn't come here - for the money, you can get decent sushi elsewhere.
