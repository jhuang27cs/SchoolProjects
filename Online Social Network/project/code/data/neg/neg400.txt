Car was in horrendous shape. Tank wasnt full when I got it...it's much easier to fill up a tank  than to leave just a quarter in it! God forbid you need roadside assistance...TOOK HOURS on HOLD (what does that tell you about the quality of their fleet)! That was before I got to speak to someone...it only got worse, much much worse. Consider yourself warned.
