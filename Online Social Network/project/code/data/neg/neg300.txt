It's decent but overpriced.  The menu's uninspired, typical sandwiches, salads and wraps (not remotely a diner).  Wait service was slow every time I was there.  Burgers weren't flavorful and not enough bleu cheese on mine.  Pierogies seemed to be the supermarket variety.  Brie and raspberry sauce was too simple, fresh raspberries would have been better.  Noble attempt but really just an average sandwich place.
