The only redeeming factor about this hotel was the staff, who was super nice. Like others who've posted, my bed sheets were stained, mattress was stained,  pillow case was stained, comforter was stained, carpet was stained...that's a lot of stains! Whole place was run down. The bathroom had no light inside so you only had the hallway light to illuminate  The hallways did smell of curry. Someone said hotel Durant (which was half a block up) was much better for a similar rate.
