I remember a time when the line for this place was out the door.  I'd show up early so I could get a table before the rush and have a great time.  I had great service, some great food, and some fun conversations.

Then I went back.

Originally, I was really excited because there was no line.  That should have told me something, right there.  Sadly, I was blinded and deafened by hunger.  We were seated promptly, and then forgotten about.  The sauce bar was empty.  BONE FUCKIN DRY.  The meats weren't as diverse as they once were, and the quality of ingredients had gone downhill.  On top of that, the grill staff seemed less. . . with it.

We actually left to get better food with better service from Sto Two-Fo. . if that tells you anything.  

All in all the food was bad, the service was lousy, and I had ZERO fun.

Sorry Fire and Ice, but. . .you suck.
