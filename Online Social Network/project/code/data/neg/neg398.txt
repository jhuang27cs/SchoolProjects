I loved the Greca pizza here, and used to order it for lunch delivery at least once a week for several weeks from the West U location. One day, I called up and the person answering insisted that they have NEVER delivered to my location, and that it was "impossible" that I'd ordered all those pizzas. Pretty sure I didn't imagine all the money I had given them regularly, and all the tasty pizzas I'd enjoyed, especially since I was looking at a delivery receipt from them while I was on the phone with this guy. Apparently, though, I hallucinated all of it. I would have considered going there for dine-in or takeout, but the attitude of that guy still sticks in my craw. How hard is it to instead say "I'm sorry, we weren't supposed to deliver to that location" (if that was the issue) rather than being a jerk about it?
