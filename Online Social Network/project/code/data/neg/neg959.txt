I went there for the Digital TV Converter box.  They have only TWO to choose from, but it's already better than Sears/Kmart.   
They both priced at $59.99, with tax would be $64.94.  Now, I have a $25 gift card and the $40 coupon, which could cover it and have 6 cents change.

First off, the cashier area has a weird set up, the line is way too far from the cashier and no one really know there's a line.  Someone cut before me because of that, of course! BLAH!.

Then, somehow the $40 coupon is counted as Credit card (as the girl explained to me) so she asked me if I know how much I have on the gift card, because she had to take from the gift card first, then credit card (the coupon).  Since you cannot do anything else with the $40 coupon, you would think they will take $24.94 from the gift card and everything else on the coupon/credit card.  Nope. Instead of giving me 6 cents balance on my gift card, she took my $25 gift card and left me with a coupon with 6 cents balance on it.  Um... so what am I suppose to do with it? Buy another box with it?!   Not that the 6 cents is a big deal but I just think people would be smarter.  Oh well.
