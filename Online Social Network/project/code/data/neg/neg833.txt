I nearly gave 3 stars for the service, which was absolutely impeccable. Couldn't have been more attentive. A couple of the dishes on the salad/veggie/appetizer bar were really good. The Mint Mango peppercorn salad dressing was delicious. The roast pineapple was fantastic. The green for "feed me" red for "have mercy" thing was fun. But the rest? Disappointing.

The meat was good quality and juicy, but the flavors just weren't working for me - maybe too blackened/smokey? Some were burnt outside under-cooked inside.The one dip for the meats we got was spicy chipotle. It was crazy intense - not too spicy - but it hijacked your mouth so you couldn't really taste what you were eating with it.

Generally, I found the food inconsistent - either way intense flavor or unexpectedly bland.

The Cloudline Pinot Gris was unpleasant.  I forget the year but a surprise to find such a badly balanced wine on their list. 

I thought dessert would save the day. The chocolate torte had a good texture but wasn't very chocolaty. The caramel gelato tasted of cheap artificial caramel sauce, the brazil nut thing didn't need the bacon - it wasn't bad - it was just a hint of weird.

Overall not worth the large amount of cash you have to part with.
