The good: MALTS. With grainy, real, NOT soft-serve ice cream. YUM.

The bad: The burgers. Now, I like greasy burgers, but this was a new level of oiliness. I was not up for the challenge and didn't even finish mine. We speculated that maybe they had a butter curtain the burgers passed through, like the glaze curtain at krispy kreme?

and the ugly: Guadalupe. Noisy. You can sit outside but it's in this fenced-in little triangle that makes you feel rather zoo-animalish. 

I will return for the malt. To go.
