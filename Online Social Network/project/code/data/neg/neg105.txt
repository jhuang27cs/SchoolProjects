I ate here about 2 months ago with my in-laws who are huge fans of cafe noir. Unfortunately I wasn't that impressed with the food.
My steak was not the best cut, chewy and stringy.
Portions seemed small for the price you pay. (we shared a "mini" serving of a pot de creme that I don't think was meant to be mini.)
Prices seemed inflated for the quality of the food. If you're going to pay that much for dinner, spend a few dollars more and go to Nicks.

The high point was our waiter, who was charming. He made us feel welcome and offered some comfort for the less than fabulous food.
