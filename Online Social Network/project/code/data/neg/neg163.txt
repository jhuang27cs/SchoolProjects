This place has a reputation, which is what lured me in, but I doubt I'll go back.  It was the kind of burger joint that relies heavily on piling ingredients on top of your burger for flavor, and doesn't give much attention to the meat itself.  Disappointing.  Service seemed deliberately snarky when I was there, but others seem to have had a good experience.
