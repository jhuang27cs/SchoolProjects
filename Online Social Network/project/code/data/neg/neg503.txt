On my maiden visit to Diddy Riese on Christmas Eve,  the entire line hated my guts because I ordered ahead for pick up and skipped the line.  A visibly miffed effeminate man rather forcefully poked my ribs and said "what's going on here, did you order ahead or something?".  After answering a bewildered "yeah" to the pissed off crowd behind me, a twerpy, spoiled Beverly Hills girl said (Paris Hilton style) "I am NOT down with that at all."  And a very Merry Christmas to you too! By the way, it's the terrible customer service that causes this long line, not the volume of people. 

Aaaaaanyway... I just had to sample these supposedly mind expanding treats in my car.  I took a bite...   chewed it, swallowed.... thought for a second...  Yeah...  I'm pretty sure I've had these before. They're called COOKIES. And very average cookies at that (cookies are supposed to be good).  Same goes for the brownies.  As my gal pal from the line would say, WHAT-EV-ER.  Definitely inexpensive - I'll give 'em that.

JUSTIFICATION UPDATE:  Everyone at the party had the same reaction to these cookies. They're good but nothing anyone should go out of their way for.  In fact, the cookies I bought from Whole Foods actually went over better.
