If I could give this company a "0" star, I would!

When I first called to find their location, the woman on the phone stated that they were rated by AAA.  As a member I asked if this were true -- AAA told me that they do not endorse any taxi companies.

When I was in East Palo Alto at my Extra Storage Storage Space letting the movers into my unit for them to load.  The estimate of time for the movers to pack and be at my new home was 1.5 hours.

I called at 8:00AM for a cab.

I had 7 Smart phone messages:

1) 8:AM -- taxi #1736 was dispatched at 8AM.
2)8:06AM -- taxi #5 was dispatched at 8:04
3) 8::08AM  -- taxi #1714 was dispatched at 8:07AM
4) 8:11 -- taxi # 655 -- taxi #655 was dispatched at 8:10AM
5) 8:14AM -- taxi #1739 -- was dispatched at 8:31AM
6) 8:16 -- taxi #1832 was dispatched at  8:14AM
7) taxi # 1710 -- was dispatched at 8:20AM

In addition I received 3 calls from the taxi drivers ... 3 different men with 3 different dialects:

A) The first one said that he would be there in 20 minutes.

B) The second one said that he would be there is 15 minutes.

C) The third one said that he would be there is 10 minutes.  I asked if he was coming because I had already had 2 other calls from 2 other drivers.

When the 3rd taxi driver arrived he called me on my cell, even though I was in the sun about 15 feet from the entrance.

One of his quotes was:" I thought that you were black -- I know black people with your name.  And, of course you being in East Palo Alto."  I was fuming -- he wasn't white ... was the taxi company jerking me around because they thought that I wasn't white -- RACIST.

Then he got a call on his cell phone from another cab driver asking about traffic on Middlefield Road in Palo Alto-- though he said yes, he didn't end the conversation.  He missed the turn.  When he ended the call, he asked ME why I didn't let him know that HE had missed the turn.

And, yes you guessed it, the movers arrived to my new home, prior to me arriving there!

I would NEVER recommend this cab company to anyone.
