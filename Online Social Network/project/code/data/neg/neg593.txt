Came here again the other day. Service was just as slow. Friend ordered the yellow curry I believe, and I had the Thai noodle soup. He liked his curry. My noodle soup on the other hand had WAYYYY too much flavor. It was like you're slurping on a mouth full of spices. YUCK. I had my friend try it also, and he didn't like it either.

Um yeah, next time I think I'm going to stick to Thai foods that I know and have eaten before. XD
