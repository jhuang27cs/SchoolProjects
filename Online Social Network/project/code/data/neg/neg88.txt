Let's have a sit-down sushi restaurant in the size of a dorm room!!! really, it's that small and I would never want to eat there unless maybe it were summer, christmas, thanksgiving... any time when school isn't in session. 

The food isn't bad for cheap, fast sushi... i suppose. I really like the spicy tuna roll which I get to-go (and I usually have to wait like 10 minutes for it, but at least I get to see them make it to order) and they have some hot tea for you to sip on while you wait. I've tried a few other things on the menu but, I really wouldn't recommend it unless you're just looking for an alternative to all the fried rices and egg rolls and heavy pastas and slabs of meat that you normally find at asian ghetto. 

The 'finding nemo' roll picture on the outside (don't know if it's still there), is it... an advertisement? to be funny? it's like a cartoon picture of nemo, cut up in a roll, and SMILING?!?!  highly, HIGHLY disturbing.
