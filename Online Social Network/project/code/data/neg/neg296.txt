Haircut was decent, but pricey for what is was at a student rate of $20.  Had to endure 30 minutes of Fox News and Kami talking about why Obama sucks.  I came for a haircut, not unsolicited regurgitated political talking points.  There's a salon or barbershop every 30 feet in this neighborhood, so I probably won't be back.  Got the back of my shirt soaked washing my hair after the cut.  Seems like a good guy who's very much into the community, but 30 mins of politics that I didn't want to hear or talk about and a few uncomfortable comments about Muslims (him not knowing I am one, obviously) sunk it for me.
