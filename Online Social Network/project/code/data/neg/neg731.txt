Be forewarned ladies (and gents): Advance Tires is a rip-off operation.  I'm a young small woman and I hate seeing mechanics for this reason.  I had a plugged tire that was slowly leaking, so I went into Advance Tires to get the tire replaced.

My car is a 94 Geo Prizm.  It's old and ugly, and I dont invest in fancy parts for it.  I guess the Advance Tire counter guy knew he wouldn't be able to talk me into an expensive tire (s), so he decided to fool me into believing that my rim was bad.  Showed me where it was rusty and gunked up and claimed the air leak was due to the build-up - said my tire wouldn't seal against it.

Now in my heart I knew this was BS but I figured WTF if it ensures success, why not.  I bought the line and a used $75 rim to boot.  When I get home and tell my bf, he's pissed that I didn't call him before buying, but whatever it's too late - 75 bucks down the drain.

Fast Fwd:  Four months later.  My brakes are grinding.  My bf takes the car to his auto mechanic cousin.  Find out that my brake caliper seized up because the BS used rim didn't even fit my car.   Now, I'm shelling out big dollars for brakes, rotors, and a new caliper thanks to Advance Tire and their used rim.

So... a $50 tire replacement ended up costing me about $400.  I'm not happy, but I guess it's my own fault for going against my better sense.  Do not be fooled by these jovial acting dudes.  They are swindlers.  If you are a woman, avoid this place like the plague.
