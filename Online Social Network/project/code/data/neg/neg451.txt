Thai Spice is Crave.  Crave is Thai Spice.  If you liked Crave, you'll like Thai Spice.  If you didn't, then save your time. 

My review is on the campus location only.  I ordered the Tom Yum soup and Unagi Don.  The Tom Yum soup tasted sour and otherwise bland.  I could taste the dried lemongrass from the first sip, AND there was no garnish.  I was looking forward to the Unagi Don since this was a new item, but the rice was served...cold.  
I was happy that they carried Ashai Black though.
