Very disappointed in this restaurant.  It had great potential and a wonderful looking large menu, but almost every dish had a problem.  Toro was tender, but didnt see any marbling and it had an odd color and tasted fishy.  The miso soup had no flavor, it was a step above water.  The house salad was fine and I am told the gyoza were good.  The complimentary fried chicken was fatty but not in a good way and had no flavor except for oil.  The tempura was okay, a moderately light coating, but could have been lighter and the vegetables were all over-cooked, like they had been pre-cooked.  The chicken in the Don dish was overcooked and dry and the sauce was barely present with no dipping sauce for the tempura so it was a very dry dish.  Another persons tempura dipping sauce that I did try had no flavor.  The staff were all nice and quickly reactive, but not very proactive.
