Blah. People talk about the pizza, but honestly, I don't think the pizza is very good. Maybe I'm a bit biased, as I love my New York thin crust pizza, but taste is taste and this pizza is basically a thick bland mound of bread. Food takes forever to come out, but I wouldn't mind waiting, if the pizza was that good.

It's not real deep dish either. Deep dish has the toppings and cheese stuffed on the inside. Kind of like a pie. It's far tastier that what's offered here.

The majority of the time the service is rude and unwelcoming. Overall, not very impressed.
