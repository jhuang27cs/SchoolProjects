To the Campus Community:

Because of possible exposure to the hepatitis A virus, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has advised that patrons who ate sandwiches at or from Jerry's Deli in Westwood (located at 10925 Weyburn Ave.) on November 18, 21, 23 or 24 receive an immune globulin (IG) shot or a hepatitis A vaccine no later than 14 days from the date they visited or otherwise ate food from the restaurant to prevent or reduce illness.

Affected residents are encouraged to seek treatment through their personal physicians. The Department of Public Health will also provide IG shots and hepatitis A vaccinations through several walk-in clinics through December 8, 2010.

For more information, contact Los Angeles County Public Health Communications during normal business hours at 213-240-8144, or after business hours and during the weekend at 213-990-7107.

Sincerely,
