Ok I was disappointed with this place!! The restrooms were awful to begin with!!! 
The appertizers were good but the main course was horrible!!! For being a restaurant that opened up in LA, I expected more from it!!! 

The bar upstairs was the only thing that seems to be going for this place - without it, I do not think this place stands for anything!! Definately better places out there.
