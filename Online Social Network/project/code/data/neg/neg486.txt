This store is really convenient and I've got to believe that's the only reason it's still around.  The selection is decent and the prices aren't awful - though you're definitely paying the "Thayer St. tax" - but the service is god awful.  I've had better customer service from automated checkouts.  The employees are in no way helpful or nice, they're always distracted by some group of friends or their phones, and they interact with you as little as possible while you're paying.  If it's 9:45pm and you need a bottle of wine then go, but other than that avoid it.  With so many liquor stores in the area - Bottles, Darwin's, Campus Fine Wines, or Bin 312, to name a few - why bother dealing with such apathy?
