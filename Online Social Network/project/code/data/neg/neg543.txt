My first experience at this restaurant was not so memorable. The waitress mentioned that there was a peppermint drink. So i ordered that. It came out that it was an awful taste of lemonade with peppermint leaves on top. The appetizer I ordered was seaweed salad. Half of the dish was wakame salad and the other half was cucumber mixed what I guessed was really diluted lemonade, which is again not so tasty. On top of that, I ordered today's chef special which was a seared fish sushi. It was supposed to be delicious because it is recommended but it turned out to taste worse than the regular California roll that my friend ordered. I didn't even finish the main sushi dish. I should not have wasted my money there. Bad tasted food brought me down. This restaurant ruined my afternoon.   

Another thing is the server was hard to call. And it took long before she appeared close to our table. I would never go there again! Never!
