Eh, I think this place is overrated. However, my roommate has insisted that I inform you that she thinks it's the shit (in more or less words, and maybe a little bit of rewording). However, at this point I still have not had one good experience here. My first time coming here was when I first moved to the U-District. The Mee Sum at Pike Place has the most AMAZING hum bow, so I was thinking they would be very similar (due to the confusion of having the same name). I purchased a chicken hum bow and bbq hum bow. Wow, I've never had a hum bow that was so bad I could not stand to eat it.....but I could only manage a few bites out of each before giving up and throwing them out. I tried coming back for the bubble tea since my roommate constantly raves about it along with most of her friends. I tried the red bean bubble tea, but it tasted a bit chalky which seemed to be due to using a powder and not mixing very well. Finally, the last time I was here was due to my roommate dragging me here (ok, maybe not literal dragging...but I always make her go to Oasis, so it was my turn to go to her favorite bubble tea place; though, I did not go happily!). I got the strawberry milk tea, which is my regular drink at Oasis and what I usually get to compare bubble tea places. Wow, this was the worst tasting bubble tea I've ever had in my life. It tasted like strawberry flavored medicine, to be exact it tastes like these nasty strawberry chewable zinc vitamins by Zicam. Since I had paid almost $4 for it (including the credit card fee), I tried to force myself to drink it....however, it was so bad I just wanted to throw up every time I took a sip. I can't remember what my roommate got, but it tasted like sprite and was really overkill on the sweetness. I would give them one star, but since my roommate loves this place and the cashiers are pretty nice I gave them 2 stars (though if I could give half stars I would give them a 1.5). Personally, I would recommend passing this place up.
