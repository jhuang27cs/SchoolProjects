Be careful when opening your accounts here. 

I had set up a joint checking account with an automatic savings transfer and the money was being accidentally sent to another random customer. 

When I got this fixed, I was getting monthly service fees on two accounts of which I was told I would not be getting any service fees as long as I had a transfer of money to my savings account each month. Wells Fargo said my money would be returned on the next business day. Nope.

After: 
- 1 week
- 3 follow up calls I made
- being told to come into the branch to get this fixed (uh, I've got exams!)
- ..and another call to a manager (who didn't seem very nice on the phone with her tone of voice) I'm hopefully getting my monthly service fees returned.

Not that I have much money being transferred around, but I'm in college, and getting hit with 'service fees' when I was told I wasn't going to have any 'service fees' adds up ($25 here, $5 here, $10 here - it adds up over the course of time. Plus, interest on savings are less if you add all the charges up for a year when service fees are taking money away from the savings.). 

Also, it doesn't help that money from my checking was originally being routed to some random customer. Dude, seriously - there should be some kind of system to ensure this doesn't happen! The bank has what I need (checkings, savings, joint account) but I wish they had better follow up/customer service after sending my money to a random account and then charging me fees and not following up on their error. 

Read your statements carefully!
