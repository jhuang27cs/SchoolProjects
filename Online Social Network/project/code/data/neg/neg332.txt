One would assume a waitress that electronically enters their order into a handheld device would be able to get that order to the kitchen accurately.  Parties of two: not that difficult. 

One would assume their waitress would be able to deliver a beer in less than 15 minutes, and that said beer would be what they ordered.

One would assume their waitress would not tell them their food "Might be ready, I just heard a bell," after waiting over an hour and asking if they could just leave instead of waiting any longer.  Please just let me leave.    

One would assume they wouldn't be given a bill for a dish they neither ate nor ordered.

One would assume a manager might come and make nice with a table that had a horrendous experience even if the manager was busy because they "Just got in."

Well, we all know what happens when one assumes... 

Their burgers are really tasty but they can't seem to get that tricky service thing down.  I loved sitting outside in the sun.  Hanging out and people watching are favorite pastimes.   I guess I'd go back if I didn't have my heart set on eating anything or getting the beer we ordered... that can't be good for business.  

Oh now, there I go making assumptions again.
