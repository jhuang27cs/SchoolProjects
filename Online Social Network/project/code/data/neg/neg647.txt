Oh, how excited my hungover ass was to see that Longhorn Delivery offered a Mexican option!  I had never eaten there before, but surely a crappy Mexican restaurant could not survive amongst the really good ones here, right?  Boy, was I wrong.  That had to be the worst mexican meal I have ever eaten, hands down.  Everything on my plate (and my friend's plate) tasted the same, like nothing.  No seasoning, no spice, nothing.  The stuffed avocado that I ordered was about the size of a golf ball, to boot.  The only good thing was that it arrived nice and piping hot.  (Thanks, longhorn delivery!)  Usually I'd try to give a place a second try, but considering just how bad it was and how many other great options I have in our fair city, I think I'll pass.
