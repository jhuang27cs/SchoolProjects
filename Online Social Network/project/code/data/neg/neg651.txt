went here during happy hour with 3 other girls..
total disappoinment........ especially, those servers look  very frustrated and not willing to serve any more people. When we walked in, there were little dirty orange smelt eggs around 2 tables, and  the guy seemed very reluctant to let us sit there because he had to clean the table by himself with the towel( no busboy at that time.)  
albacore & egg sushi: bland........... especially the sauce they put on top of albacore was watered down soy sauce....
spicy tuna roll: mashed mediocre spicy tuna with sriracha taste.
spicy tuna salad: we were pretty sure we ordered spicy tuna salad. it looked like a plain sashimi spring mix salad...... leftover dressing on the bottom tell us that was spicy tuna salad.......
ordered 2 appetizers at half price : sesame chicken,and dynimate..
few shrimp and scallop pieces on top and all mashed up onions and veggies on the bottom with mayo.......... 
sesame chicken tasted worse than the one they sell at local chinese restaurant.

worst part: Reluctant to serve or SMILE attitude
especially 2 guys who work during happy hour.......
please, it's part of hospitality field.... LEARN TO SMILE!! or AT LEAST DO NOT SHOW ME YOUR FROWNING FACE.
