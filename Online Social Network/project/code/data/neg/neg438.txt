Locals recommendation.  Try this place once.

Go on a weekday or experience insanity.  Order your pizza for dine in (the to-go pies are significantly smaller) however the cafeteria style dining will make you feel like you're back in 3rd grade. Even comes with in house bullies(aka the staff)  So eat one slice, ask for a to go box (which will not fit the rest of your pizza) and run away!

The pizza is amazing... But the experience is so so bad that it is intolerable to make this place a regular dine. 

The front of the house staff is rude beyond belief. Especially the Snooky look alike.  I thought she was going to literally attack a fellow patron one day.  The kitchen staff appears to work hard, but if you go after 8 or 9 there is a large chance you will only be able to buy a margherita pizza because they are to lazy to add toppings.

To sum everything up.  I heard a new term people in the surrounding areas have coined to describe Antico.
