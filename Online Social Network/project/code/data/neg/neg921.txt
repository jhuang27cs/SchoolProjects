I would not recommend Christina Lesher because her office staff is rude and uncaring. Her website says they will give the elderly and disabled the diginity they deserve how about the mother of the disabled child? I called to make an appointment to set up a special needs trust for my disabled 5 year. Her staff talked down to me and was caustic. I made an appointment and agreed to the $350.00 initial fee only to be called back my some rude baby talking staff member to be told they didn't want to work with me. Wow. Houston's a big city and I can find someone else to write me up a special needs trust.
