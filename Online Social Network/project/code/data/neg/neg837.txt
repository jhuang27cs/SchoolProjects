It's always frustrating when you order a drink listed on their menu and it takes multiple members of the service staff to tell you what is actually in the drink....

My first thought is how open and cold the interior is in the winter. In the summer, sure, its spacious, but the open, mirrored look serves to make any cold air from the front door blow through the entire establishment. That's not too great.

It took an inordinate amount of time to get our food on one visit, and on another they forgot some of what we ordered. In both cases it was a head-scratcher as it wasn't particularly busy and we didn't have a particularly confusing order ("may I have a side of bacon" doesn't seem confusing to me). 

Another reviewer mentioned that they don't seem to have good systems in place, and I couldn't agree more. The disappointing thing for me is that the food was pretty good both times. But for a place behaving (and charging) as a higher-end establishment, there seems to be a significant lack of attention to detail. That's surprising and disappointing and gets you shuffled to the bottom of my "good ideas to visit again" rolodex (which of course I mean list on my smartphone, come on).
