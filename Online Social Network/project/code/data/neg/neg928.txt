Eh.
I got delivery with a few friends during a group all nighter. We got a 16in pizza and a box of mozz sticks and onion rings for under $20 with free delivery. Place is really cheap imo, but I'm Bostonian. 
Delivery took a while, and things came less than warm but not cold. Overall, it isn't awful, but I'm reluctant to call it good. I'm not totally sure how long it was sitting in the back of the delivery car, but the pizza came floppy in a semi-soggy sort of way (real pizza does not flop), and the sauce is too sweet for my taste. The onions were in this bipolar cooked/raw state, and so were my mushrooms. 
O-rings were real o-rings and not fracking onion straws, which I appreciated. They were fried, and greasy, and lovely, but strangely very flat and not very onion-y. They were very generous with our order. Mozz sticks were average, and they were less generous with these. 
I think I'll come back for calzones, but not for anything else.
