I went here to get a replacement driver's mirror for my car. I was excited that they had one and a decent price. I was being helped by a very nice gentleman until Frank got involved in our conversation. This idiot  starts taking over the order and evidentely orders the wrong mirror after me and his co-worker repeately tell him I need the Driver's mirror. Of course, I don't realize until I'm at the mechanic and they've removed EVERYTHING!!! 

I go back and specifically ask to speak with him. He does aplogize, but of course it's not helpful when my car is pretty much non-drivable now :( 
Luckily I spoke with Ruth before coming back into the store and she tried to get overnight shipping instead of the normal 3 day shipping like Frank was saying that's all he could offer. I'm still awaiting to find out if it came today, but looks like it didn't. 

Moral of this review: CHECK and VERIFY everything you order at the store!!!
