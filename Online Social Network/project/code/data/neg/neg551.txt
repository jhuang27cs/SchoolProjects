It pains me to give a cupcake establishment 2 stars.  really, it does.  but these cupcakes fit the "meh, i've experienced better" description perfectly.

I came here with a friend of mine and her two kids (ages 2 and 4) and while her 2 year old daughter ate her tiny chocolate cupcake like it was going out of style, her son got full after only eating the GIGANTIC serving of chocolate frosting.  I got the blueberry pancake cupcake (i love cupcakes, i love pancakes.  it had incredible potential.)  but i was sadly disappointed.  half the cake got stuck to the wrapper, so that sucked.  plus the frosting was enough to put me into a diabetic shock.  WAY too sugary.  i might give sweet another chance, because let's be honest, i love cupcakes too much to give up on them entirely, but i would steer clear of that pancake cupcake.
