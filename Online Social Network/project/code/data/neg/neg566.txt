This place is pretentious.. It's so expensive and the food is not exponentially any different than your other nearby Italian restaurants in the Claremont area. It's actually just plain ridiculous. I took my family here for my brother's birthday a few weeks ago. The experience was lovely because our server was sweet. He said he was going to make it special for his birthday. At the end of our dinner, he brings out the birthday cake that was the size of a dollar coin (I swear it was Hahahhaha) with 1 candle lit up. I appreciated the gesture at the time until I saw the bill & they actually charged me $10 for it Hahahhahaha I didn't even ask for it.. The waiter offered & yet charged it on me.  We had a fabulous experience as a family but I would never return to this establishment ever again. I'd prefer la picoletta.
