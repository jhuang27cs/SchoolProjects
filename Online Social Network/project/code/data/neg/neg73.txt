Firstly this is an overpriced place with horrible service. But that's not the issue.

They place fraudulent charges on your credit card. We had dinner over their sometime ago and paid our bill with 18% tip. But when I checked my credit card statement it was charged for a completely different and much higher amount. Later on they denied to provide any receipt or corrective measure of this.
