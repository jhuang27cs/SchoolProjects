I have never actually been to this clinic.  Not from lack of effort.  My neurologist referred me here.  I have really bad occipital headaches and need to get an occipital nerve block done.  Well, the doctor ordered for me to get an evaluation done first and then the procedure.  That's all fine and dandy except it's near impossible to make any appointment because these people don't pick up their phones and don't return calls!  Also, I was misinformed and told that I could get the procedure done in the ER if I wanted it done ASAP.  So I went to the ER thinking I would get some relief.  Nope.  They couldn't do it for me there.  The ER doctor was on hold with these people for 20 MINUTES.  AN ER DOCTOR.  She told them I was in the ER and they still said they could not do anything for me that day, but that they would expedite everything for me and I should be getting a call.  I still have not received a call (and yes I called them and they of course, did not answer).  I am done with these people.  I hope I don't need a referral because I am just going to go somewhere else to get this done.  I am in pain and need relief.
