very excited and delighted to learn that yogurtland was opening in norcal

prior to opening,  i would dream for the day where i would taste the delectable tart yogurt on my tongue.

i was so disappointed. i mean, it was alright. it was NOT AT ALL what i knew of yogurtland in irvine. 

i was looking forward to the TART TARO!! they didn't have it.
nor green tea, nor any of the asian-flavors. what the HECK! this one is completely different than the socal one .. it shouldn't even be named yogurtland! 

the yogurt was way too sweet too

my poor mother was looking forward to it too... she had no words.
