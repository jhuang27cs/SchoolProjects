"Don't do it, Dan, don't do it", I told myself.

I'll be eternally skeptical of chains in NYC, especially Mexican ones not named Chipotle (and even those). Mediocre friendliness + long wait for takeout + bland burrito for which they're named = no bueno. Friendly enough staff and the lunch special wasn't a terrible deal, but certainly no steal. Decor is a bit tacky, IMO, but those who liked it seemed to love it; didn't have any of their allegedly decent drinks.

All in all, I'd rather buy my own ingredients (and add nothing) and buy my own mini pre-packaged chips.
