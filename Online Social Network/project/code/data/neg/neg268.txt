Ugh. So not good food... although maybe that's because I was forced to eat here way too many times when I was on the CMU meal plan. The pizza is pretty bad, although the paninis are decent (but small). If you aren't on the mealplan, this is overpriced and not worth your time.

During off hours, this can be a fun place to sit around with friends... cozy couches, and nice windows to look out of. But during peak hours you definitely won't be able to find a seat.

Only redeeming factor IMHO: froyo. Usually 2 flavors are available, and it's pretty cheap-- about $2. Great for when you're having a rough day and just need a sweet treat!
