I've now been to Seva around four times and have the same experience every time: decent food at an exorbitant price (it would still be overpriced even it wasn't vegetarian, which says a lot), with small-to-modest portions.  This time I had the 'Grilled Tofurkey Sandwich' with "cheese," guacamole, and dressing on multigrain bread for $10.95.  I was expecting a fairly thick slice of tofurkey and was disappointed to only get two thin deli-meat style slices.  It also took a pretty long time to get our food.  For the price, I'd rather (and could) go somewhere with (a bigger portion of) better food and atmosphere, so I'll save my expensive sandwiches for somewhere else.
