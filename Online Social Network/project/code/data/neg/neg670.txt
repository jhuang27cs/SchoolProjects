Look, I know you don't go to a place like Heroes for the service. You go because the food is decent and the beer selection is enormous. I get that, I really do. But there's a minimum level of acceptable service in any restaurant, and Heroes ain't meeting it.

When I walked in here around 6:50 tonight, I noticed that the place wasn't very busy. I'd wager there were 6 tables in use when I came in, with me making a 7th. I couldn't find anyone to direct me to a table, so I asked the (not very friendly) bartender if I should seat myself. "Any table that's clean" was the response. Fine, okay, no problem. I can deal with seating myself.

I grabbed a seat and the aforementioned not-very-friendly bartender came by to ask what I was drinking. I ordered a beer, which he brought very promptly. He returned a few seconds later, threw some menus and peanuts at me, and zipped off.

From the moment he departed, it was 20 minutes before someone came by to take my order. I imagine I could've waited a lot longer if I didn't finally flag someone down myself. Again, I get that service isn't why someone comes to a place like this, but I expect that a server should come by within the first ten minutes or so (especially on a slow Wednesday night) to take my food order. That's just common courtesy.

After I ordered my "black and blue burger" (which was merely average, by the way, though the curly fries were quite tasty), it was probably another 15 minutes before said burger arrived.  After that, I didn't talk to another server again until I flagged one down to bring me my check. No one came by to ask how the burger was or to see if I wanted another beer. Again, this is just basic courtesy in a restaurant.

Considering that the food wasn't really to die for, I doubt I'll be visiting Heroes again anytime soon. There's nothing heroic about bad service.
