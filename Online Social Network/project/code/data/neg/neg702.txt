Coming from a Chinese restaurant background, I can tell you that PF Chang's is a bit over rated.  The prices are a bit high for the portion one gets, and the food is a bit too salty.  You are mostly paying for the atmosphere.

The drinks are good but also overpriced.  I recommend one going to a local BYOB chinese restaurant, like First Wok near Hightstown.
