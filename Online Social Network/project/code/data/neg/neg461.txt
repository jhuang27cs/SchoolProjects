What was good:  The delivery speed on a snowy day.

What was bad:
1)I ordered 4 tacos for $2.50 a piece.  They were all lacking in non-tomato based items. The tacos I ordered were the fish taco, Jamaican Jerk Salad Taco, Chicken Tingas Taco, and the Portabello Mushroom taco. I'm pretty sure the fish taco was a taco with fish sticks on it.  The tingas taco came with more than just some lime juice coated on the chick but an 8th of a lime with skin and all which I unpleasantly found after biting in the my mountain of tomatoes, no chicken --chicken tingas taco.
2) I can go to Taco Bell and get the same quantity and quality for 1/4 the price.

I've given Tios many chances since 2006 and I have to say nothing has changed. Less than mediocre and very overpriced. I'm done with Tios.

Son I am disappoint. :-[
