I love Southern food and soul food, and the idea of a higher-end Southern food place made me a tad uneasy. Nevertheless, I heard about this place on an airline magazine and was excited to try it.

I think all my fears were proven true, however. The portions were tiny (heaping portions are essential in Southern cooking imo), the ambience was nice but way too classy, and the collard greens were undercooked and overwhelmingly salty. The menu selection was also extremely limited.

I guess mostly, for the price, I was a little mad. It wasn't terribly innovative. Tupelo down the street is much better (less expensive, larger portions, more extensive menu, bolder flavors), and Redbones does all that this place does and more.
