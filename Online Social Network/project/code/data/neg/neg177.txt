I used to LOVE this place.  I feel it has been on a steady decline in quality over the last few years.  I wonder if they have different management.  I went last night and my beloved fish tacos tasted off.  Couldn't shake the thought that they tasted like they had dunked the fish in dishwater before putting them in my taco.  They were soggy, the fish looked a little gray, and the seasoning tasted wrong.  The cabbage didn't even taste fresh.

This was the first time I noticed them bringing food to the table, so that's new.  Wish they had kept the cool aquarium, my kids used to love that.
