Oh Megabus, how I want to love you, but you make it so SO hard for me. I was able to forgive your less than punctual (read: extremely late) departure and arrival time, as well as your spotty at best internet, but your lack of climate control (read: no air conditioning) and belligerent drivers were just too much to handle. I've taken a Megabus on at least 10 different occasions, once all the way from Philadelphia to Knoxville, TN (with a connection in Washington, DC) but I normally just go from Philly to New York or Philly to Boston, and each trip has been at least 30 minutes behind schedule. The main reason I kept going back to Megabus is the super cheap price but after having a bus driver that was actually falling asleep at the wheel and swerving between lanes I swore I'd never risk my life on one again. For those of you who have traveled on the infamous "Chinatown Buses" I would say that the Chinatown ones might actually have better drivers, and that statement alone should give you pause when deciding on your method of transportation.

Let me cut this short before I scare away all of their potential customers, but unless you are extremely strapped for cash and need to get somewhere immediately, choose another method of transport, your sanity and life aren't worth risking.
