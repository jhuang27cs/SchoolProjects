First off, no pickles in the establishment (I was told they have cucumber.  Not the same thing.)  Humus was yummy and garlicy, but flavor was drowned by insane amount of red onion.  
Falafel was a multicultural experience: 
- served in tortilla rather than pita
- hot sauce was sriracha
- iceberg lettuce from cali (speculation)  

Falafel itself was strangely familiar - on third bite or so I recognized it from the boxed Fantastic brand I make at home + parsley and deep fryer.  The guy was nice and service was super quick, but he put an entire red onion's worth of bad breath on the sandwich.  Ugh.
