I rarely slam businesses on Yelp, because I understand that people can always have an off day or whatever. BUT SERIOUSLY? 

I always see Jimmy Johns commercials but had never tried it until today. Their tag line is "freaky fast delivery" and it was far from it. I placed my order online and waited 20 minutes for it to be delivered. Honestly, the JJ is only a few blocks from where I live. I probably could've walked there, ordered the sandwich, walked back in half the time it took for it to be delivered. Not to mention, I placed the order at 2pm so I doubt they were busy in the store. When the guy arrived downstairs, I buzzed him up. It took him another 5 minutes to get to my apt. I don't know what took him that long. He looked sweaty and out of breath from running when he got to my door. I have no idea why, since it took him FIVE MINUTES to get to my door. Trust me, the building is small and I live only on the 3rd floor. I still gave him a tip.

The whole time I was waiting, I was thinking "This is going to be an awesome sandwich." Fast forward to when it arrived, it was a sad, cold sandwich. The french bread wasn't toasted, it was completely cold. When I opened up wrapping, it looked like there wasn't even anything inside the french bread. That's how little was inside the sandwich. It was probably the most boring, unfulfilling sandwich ever. 

Should've just walked to Quiznos or ordered a pizza instead.
