**This review is just for laundry pickup/delivery service**
I used to think this place was ok but they've just become so unreliable. The laundry is NEVER ready when they say it will be and sometimes when they send someone for pickup in "20 minutes", I've waited for more than an hour.
Sigh.
I'm gonna have to find a new place.

Also, the laundry does come back really reeking of soap.
