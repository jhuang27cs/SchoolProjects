Through another club owned by the same entity, I have been attempting to contact the owner as I know that if I was the owner of this club, I would want to put the GM in check.  Boy was I wrong, the owner could care less and shown me that by not communicating with me at all.  
I used to think this was the best club I could find in the La Jolla area.  Boy was I wrong.  I'm happy to have joined another club, for half the price, with excellent customer service.
