What is the problem with this side of Mass Ave (MIT side) and lunch/food options? Steam Cafe is yet another example of a place that I frequently frequent yet frequently walk away from feeling frustrated with both the food and the funds left in my fallet. (ok, wallet, can't quite get that to work.)  

So yes, it's true that you can get an entire plate full of rice for $1. But the food that goes on top is well, just kind of glop. The same stews with incredibly soggy vegetables week in and week out -- it's kind of like bad dining hall food from the 80s, before America realized that Chinese food was more than just greasy La Choy lo mein. And at $4 for a small cup (rice is separate, and you can't really buy a reasonable amount of rice -- even a small is a lot), I don't find Steam particularly inexpensive either. 

Perhaps I wouldn't be so disgruntled if there wasn't an architecture cafe on the other side of Mass Ave that offered way better food for way lower prices. (For example, a plate of freshly carved lamb, a large portion of vegetables, and a mixed rice for $5, not to mention the salad bar.) MIT is awesome, but can't we do better than this food wise? 

Bottom line: better than the Goosebeary's food truck, not as good as Anna's but more convenient, less oil laden Shinkansen, and worst case scenario, they always have a bottle of Sriracha out which helps.
