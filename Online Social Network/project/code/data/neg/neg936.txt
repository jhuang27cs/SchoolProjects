I lived in Costa Verde North Village and we were told that AT&T Uverse was available in our building FINALLY! we were waiting to get ride of time warner. Well dont let them trick you, first it wasnt hooked up to our apartment building when the tech came out then they had to install it then come out again and we have had horrible connections ever since our service is not 100% its at 90% meaning the connections are weak and need to be changed by the apartment complex not AT&T, so now after 1 week and 4 techs coming out to try and fix this we have to go back to Time Warner!
