I feel bad giving this place one star.... but it's so not good!
Cupcakes are very trendy right now, so I was excited to see this cupcake place in Princeton.

Let's break it down.

The cupcakes-
They DID have a good amount of flavors to choose from.. I'll give them that! However, they were NOT tasty at all ! They tasted like hostess or something you'd buy at a supermarket! Definitely not bakery fresh. The icing was way too sugary as well.

The store is very strange.
The walls are lime green if I remember and it's like bare inside. They give you the cupcakes in this plastic container, it's weird.

They need to improve their concept, decor, and most importantly, cupcakes! If they do this, I might reconsider!
