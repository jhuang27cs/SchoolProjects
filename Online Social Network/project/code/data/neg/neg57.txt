4:30 pm at the post office, ogre says there's no tape to shut the envelope of the package. NO TAPE AT THE POST OFFICE, serious?????? 

my boyfriend goes next door to ABP to get tape, comes back, ogre tells him to go the back of the line. it's 4:50pm. she then shuts the gate and says, no more services and told him to go home. 

WTF???
