I was at work, and was craving for some Mexican food. I happened to find this place and I decided to give them a chance. I ordered the mole verde chicken lunch special, which came with salad, rice, and beans.

Pros: The black beans were good, and were a welcome surprise, because I figured that they'd serve pinto beans.

          The salad was nice.

Cons: The salad was in the same container as the food, so the steam pretty much wilted the whole salad.  And I really wish restaurants would stop using Italian dressing as their go-to dressing. It's tangy and overrated.

          The chicken was bland and pink. I felt kinda queasy after eating it.

           The tortillas were actually corn tortillas that were wrapped in foil, so the steam rendered them soggy, gross, and inedible.

I probably won't order from them again. Get some Goya seasoning in your life, man. 

Everything came up to $10.87
