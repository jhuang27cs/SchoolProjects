USBP! IN DA HOUSEEE

CHOO CHOOOOOOOOOOO!

I dunno, this place has SUCH potential, but each time I go there I get disappointed. Decor is great, staff is extra friendly, and they have some interesting beers on tap. (Hopocolypse was great) I went here with a large party that we had reserved a spot for. But it seemed like one waitress had to handle the whole place/restaurant. She almost sprouted rabbit ears and a pocket watch, hopping around yelling ,"I'm late! i'm late!" ...Almost..

Drinks took 45 minutes to get a refill, and the food was mediocre. The beer I did actually enjoy! But it would of been nice to get more than 2 beers in the couple hours we were there. The food was just kind of bland, waited a half hour for the honey mustard I wanted to go with it. So by the time I got that my food was cold. Food came with french fries which I hate, wanted mashed, but couldn't get a word in edgewise to even see if the sandwich came with a side at the time.

I don't know if this place is bad, or I just have really bad luck here the past couple of times, or maybe they don't have handling large parties down yet? I MIGHT try this place out again if friends want to go, or I get a gift certificate/coupon, and I'll update my review.
