I used to work at Cinnabon so I came in here expecting a lot and unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Even with the discount, these cinnamon rolls were expensive considering what you get.  Old cinnamon rolls (obviously not baked within the last half hour like at Cinnabon) and boy were they tiny.  I guess it's only worth it if you want a vegan cinnamon roll but if you're looking for a good cinnamon roll I would drive to the nearest Cinnabon.
