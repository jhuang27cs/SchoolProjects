DO NOT GO TO ALL YOU CAN EAT Sushi

I was really excited to hear about Pod's promotion for all you can eat sushi. I think in theory it was a great idea. However, in practice it was a nightmare. We had a reservation for 9:45pm, we were seated at 10pm. After following the strict orders about what you can and cannot order, we ordered with our waitress who I must say was really friendly. We waited an hour and ten minutes for 2 maki rolls, 1 hand roll and a few pieces of nigri. The manager came over and apologized for the wait and gave us free pot stickers. We decided not to wait another hour and a half for our second serving of "all you can eat sushi" and left. The staff was nice and only charged us $25 but it still was not worth the price or wait. As we left we could see probably 50 other tables that did not have food either. I would go back, but not for an all you can eat sushi night.
