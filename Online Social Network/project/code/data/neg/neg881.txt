What is wrong with that guy?  Seriously, playing Pok√©mon in the middle of his shift? Not a huge deal.  Not having a big selection of cookies? Fine.  His attitude? Unacceptable.
I have a dairy allergy (not lactose, but actual protein) and wanted to know if I could see an ingredient list.  The guy said I should not eat any of them. "Have you ever even MADE cookies before?" he snapped.  Well yeah, you a-hole, and none of the cookies I have ever made included dairy unless I used milk chocolate!  Eggs, yes! Dairy, NO. The other guy working was going to grab the book with ingredients, and the kid screamed at him saying it was against policy.  He then told me he was having a bad night and "didn't need" me in his store.  Well I am pretty sure he NEEDS a job, and I am hoping management fires this jerk.  I didn't make his night bad; all I wanted was to know if I could eat the sugar cookies.  He threatened to call the police on me and said he didnt want to use force to escort me out.  Pardon me, but I am a 5'4" young woman that was simply requesting allergen information.  Someone really needs to pay closer attention to who they are hiring to represent their business.  Sheesh.  This experience left a bad taste in my mouth without even having a bite of a cookie.
