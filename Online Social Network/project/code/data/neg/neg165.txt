Okay, Douglas, you cannot give a Holiday Inn 5 stars.  Think about it.  If the Holiday Inn gets 5 stars, what does the Westin get? 10?  What does the Fairmont get? 15?  The grade inflation on yelp is retarded and you're not helping anyone by doing that.

This is a 2 star hotel.  yes, the staff is kind, there is a pool, and a small workout room.  But the infrastructure is poor.  I'm listening to both my neighbor's television right now, and my other neighbor switching his lights on and off.  I'm not kidding.  The walls are that thin.
