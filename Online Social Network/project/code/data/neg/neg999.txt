The place is located inside University Village at the Village Fair international food court. This is probably the most popular but not necessarily one of the better places to eat at. They have a bunch of specials but I ordered #16 - the kim chi fried rice with beef. It also comes with a small miso soup and medium soda. The special is $7.85+tax, which isn't bad.

If you don't feel like going all the way to Koreatown, this place is...okay. Actually no, it's not okay. The quality of the food is mediocre and the taste is inconsistent. I guess it depends on who's doing the cooking that day. The miso was salty and the beef fried rice tasted like it was fried in oil that was used one too many times.

Well, at least the portions are generous and there's plenty of free parking.
