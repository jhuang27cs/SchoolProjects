This place did a terrible job! My husband went there for a haircut and mentioned to them that he had been to the Aveda Institute in Indianapolis and they assured him that they were not the same. That's for sure! He came back after an hour with uneven sideburns (one was a half inch shorter than the other. how does that happen? use the ears as guideline...) and with his bangs cut at an angle. 

His stylist was rude, shoved his head when she needed to move it to cut, and rested her hip on him instead of standing up straight. 

Although it was cheap, only 12 bucks, I wouldn't risk saving a few dollars in exchange for a bad haircut. Maybe if you got a different stylist than he did, you'd have better luck.
