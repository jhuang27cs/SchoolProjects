OMG! I usually love Trader Joe's but going to this location is worst than getting a root canal.  First off the parking in this particular spot is horrid...it takes forever to find a spot and I almost always barely escape an accident everytime.  Then I finally get into the store and they never seem to have one of my staple TJ necessities.  The help staff is the only saving grace but the parking and stock supply just seem to always be an issue.  I would go to any other Trader Joe's before going to this location.
