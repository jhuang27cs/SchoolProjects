Warning: Stick to pub food and don't get adventurous with their 6 page menu.  I learned my lesson by ordering the fish tacos and they were among the worst I've ever had.  The fish were fried pieces of blandness with not much else on the taco to flavor things up.  The service was below average (our waitress was out of it).  However, the atmosphere is actually pretty fun with a wide open bar and plenty of seating, both at the bar and on some comfy chairs.  My impression is mostly the science folks who work nearby tend to hang here.  

All in all, Asgard is best enjoyed as a place to hang with friends and grab a beer.  By the way, when I went on Monday night, they were having 10 cent wings at the bar.
