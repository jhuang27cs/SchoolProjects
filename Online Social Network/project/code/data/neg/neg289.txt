Perhaps the fact that we encountered "cheerleader night" will color my review, but my wife had cajoled me for months to sample this establishment as a quality venue. As we sat, considering our options, our server, John, upon hearing that we were considering leaving for a more familiar and reliable location, convinced us that regardless of our choice, we would be equally inundated elsewhere with the annoyances of young children running about, unattended and/or oblivious to their guardians.

With thanks to John, we stayed, as the buzz of unattended children diminished.

That said, we remained and sampled that which most appealed to us from the menu. 

The Blue Crab Cake was delicious, though highly priced for a singular cake that lasted but a few moments. The Lobster Ravioli, which was highly recommended by our server, contained large chunks of lobster, a plus, yet the ravioli and sauce left much to be desired. Many locations on Atwells Ave. have far surpassed the quality.

We left for the evening with only the memory of our quality server, John, as a worthwhile memory with which to take with us.

We will give this establishment another look, but for now, we suggest holding true to those reliable choices such as Capriccio's, Camille's, The Blue Grotto, Hemenways, The Capital Grille, and more. These establishments will not disappoint.
