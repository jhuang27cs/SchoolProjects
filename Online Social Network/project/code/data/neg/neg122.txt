This place just opened by my work place.  It's refreshing to have something different/new after 11 yrs of the same thing... and I love asian cuisine so I was super excited to try it out.  Love the modern/trendy decor.  BUT the menu is lacking... no sushi, just a handful of basic teryaki dishes... I had the tempura don:  it had a lot of onions, good amount of shrimp (for the size of the bowl which was small), 2 pcs of zuchini and a slice of sweet potato over steamed rice and soy sauce for $8.50.  My friend had the Tori Kara Don which is fried chicken and egg over steamed rice for $7.95.  Neither did much for me :-(
