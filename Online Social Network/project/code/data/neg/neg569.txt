I feel bad writing a review when I've only been to a place once, but my experience was not great.

Service was ok. No one ignored me or was rude, but nothing special.

The d√®cor is a little quirky... can see how some people would like it. It was a little on the chintzy side for my tastes.

The food? God-awful.  I ordered an avacado/crab/cucumber salad.... which was bits of those three ingredients with a small amount of roe mixed in tons of mayo. SO GROSS. I was hoping for an actual salad... or possibly even more cucumber to give it crunch? The cuke was cut so small and thin, that it was mushy... along with everything else. Flavor was also terrible, since the mayo drowned everything else out.

Scallion pancakes... so flavorless and greasy. Just disgusting... it made my stomach churn.
