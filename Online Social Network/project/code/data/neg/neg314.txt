Here's the heartbreaking thing about Baraonda:  you cannot enjoy their truly delicious Italian cuisine for the techno-beat pumping through the restaurant. 

As other reviewers have noted, this dimly-lit, perfect date/anniversary/business lunch or dinner locale is completely ruined by the head-thumping music. The couples sitting to either side of me tonight had to yell to talk. My friend and I heard their entire conversations (made easier, of course, because we could not have a conversation at all due to the music and subsequent yelling.)

This restaurant is obviously prouder of its sound system than its food. Truly, it's sad.
