I stopped here because I had some coupons and didn't feel like cooking or eating anything remotely healthy after a long day at work.  The sandiches were supposed to be buy one, get one free but somehow the cashier charged me an extra $.20.  It wasn't that I couldn't afford the twenty cents but the principle very much irked me, especially when he refused to give me a receipt and said, "Wel, it's only $.20.  It's basically nothing."  Yeah, tell that to someone in Shanghai who could buy a breakfast with that money.  Anyhow, I did eventually get my money.  The grilled chicken sandwiches were a bit dry and definitely not as big as the ones from Burger King.  I think that I'll stick with the nuggets next time...and a different location.
