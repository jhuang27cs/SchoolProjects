Compared to Korean food in other cities, the offerings in Champaign-Urbana are quite dismal.  Unfortunately, Woori Jib falls within this category.  Sampling of the "standard fare" (Bulgolgi, spicy tofu soup, mackerel, etc.) revealed that is food is not seasoned well, much of the BBQ is rather fatty, and overall quite "rough" and unappealing in appearance.
