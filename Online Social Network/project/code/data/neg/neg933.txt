Great fast delivery, and great prices.

The food, however, was not so great. Not terrible, mind you, but not very flavorful or carefully-prepared. I ordered the Peking Ravioli, General Gau's Chicken, and Vegetable Delight, and my girlfriend described it all perfectly as "how Chinese food would taste if we tried to make it ourselves without a good recipe." Much of it was bland and either over- or under-cooked, and nothing was particularly good.

Order from Pu Pu Hot Pot if you're on a seriously tight budget and just want something fast, but otherwise take a look at some other menu.
