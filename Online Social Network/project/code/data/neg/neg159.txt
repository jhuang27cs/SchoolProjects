Service is slipping.  I frequent this particular Starbucks often and I was appalled when my family of 6 recently stopped in.  Apparently dropping 6 coffee orders on them was overwhelming! (These guys better not move to Chicago or New York any time soon if they can't handle 6 coffees) What really chaffed me was the fact that they got one of the orders wrong and my adult son courteously pointed out that his order was incorrect.  The barista proceeded to instruct him on what he had ordered instead of owning up to the mistake.  He took what she made him without making a scene but what happened to the customer is always right?  PS  He orders the same thing every time so I know she messed it up.
