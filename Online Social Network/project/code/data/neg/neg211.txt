EDIT 12/30/2007: I'm downgrading my review from 4 stars to 2. The crowds at The Real Chow Baby very often border on ridiculous, and parking is still a hassle because the garage next door fills up. When I come in for a late lunch (145pm) on a weekday but still have to wait almost 30 minutes for food, and then come back for lunch another time and the parking lot is full... sorry... I love your food, but you are just not worth the hassle anymore TRCB.

There's a new place in town called Hot Stix which is the same type of restaurant, with the same great food but a lot less of a wait. Its located in the new retail complex at Lindbergh.

=== Original review:

Recently, Atlanta finally got a real mongolian BBQ. Way to catch up with the rest of the country! (Don't try to claim that roach motel up in Cobb is a mongolian bbq)  I've eaten at numerous Mongolian BBQ places in other cities, including chains like BD's, and several independent restaurants. 

The Real Chow Baby beats them all on the dizzying array of vegetables, sauces and noodles/rice available for your dish, plus they offer several options such as making your dish into a wrap or serving warm bread with it, etc. The one place where I felt TRCB was weaker is in the selection of meat. Last time I went there it was beef, chicken, sausage, and something seafood (forgot what)... but no sliced pork?! 

Regardless I've always been pleased with the dishes I've made. :)

The other thing I like less about TRCB is the wait time. The lines can seriously be 20 minutes or more just to get your food to the cook, then you add in the time waiting. 

Its a reasonably cheap meal, always exactly what you wanted, and free valet parking.
