DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! 
Wow the service is sooooooooo bad at Rock Bottom. I work for a very large well known company and we decided to have a happy hour at Rock Bottom on a Wednesday. When I got there the bar area was packed but not overly busy. I stood at the bar to get a drink and not one bar tender asked what they could get me. So I then ask a waitress for a drink menu, she said she doesn't have one but will get me one. She never comes back. 20 minutes have passed as I've been standing waiting to order a drink and get service basically looking like an idiot. My co-workers show up so we decide to get a table on the patio. The waitress finally greets us, is very rude but we ordered drinks finally but then WE NEVER GOT THEM! nearly an hour had passed. It was absolutely the worst service I've ever seen in the San Diego area. They said they just got new management, WOW, simply pitiful! 
I doubt there was even management around just grumpy services/hostess/and bartenders that could give to craps about a TIP, making business, or customers. WE LEFT!!! El Torito has a much better happy hour anyway.
