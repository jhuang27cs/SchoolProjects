I went to Motav for dinner and was very disappointed.  This is different than going to Motav the nightclub (which is also lame).  They bill themselves as a gourmet hamburger restaurant, and I would give them four-ish stars on the food, except the two times I've eaten there the service has ruined my experience.  The final straw was when the  bartendress asked us to close out out tab because her shift was over, which is understandable.  What isn't is when we were ignored for 20 minutes (I guess she didn't want the tip) while over five bartenders passed by us and ignored the credit card on top of our tab.  We arrived at 7 to grab a quick bite but walked out at 9:45 because the service was so slow.  I'll never go back.
