After my second experience with Upper Crust, I'm very unlikely to be their customer again.  I had a pair of pizzas delivered to my house, a Pollogo Pesto and a John 'Chief' Bucyk.  Delivery was fast and friendly.  The pizzas arrived hot.  They just were BAD.

Both pizzas were very greasy and very salty.  I'm not overly sensitive to pizza being greasy; sopping up grease off the top before eating a slice does not detract from my enjoyment.  But these pizzas weren't just greasy on the top, they were greasy through and through.

Perhaps most damning, the crust was horrible.  I like most styles of pizza, if done reasonably well.  The crust wasn't light and crispy, nor did it have any bready, yeasty quality.  It was like a piece of cardboard soaked in grease.

I wish Emma's would deliver, but if I really don't want to leave the house, I'll order from Bertucci's.  I'm not saying I love Bertucci's, but Upper Crust pizza was disgusting.
