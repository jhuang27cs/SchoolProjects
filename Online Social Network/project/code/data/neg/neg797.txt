Been here a couple of times recently as it is right across the street from my girlfriend's house. The host is rude. He forgets that his job is to seat and serve. It always seems as though we are an inconvenience to him that we are there. We asked to sit in a place where we could see the NCAA Tourney. We told him we were eating dinner. He said the only place is in the bar. As he pointed us to the bar, we took the high-top smack in front of a TV in the dining room. Thanks for a whole lot of nothing. Might as well be self-serve seating. 

The food though is good. Fish and Chips, Chicken Florentine -- both solid. Props to the BOH. Wish the FOH had a clue. It'd be 3 or 4 stars if the FOH was better.
