Oy Ray's.  I'm always so torn when I'm trying to review a restaurant that made a mistake, then rectified it... But I'm just not going to give more than two stars.  I refuse!

My fiance and I came here right before a party, looking to eat but not overeat.  I ordered their mexican veggie mix burrito bowl; he ordered their grilled cheese.

The grilled cheese came out... But the burrito bowl was nowhere to be seen.  We asked about it and they said it was coming.

It wasn't.

We waited about 15 minutes, still bowl-less.  The cashiers kept eyeing us confusedly without asking us what we were standing around waiting for, and finally we went back up and asked the SAME people about the burrito bowl.  They went into the kitchen, came out, and said it would be ready soon and offered us a cookie while we waited.   They hadn't even started making it.

So we just asked for our money back and told them not to bother.  We sat at a dirty table, I ate half of the grilled cheese, my boyfriend had the other half, and then they brought out the burrito bowl, telling us it was on the house.  No kidding-- we just got our money back because we asked.  But by then I had (not) enjoyed a half of a grilled cheese sandwich, and was suddenly faced with stuffing my face before the party we were now late to.

Like I said: oy Ray's.
