I went here because I was in the neighborhood and felt like getting a pedicure.  There was a sign on the sidewalk that said "Spa Pedicure $17.99."  Wow, what a great price!  I was expecting to get callous remover and french, which I know cost extra.  The lady who helped me was really sweet.  So I am getting my quick pedicure, she does a scrub, a quick paraffin, massage.  The wonderful place I usually go to asks if I want that and if so, how much extra.  No, not this place.  She does all of these quick extras and then says "$50.00."  Whaaaat? Excuse me?  Well, I paid and left since I had to be somewhere.  I will never go there again.  I will stick to my usual place.  I gave two stars because my pedicure looks nice.  I didn't want to get my nails filled there, but the lady kept telling me to come back for a fill because she will make my nails look nicer.  Yeah, for $80.
