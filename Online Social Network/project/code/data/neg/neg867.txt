Definitely not even close to the best Thai food in the city, but about as good as you're going to get in this neighborhood. The curries lack that kick of heat that I look forward to when I order curry. Takeout is dependable, service is always fast. Good in a pinch when you have a killer Thai food craving but don't feel like leaving the neighborhood.
