Disastrous lunch experience here. We were wandering around and hungry and this place promised pizza and tapas, both of which I like. We wandered in, and the space looked cheerful. Everything was fine until the server took our order and then gave us our beverages.

The food just wouldn't arrive. The folks at the table next to us were seated after we were, and yet they were mostly done with their lunch by the time our food showed up. At one point, our server asked us, "How is everything?" And I really wanted to blurt out, "What everything? We have no food!" She didn't really seem to be interested in getting our food to us, nor did she seem to have the slightest idea that a long delay would be annoying to guests at a restaurant.

When our food finally showed up, we realized that the people who designed the menu have no idea what words mean. "Tuna ceviche with crunchy taco" consisted of three or four slices of (not that fresh) tuna cut in an imitation of sashimi with some sweet-ish sauce, accompanied by greasy tortilla chips. If I hadn't been so annoyed, I would've actually found it funny that "beef brisket bbq with soft taco" translated into brisket (tasty enough) on pita bread and some form of tzatziki sauce. The beet salad actually delivered what it promised--beets, dressing, goat cheese, and watercress--and it was fine.

The high Yelp rating strikes me as completely misleading.
