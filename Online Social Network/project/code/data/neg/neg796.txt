I was a satisfied client of Shift until yesterday when Vicki ruined a hairstyle I loved and wanted to keep. It was the style Vicki had given me a few weeks earlier so I'm at a complete loss as to why she butchered my hair yesterday. I told Vicki that "I loved my hair exactly as it was and I just wanted a TRIM to clean up the ends. Vicki then proceeded to hack a bunch of layers into my hair that were NOT part of the style I had just told her I loved. Vicki even specifically asked if the longer length worked with my wavy hair and I said, very clearly, YES that's why I don't want any real length taken off. Did that stop her from taking too much length off my hair or stop her from hacking TOO MANY, TOO SHORT layers into my hair? Nope. It was like she just completely disregarded everything I had just told her. 

In the matter of an hour I went from a style I loved to a mess I can't get to look decent no matter what I do to it. I will now have to spend 4 to 6 months growing out this horrible mess Vicki left me with all because she clearly can't follow simple instructions to trim a style SHE gave me once before that was (emphasis on WAS) my perfect style.

I will NEVER return to Shift and I wouldn't recommend Vicki to my worst enemy.

PS - Shift was very nice about refunding my money for the botched haircut. The cut still looks horrible but at least I didn't have to dish out my hard-earned money for it.
