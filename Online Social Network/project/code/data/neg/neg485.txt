I came wanting to purchase a printer and a few other things.  I asked for help and was told to wait.  So I did for 20 minutes, then tackled a blue shirted person scurrying past me like a fearful creature awaiting to be pounced upon.  That person told me to wait because she got the manager for that department.  Then I awaited another 20 minutes.  Finally I left for Costco where I got what I needed ASAP.
