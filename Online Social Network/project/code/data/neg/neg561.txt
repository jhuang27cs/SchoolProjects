We stay with them for 2 years, paid our rent in time every month... However, we had problems countless problems with our apartment (ac didnt work, Squirrel made a hole in the wall, and many others) and we didnt got the respond we wanted.... 

In addition, when  we left the STOLE bc thats the word 80% of our deposit on BS!!! 

Never renting with them again... I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
