WORST BUBBLE TEA PLACE in AUSTIN. 

Tea Lounge up on Parmer blows this place out of the water.

Negatives:
Saw the employee microwave tapioca balls. No wonder they are always overdone and mushy. (have been the past 5 times I've been) 

Slow service. Looks like there are so many components in their drinks it takes forever! Not worth the wait

Less drink, more ice. They put lots of ice cubes that fill up half the cup so your drink is gone in seconds.

Expensive for quantity.

Small parking lot that is shared with several businesses and difficult to maneuver out on a busy 24th street

Positives:
None?

How this place has stayed in business boggles me? Slow services and bad quality tapioca balls. Does anybody buy the little trinkets in the store?? Need $5 minimum to use credit cards. Today, they messed up my order and my gf's order and didn't bother correcting them because it would take too long. Not coming back to this place.
