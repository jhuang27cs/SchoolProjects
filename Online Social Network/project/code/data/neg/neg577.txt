I agree with the comments about the service, curt and unfriendly. My experience was worsened by finding plastic in my masala....twice! The first time they apologized and brought me a new meal, when it happened a second time I just gave up and chose not to risk eating anything. I expected the server/manager to try and make this up to us, however they did not. I can't rate the food because I only had a few bites and gave up on eating after my find. Not a good experience.
