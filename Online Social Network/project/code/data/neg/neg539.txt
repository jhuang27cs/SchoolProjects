On the Border is a mexican chain of restaurants.  The particular location I am reviewing is in Princeton, NJ on Route 1.

About a year ago, I might have given this restaurant a three-star rating, however, the past several times that my husband and I ate at On the Border, the service and food were sub-par.  We were frequently given chips and salsa first, and then made to wait 5-10 minutes for a beverage.  Often, this beverage was desperately needed, because the salsa was so spicy that it would cause me to start coughing violently.  Also, the restaurant began to puree the salsa that they serve with their chips.  I suppose this was an attempt to make it last longer and to save the restaurant money, but it just created a watery, red slop that slid easily off of the chips and was not very enjoyable to eat.

This restaurant offers a variety of main courses and many "build-your-own" options, however they are, at best, average in taste and quality.  

If you're thinking of going out for mexican food, I would recommend Chapala in Hamilton, NJ on Route 33.  Their food is of a much higher quality.  However, they do not serve alcohol.
