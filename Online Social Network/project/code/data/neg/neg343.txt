As of today, it looks like they're renovating the place, probably spending a lot of money upgrading the decor. 

Unfortunately for the owners (new owners?) of Frizzante, the looks of the restaurant were never what kept people away. The service wasn't great, and the food was a few small steps up from Chef Boyardee. 

With no other Italian restaurants in this part of Harlem, it's hard to believe this place has trouble surviving.
