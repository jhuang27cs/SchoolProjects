Could no believe my mother and I paid over $10 for a small cone and a microscopic dish.  The prices here I think are absolutely crazy, and the Gelato isn't even made fresh there?

That was my first problem with the place.  I asked the girl if the Gelato is made fresh, and she responded yes.  But then when I questioned it because the Gelato was so hard, she admitted they order it from a place that makes it; then, it is shipped frozen.  

I'm not trying to sound like an ass, but if I am paying over $10 for two Gelatos, they should be freshly made that morning.  FAIL
