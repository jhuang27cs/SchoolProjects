Most unsatisfying eating experience in... ever? Mostly I'll be whining about the service and portions, so I still give the place 2 stars because the food itself is pretty good.

Not trying to be dramatic but, I paid 8$ for a tiny tiny tiny plate of eggplant beef stir fry over rice that is only worth about 3$ max. When I got my plate, all my friends commented on how sad it looked. Portions here are ridiculously small its a total rip off (for the rice plates).

How ridiculous are the portions? One bowl of rice with probably two spoonfuls of the entree I ordered. My eggplant dish had three pieces of eggplant. Three. ??? But for some reason, my friends' whose orders were a dollar more expensive had about three times my portion of food.

.... what? I lost it when I saw my plate of food. The taste is fine, actually pretty good, but the feeling of being ripped off coupled with super slow service means that I don't think I'd dare to go back and try again for fear of being angered again. :(


Did I mention there is a 18% gratuity automatically included? I ate here during lunch, we had a party of 6.
