I feel like a playground bully pushing kids off the swings when I admit that I'm not a fan of Dozen.  How can I turn my nose up at cupcakes?

I stalled on writing this review for a long while because I kept wanting to give Dozen another chance.  Maybe I didn't choose the right flavor.  Or I didn't go at the right time of day.  The cupcakes look pretty!  The employees are so nice!  A number of my friends, whose food tastes I mostly trust, are friends of Dozen.  There must be something wrong with me.  But, no more excuses.

The problem that's consistent with all the flavors I've tried is that the cake part is dry and often not flavorful enough, and the frosting is too sweet.  I want to taste more pumpkin flavor in the seasonal pumpkin maple cupcake and more banana flavor in the Elvis.  

The shop itself is tiny but cute and as I said earlier, the staff is friendly.  I still don't think I've reached the point at which I'll swear off Dozen completely, but I won't be visiting regularly.
