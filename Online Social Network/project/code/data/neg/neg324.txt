I actually cannot understand what people liked about this place. It was the worst food I have ever had at a Japanese restaurant and my friend and I both got ill from the food (we had totally different dishes). Details:
- even on a Saturday night the food seemed old and like it had been sitting around
- I ordered a noodle dish and tempura, both of which were clearly pre-frozen. The tempura was the worst I have ever had and tasted more like onion rings than lightly battered Japanese fare.
- My friend's dist, a beef and rice bowl, had only a few measly pieces of meat and was grossly greasy.

Honestly, we didn't dare eat the sushi here as the case looked dingy and the fish looked old. I am not an expert in Japanese food or sushi, but I know fresh food when I see it.

Did I mention they were BLASTING obnoxious music the whole time? Like absolutely full volume. 

Do not eat here.
