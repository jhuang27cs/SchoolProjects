Dear Tommy Doyle,
It's a beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon, 1:38pm.  There are people out and about, wandering around Kendall Sq, for what I can only think are a variety of reasons.  My friend, my kids and I are waiting for something at the Garment District to be ready, and we stopped in for lunch. 
The kids were hungry when we got here- that was half an hour ago. My daughter just got her drink. We never had anyone come to take an order, so I had to go inside to find the waitress, who is the only waitress, and who I just overheard telling the table next to us that it's her first day.  
That must explain why when I asked for the missing drink she giggled and said, 'I forgot!'.  No! Really?? And here I was just thinking you were consciously torturing a thirsty five year old.  Silly me!
Our sandwiches have arrived  now.  We have never waited so long for a grilled cheese with nothing. There is a hair melted into the side of my son's ham and cheese, but that happens.
I am not going to comment on the quality of the food, because I'm not tasting it (you can't judge a restaurant based on a grilled cheese sandwich, unless it's a really special grilled cheese sandwich.  This is not.), nor am I drinking anything special.  The lemonade is not too sweet.  Two stars for that.
So, Tommy, (can I call you, Tommy?) I have to think my enormous frustration of this moment might have been completely avoided had someone had the foresight to not assume the new girl could handle this section solo?
Whaddaya think?
