Eh. A potato spiral cut, then dipped into dried cheese powder. You know, the stuff that comes with your mac and cheese. Potato was not quite cooked and nowhere near resembled "crispy' 
The hotdog was OK, but I'd have preferred more description available for what I was getting. A panko breaded bacon corndog  was... surprising. 

A little expensive, 7 for a combo which is a hot dog  a spiral cut potato, and a can of soda. 

They are new and very eager to help, with 4 people behind the counter ready to assist, but in the end I don't think I'll be going back
