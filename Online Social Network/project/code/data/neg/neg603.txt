USE COUPONS WITH CAUTION!!!!

I recently went in with a coupon and ordered another item with it. After paying, I noticed the price didn't seem right. I asked the manager (who was the same person that rung me up) and he said he forgot to take off the coupon price. He fixed it once I pointed it out but later, I was telling a friend of mine about the situation and he said the same thing happened to him. Is this an unofficial official policy with this store? Of course I'll go back because it's KFC but I'll have to keep an eye on them during the transaction.
