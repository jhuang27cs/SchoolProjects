Totally unimpressed with this place. The food is OKAY at best, nothing to write home about. But I guess I had higher hopes considering this place is in La Jolla. The servers weren't helpful and were busy chatting and gossiping (I could hear them and it ruined my meal!). If I want cheap Americanized sushi, I'll go to PB or drive all the way to Sushi Diner.
