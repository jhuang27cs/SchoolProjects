I really don't understand the hype ... at all.  They have fantastic branding & marketing heads, that's all I have to say. :)

We were gifted two dozen Sprinkles cupcakes at our office last week and I tried some of the (1) Banana and (2) Red Velvet.  The Banana tasted like banana bread, in cupcake form, with a bunch of icing gooped on top of it.  The icing was so sweet and overpowering.  The Red Velvet had the same intensely, sweet, thick icing, the cupcake was pretty mild and flavorless.  The icing on the Red Velvet almost made me sick, because tasted like super-sugary cream cheese.  

After seeing the lines daily at this store, I was hoping for a little better experience. It's good...if you like thick icing & mildly flavored cupcakes.
