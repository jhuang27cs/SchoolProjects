Can you spell M-E-D-I-O-C-R-E? I've come to accept that I will just never find a decent cupcake in Seattle (at least until Crumbs opens a store here). I've tried the red velvet, triple chocolate, vanilla vanilla and chocolate peanut butter. Save for the last, they were all really bland, and the frosting just never tasted "right" to me. Also, the staff invariably are inattentive and kind of snotty. I only come here if dragged by a friend (99% of which are cupcake whores).
