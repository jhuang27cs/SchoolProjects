I'm done with Howie's.

I've been coming here since they opened and have had had a like-hate relationship with this place.  I really want to like it, but there are so many bad things about this place that I truly hate it.

They have taken the best things off their menu.  They opened with the best pizza and appetizer on their menu and proceeded to stop making them.

The management is terrible.  The service is downright awful.

The food is inconsistent.
