Unfriendly people, danger town crust and pretty overpriced. I don't dislike all of Pizza Pie-er's pies, I just haven't had a good overall experience. So now, after two attempts (one having been after a bit of drink which usually makes pizza like foods taste better) I can't see myself going back very often.  

The counter staff seemed impatient and standoff-ish, which was a big part of the negative, and I have to say that the pizza quality really seems to vary.  One of the times the dough was a nice chewy consistency, although I'm normally a thin crispy crust sort of person, but the other time I was ill-fated and received an under-cooked pie.

Pizza can be done much better that what is at Pizza Pie-er.  If you have a need, they're around but treat it as sustenance instead of gourmet and you'll be happy.
