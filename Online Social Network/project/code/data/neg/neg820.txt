Just dissapointed with their customer service : (
I placed a to go order and was waiting for my food but when my order was ready, the guy gave my order to another customer and she left the restaurant. After a minute, the guy realized he gave her the wrong food and told the cooks to please make another combo plate which I knew must of been mine. Rather than apologizing and being upfront, he just made me wait there until another order was made. Once it was made, he called out my order and I picked it up. Never did he apologize for the error. Unfortunately to make it worse, when I got home, I realized that I must of received the bottom of the chips container since they were all crumbs! 
Bad experience.
