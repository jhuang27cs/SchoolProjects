Habibi? More like Ha-bye-bye.

Tell, me is it really necessary for 2 people to be charged $60 for food and hookah? The place isn't a god forsaken fancy bistro or anything. The place actually looks more suitable for hippies, strippers, and drunks (minus the poles). The hummus was ho-hum, I remember taking more than half our food home in hopes of not having to eat it later. The hookah, well you can't go wrong w/ hookah. If given the choice, the only reason I'd go back to that place is for hookah only.

Somebody tell the owners to adjust their prices to match it's atmosphere and quality of food because they are in way over their heads.
