Okay...so I have heard some good things from a friend about Chu-Cho's, and I love Mexican food, so I've gone three times now with friends and family on different occasions. I just do not see what the fuss is about! First off, it is NOT Mexican food...I'm not sure what the genre of food it, but if you are wanting what I call "comfort" Mexican food, then go to El Mariachi! I went into Chu-Cho's the first time and was shocked to see 4 things total on the menu (and no enchiladas or burritos)! However, the other 2 times I have gone, there have been more menu items added. I am not going back because I just have not tried anything that tasted that good. Plus, I ordered the tacos (and I am a size 2) and I was still hungry afterward! The other problem with Chu-Cho's is the fact that they cost much more than the other Mexican places around. I would just say, avoid it, especially if you are craving Mexican food!
