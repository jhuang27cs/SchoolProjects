Updating my review because we sat at the bar and there were tiny browb German cockroaches eating crumbs of old food packed into the cracks between the wooden bar.  That's right; roaches ON the sushi bar, and not just one. We kept seeing them appear and disappear.  As if that weren't enough, we were completely forgotten about, and rather than stop by and apologize for forgetting us, our waitress just passed us off to another guy and avoided eye contact with us the rest of the time.  We canceled our order and left before our food arrived.  Bad waitstaff is something that happens in the restaurant business, I understand that.  But seriously, roaches in the bar? NOT ok.
