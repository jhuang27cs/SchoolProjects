9 tastes? The only taste I could detect was one: vinegar, and lots of it. Maybe it was just bad luck with the dish I ordered (vegetarian pad thai), but the tofu was swimming in an awful vinegar taste, the noodles were bland and the whole dish was wet and soggy.

My friends also remarked that their dishes were rather unremarkable -- bland and rather on the soggy side. To top it off, they gave me about a fist full worth of pad thai and then covered it with their gross vinegar tofu. What the heck?! 

On a funnier note, one of my friend's ordered something on their menu and the waiter said "Oh, that's very dry." My friend replied that it was okay and he didn't mind if there wasn't a lot of sauce, to which the waiter responded "No, it's gross. You don't want it, I'll bring you the drunken noodles instead." Funny, I guess, and I always like when waiters are up front about their opinions, but come on, if it's that horrible, why is it on the menu!? ANNNND why didn't my friend get a chance to order what he wanted?! A little rude if you ask me.
