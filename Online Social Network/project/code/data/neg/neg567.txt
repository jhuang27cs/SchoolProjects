I have a lot of fun these days but I don't drink beer, eat meat, sing at karaoke nights or embarrass my diminishing brain with trivia questions. I also enjoy beautifully prepared food, a nice selection of tea to accompany my lunch, fresh homemade French fries and creative recipes. And I've been to Ireland a half a dozen times where I landed in way too many Irish pubs. So maybe that's why I just do not click with Tommy Doyle's. 

My garden burger is always sadly dry and limp, my salads are filled with tasteless, hard tomatoes and iceberg lettuce, and the fish and chips are just blah. Gratitude and happiness related to the salt and ketchup. I use a lot of both when I come here. The service is often rushed and unorganized. And when I go with my beer drinking pals, they are typically told that several beers are not available. 

I really want to click with Tommy Doyle's due to the location which is close to my home, and even because of the name. I have always liked guys named Tommy. But there's not a lot of chemistry between me and Tommy Doyle. 

Maybe if I figure out the joys of beer drinking that will initiate a chain reaction. I'll get so wasted that I'll try karaoke, the audience will erupt with appreciation of my vocal ability and I will change my mind about Tommy Doyle's and fall hopelessly, blindly in love. I keep trying. We are neighbors.
