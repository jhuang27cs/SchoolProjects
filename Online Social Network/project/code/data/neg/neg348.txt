This was my experience:
When I received my vegetarian order - which was described as a potato and cauliflower cake in tomato broth - I started to eat it and could see there was something like cheese inside. I asked the waiter, is there cheese in this? I told him I was allergic to dairy. He said no, absolutely no cheese. I said thank you and kept eating. As I got halfway through this potato/cauliflower cake I kept spying in it some stringy substance that looked like cheese. I worried about getting sick. So I went back to the kitchen and said, is there cheese in this dish I am eating? I really am very allergic to dairy. My waiter came over and said no cheese. I said, are you sure? The cook overheard us and said yes there is cheese. The waiter turned to me and said, sorry yes there is cheese. ARghhhh!
