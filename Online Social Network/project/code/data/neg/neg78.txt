Market in the Square is what it is. An overpriced, subpar quality bodega that can be what it is because there's no other walking-distance option for people living in the Square. Emphasis on overpriced. The people who work here are generally apathetic and unhelpful as well - I once spent a few minutes describing 'fresh mozz' to the deli counter dude and he finally understood, giving me some in a bag and wrapped in paper. I get home to find the $8 mozz to be...big chunks of slized mozzerella. Lovely. 

I go here for sheer convenience reasons (such as needing a lemon or chocolate chips), but when Whole Foods/Trader Joe's/anything else decides to suck it up and land somewhere close, I sure hope this place goes out of business.
