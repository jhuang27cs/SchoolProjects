Definitely not the best Hot Topic I've been into - most of their collection is a small wall of shirts, clearance, and jewelry/hair dye. 
Come here for (sort-of-pricey) hair dye, novelty makeup, Twilight clearance. If you're looking for a specific band shirt, cheap piercings, or good music, I'd try down the street at Amoeba records or shop online.
Staff is pretty nice, I'll give them that.
