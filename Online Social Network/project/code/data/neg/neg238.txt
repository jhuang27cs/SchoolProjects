We'd heard some good things about the Commons, but frankly it was a bit of a disappointment. There were a lot of panhandlers (some dude asked my daughter for 75 cents), burnt-out looking hippies and shuttered stores. A concert was scheduled, but only six or seven people were in attendance. It all seemed a little sad and desperate. 

I must say that Angry Mom's Records was awesome though, an incredible selection of rare and obscure LPs, so if you are there and music is your thing, check it out.

Otherwise ... meh.
