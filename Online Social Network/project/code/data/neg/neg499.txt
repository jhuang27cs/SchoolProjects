They also go by the name Broadway Auto Sales. Some of the cars are priced way over market value/Kelley Blue Book. The salesman and the rest of the staff are polite. I went to purchase a vehicle and was assured that their mechanics (which are next door) has checked out the vehicle and no problems existed. I drove the vehicle to my own mechanic and noticed that both side mirrors (electric) where not at all working and the ac was blowing out hot air. I should have turned the car around right then, but I gave them a chance and took the car to my mechanic. Two hours later my mechanic calls and advises me not to buy the car unless they can sell the car far below market value. The transmission needed to be rebuilt, the AC needed to be replaced, and the water pump had to be replaced. I brought the car back to the lot and tried to negoiate. First they said nothing was wrong with the cars transmission (didn't deny or mention the other problems) and then said this car would not be worth it for me to buy it I felt the repairs were too much. I bid them farewell and made my exit.
