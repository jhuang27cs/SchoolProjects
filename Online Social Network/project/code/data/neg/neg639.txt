The quality of the ramen was very bad.  I came here today with two co-workers and the patio was completely empty.  We had originally thought it looked like it served pretty decent ramen and that it specialized in ramen, however, after we got there we found out that the patio is part of Tomodachi Sushi.  

I've read a few pretty bad reviews about Tomodachi but we figured we'd give the patio a chance.  We ordered the Shoyu Ramen and it was very disappointing.  The broth was almost tasteless.  They wouldn't even give us proper silverware even though we ate there - instead they gave us a plastic to-go fork, and no chopsticks (they did give us a proper japanese-style soup spoon though. When we asked for chopsticks they had to go into Tomodachi to get them for us.  

The ramen did not taste fresh, and the chasu pork that they gave had a thick layer or chewy fat and very very little meat.  My two coworkers dumped loads of Sriracha sauce into their ramen to make it palatable. I felt bad for them...

I won't be back, ever.
