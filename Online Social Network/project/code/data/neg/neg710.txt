I'm not much of a fan of Friendly Toast. I want to like them, but I just feel like they're trying too hard to be hip. The menu is packed full of items that have too many weird ingredients- like they're trying to be interesting but in the end it just doesn't taste very good. 

I will say that the pumpkin pancakes filled with raisinettes were a perfect late-night post-Kendall Square movie treat last fall (with a Pumpkin ale). That may have been my first visit to Friendly Toast and it was a happy one! Ever since then I've left disappointed.
