This place is so trashy I usually buy a pitcher for myself and drink right from the pitcher. Recently someone had the bright idea of hiring a band during BTC to create additional noise and decrease seating space on the patio.

A great place to come if you have to go out with friends or coworkers and don't want to hear a word they are saying.

The price of a pitcher hasn't matched the hour for years. The name of their happy hour should be changed from beat the clock to beat the wallet.

The funny thing about BTC is that you run into everyone you have met previously in class or at some party the week before. Forgot to get her number? Find her at BTC.
