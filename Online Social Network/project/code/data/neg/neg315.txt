Someone needs to bring a voice of reason to this 5 star mania!
The coffee here is pretty good, but it's not enough to stick five gold stars all over. 

Also, the baristas have attitude, yet I can not pinpoint which one is the worst offender  because the majority of them have longish, blackish, jaggedish hair with black thick rimmed glasses. Sneaky.
