I came here for Sunday's brunch.  Had a reservation beforehand, so I was seated right away.  Great, right?  Not quite.  The waitress was slow - I tried to signal her a few times that my table was ready to order... still nothing.  I then got up and went to find her to let her know my table was ready to order.  Still took a while for her to get to my table.

The food isn't great enough for me to have to deal with poor service.
