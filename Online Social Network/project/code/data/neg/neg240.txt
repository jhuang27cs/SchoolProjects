This is a great study spot but I would not be here if not for the free wi-fi. If you think this is good boba.. you haven't tried honey boba that's chewy and sweet. This boba unfortunately falls short, due to inconsistency in the quality of their boba. Sometimes hard, sometimes chewy, sometimes a combination of the two. I'm sorry but I can't call this real boba.
