This place was terrible! Bad decor and bad lighting aside, the food was pretty bad. One of us had the bulgogi, which was oversweet and pretty fatty. I had the grilled mackerel, which was clearly frozen, dry and chewy. The kids shared the japchae, which was soupy and blah. The miso soup was empty--just miso and scallions. The one nice part was that they gave us shumai on the house for the girls. Overpriced too--had we paid for the 6 shumai, it would have been $6.95. Bulgogi was $18.95. Won't be back.
