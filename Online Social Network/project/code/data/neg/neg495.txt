Disclaimer: Korean food in the SF Bay Area is excellent, and that's the quality I'm comparing this to here...

Very underwhelming. I came here with a couple of friends I was visiting at Ann Arbor. We each got something different. I usually love bibimbap but not the one I had here. Ingredients didn't feel completely fresh, and maybe the rice wasn't warm enough because the egg didn't cook right on top of it. I could be just used to really good bibimbap...
