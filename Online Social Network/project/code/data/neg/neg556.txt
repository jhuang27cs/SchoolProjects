WTF. This is not a baguette. This is a soggy sub. No one in the world would order diced tomato, shredded old mozzarella and basil pesto on a soggy white sub. They would order tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil pesto on a BAGUETTE, which is what the menu said I was ordering. Worst $13 I ever spent. Positives: friendly deliver driver, convenient hours. Also, wtf happened to pretzels?
