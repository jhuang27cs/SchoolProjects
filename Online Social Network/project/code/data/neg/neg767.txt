I'm being generous with the 2 stars.

Seriously, worste customer service. No matter what time of day, always a bad experience. "My machine that prints that is down and we don't know when it will be fixed." I get it, you dont love what you're doing, you're just working to get by, but really what with the attitude. The girls that work here are like veteran cholas that have been in too many fights with their baby's daddy. 

Incredibly under-staffed and the ones that are there could care less about what you need or want. Jerry (looks like a lumber jack) was cool, and was apologetic at least about the print job not getting done when I needed it. I am a super calm customer so I won't yell about it but I do expect some form of good customer service to offset everything else. 

I can go on but I won't. All you should know is if you need a job processed here make sure to give yourself plenty of time before its actually needed. Expect errors, delays, misplaced paperwork, etc etc.
