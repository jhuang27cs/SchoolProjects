I've only had the curries (red and yellow) and I've only gotten food to go. 

Both curries were on the runny and flavorless side. I guess if I wanted soup I'd order soup.  Ingredients are pretty sparse, especially the vegetables, which doesn't make much sense to me. And both times I've ordered it 5 star spicy and I get it marked with 3 stars. 

It's not expensive, but it's not that great.
