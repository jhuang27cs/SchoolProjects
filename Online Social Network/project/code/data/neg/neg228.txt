Like another reviewer, I recently moved here was was looking for a female OB/GYN.  Since I use Yelp for everything, I turned to Yelp for my OB/GYN recommendation too.  I came in for a well woman exam and a preconception consultation.  

Overall, the in-office experience was nice.  The waiting room is nicely decorated, and the staff is knowledgeable and organized.  I saw Dr. Beard, and she was super friendly and sweet.  She was informative and had a warm personality.  I enjoyed the in-office experience very much.      

The problem I have is with their communication after a visit.  It's difficult to get through when you call.  When you call, the phone is answered by an automated system.  That system will guide you to a nurse's voice mail.  You leave a message, and you wait for a return call.  This process is repeated for any follow-up you may have.  Although calls are returned within 24hrs, the nurse seems hurried when she's on the phone.  I understand that everyone there is busy, but I don't like feeling like I'm just another annoying voice mail that the nurse needs to return.  

This is a great place for an annual exam.  However, since I'm planning to be pregnant in the next year, I know I'll have questions and need to make frequent visits.  I want to feel confident that I can reach a live person if an emergency arises.  Because of that, I'm going some place else.  I'm looking for a smaller office where phones aren't answered by a call center.
