So - I was extremely excited to try this pizza due to the reviews - and here is what I got:

- a guy on the phone who was less than pleasant
- a 50 minute wait for delivery
- a $15 12" pizza

So - while I am not saying that the pizza was bad - I am certainly saying that I will NEVER order from them again.  They do not make their menu available online and when I ordered a large, I expected a large pizza.  The guy on the horn didn't tell me when I placed the order for a 'large pie' that there was only one size.  At best, it's two slices of NY pizza for $15....... in my book, that is a rip off.
