I actually just got back from there. I was starving, so I walked from UCLA down to subway, figuring on some decent, but cheap food. Mistake number one. 

They overtoasted my sub. To the point where it is like eating a crouton. To add injury to insult, the man working put the wrong sauce on my sub. I asked for sweet onion only. And he put something else on, then picked up another bottle. When I said something he promptly replied "no I didn't." The line was out the door, and I was starving. So I went with it. Whatever, right? 

Wrong. I just bit into my sub and found a rather long hair in it. The man MAKING my sub, didn't have long hair. So I'm assuming this was already in the ingredients. 

Venture forth with caution.
