Bad! Worst dining experience!

We had a reservation for my girlfriends birthday party for 15 people. The guest arrived at our reserved time of 7:30 and there were still people at our table. They said we had to wait until they were done eating before we could sit down and did not offer another table. We had to be forcefull to get another table when it was almost 8:00pm. After we had sat down they waited 20 minutes before they even took our drink order.

We asked an employee about speeding up ordering and dinner and he said he would get someone. A waiter walked over and asked us if we needed a table ( even though we literally just stood up from one 10 feet away from him). We told him we asked to speak to a manager and he said "oh just bothering the sushi chef huh? Great" 

We proceeded to walk out. All 15 of us and not one person tried to stop us or ask what was going on. Needless to say I will never go there again.
