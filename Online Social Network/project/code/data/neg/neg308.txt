As my wife says, it's a "restaurant run by MBAs."  They pick a theme based on market research, a location based on market research, a menu based on market research, and then pay employees to put up with customers in exchange for money.  

If I'm wrong in those assumptions, the owners of that place should have tried harder to dispel that feeling.

There is no love at The Asgard.  Frankly, they could have called it J.J. O'Smellyballs' Ye' Olde Taverne and the name would have fit.
