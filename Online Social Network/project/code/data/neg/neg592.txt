I bought a used bike there, in good faith, having done research on local shops. I knew I wanted a used bike, as the new ones were out of my budget. I am not a bicycle novice, but am in no way an expert, either. I wish there would have been knowledgeable sales persons available. I ended up buying a used bike that was a frame size not suited for me, had to get a new seat post installed. I later found out a faulty/old tire was behind 3 flats I had fixed somewhere else, and the rim on the tire itself was not plumb. In talking with other dealers, I found out that these dealers had nothing good to say about the Xchange, and that they had fixed many a bicycle originally purchased there. I also learned there is a blue book for used bikes, and that I had way overpaid. Being sick of putting good money after bad, and having a bike I felt was no longer trustworthy, I got rid of it and found another, better used bike at a dealer who guaranteed to stand behind my purchase, even though it was used. So, buyer beware. I am posting this in hopes of sparing another person the grief I experienced.
