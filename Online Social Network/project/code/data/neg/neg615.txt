Just don't. 

Don't do it. You'll be angry, irritated, and just bitchy your entire rental time. You'll regret the day you walked in their office and signed a lease with them. You really will. 

I've had SO many problems with my current home and the response time to get things fixed is UNBELIEVABLE. Kinsey, one of their office agents, is ridiculous. She will almost ALWAYS put you on hold and go "ask Chuck". You ask a question "uhmm, hold on, lemme go ask Chuck", anything, "lemme go ask Chuck". Can I just talk to Chuck myself since you don't know ANYTHING?

I've had insect problems prior to our move in, prior to signing our lease Kinsey mentioned they'd have our house treated for this. Did it ever happen? Nope. 

Our sink was leaking, called maintenance, he "fixed" it. Few minutes after he left, the disposal fell off and water was dripping into our cabinet. 

AC has been out MULTIPLE times and each time it takes about 2-3 days to get fixed. This is Austin, Texas DURING THE SUMMER. 

Electrical problems. Our electricity would go out in different rooms...ridiculous..rats, leaks, foundation problems, REALTORS WALKING IN OUR HOME WITH FAMILIES WITHOUT CALLING. Really?? HOW are they STILL in business?! I cannot WAIT to get the HELL out of this place and will avoid Metro Realty like the plague. 

Don't ask any of their office staff anything, cause chances are, they'll put you on hold and go "ask Chuck"

You guys disgust me. Worst rental experience...EVER.
