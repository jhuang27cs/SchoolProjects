Make sure you get your credit!!  I didn't get mine, even after going back to the store with a copy of my bank statement 4 times.  Going through all the hassles of making copies of my receipts and submitting them to the manager, there were no credits issued back to my account.  How can that be, you say??  I don't know either!  Even calling their corporate customer service they left me on hold for over 22 minutes.  They forever lost a customer over 42.00 bucks!  Next step... small claims, it 's the principle of the matter. BTW... I've spent nearly 5000 in the last few years.  What ever happened to customer loyalty?
