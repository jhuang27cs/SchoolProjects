Note to self: buy cardstock and make own colored copies. I waited almost ten minutes to get ten copies. Granted the machine wasn't behaving, but I wasn't only person getting frustrated at the lack of service. At most places, there are more than one heavy duty copiers, but not this place. I was almost tempted to have them give me a stack of cardstock so I could use the self-service colored copiers; however, that is what I get for thinking. I don't think I will be coming back here because I have had better experiences else where.
