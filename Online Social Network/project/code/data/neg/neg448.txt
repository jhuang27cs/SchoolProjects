When I started at Berkeley, this place was $0.99 per item, and during my student tenure here, it was raised first to $1, then to $1.10, and then to $1.25 per item.  I'm sure it's hovering around $1.50/item here now.  It was known as "the cheap dollar chinese place."

This place is DISGUSTING.  Seriously.  When I was living in the Unit 3 dorms across the street, this was the closest place to get something quick and cheap.  I kid you not, though, one time I was going home for Thanksgiving and was busy packing, so I didn't have enough time to eat.  I picked up some GREASY chinese food here, and it literally made me ill.  I threw up twice - once in the dorms, and once on the plane ride home, and it actually ruined my Thanksgiving dinner.

Oh, how I hate you.  You kept me from my mother's sweet honey roasted ham, you devil restaurant you.
