I read the reviews for Wolfe burgers here and saw the stars so I thought this had to be the place. I'm sorry people. I had a 1/3 lb with swiss cheese. It sure was a thin burger. Not at all like the burger from Fuddruckers. And it was dry. Very dry. The only moisture dripping from the burger were a few drops from the tomato slice. The 1/6 pound burger with cheese also sucked. 

2 stars because the onion rings and fries were ok. Tops makes a tastier burger. Better yet, for the same price as Wolfe you could go to Damon's in Glendale and have a real burger.
