I guess it's not bad for what they do - which isn't much. 

The basic interior/exterior wash is 15.99 here. I thought they would do a better job if I got the more expensive one for 26.99 so I got that but no it was all the same quick, crappy work that they were doing to everyone's car. They're all about getting your car cleaned quickly here, which is fine if you want an overall clean look, but if you look closely at any part of your car you'll realize it's really still got a layer of grime left. Now I know the 'quality' level of their work so I'll come here with lower expectations next time. I.e. if I just want a general quick wash and vacuum and then I'll just detail the interior/exterior myself. Ultimately I'll do a better job than anything they could probably do even if I did pay for them to detail it.
