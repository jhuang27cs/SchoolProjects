I walked into the store with the intention of purchasing 3 pairs of shoes: salsa, swing, and dance sneakers. I figured I'd spend a couple hundred dollars and was OK with that. By the time I walked out, I didn't want to give them 1 cent.

To say that the sales girls at this store are the laziest people I've ever seen is an understatement. They sat there on their behinds taking personal calls, chatting with each other, annoyed if you were trying on shoes in "their way" and even more annoyed if you *gasp* wanted to try on a different size. At one point I just tried on the display so I wouldn't have to ask for another size. When it seemed to fit, I asked if I could try on the mate to it. The girl looked extremely annoyed and said "So do you want me to get the other one?" Big sigh from her. Yes, indeed I did. Perhaps I should have asked her to point me to the stock room as it would have been much easier and more pleasant for me to get it myself. When I asked them for a different size they said they didn't have it; when the owner walked by and asked how I was doing & I indicated fine but the shoes were too big, he magically found smaller sizes. These girls should be fired. They are not only to worth what they are getting paid, they are driving business away.

Although the owner of the store ran around like a madman trying to get sizes, styles, etc. he is also the person in charge of his staff.  I have never felt so unwelcome in a store; I have never experienced salespeople who have less desire to have you purchase from them. It was as if I was infringing on their personal space and time. 

I really want to shop locally but I won't go there anymore. Almost all of what you can get there, you can get on the internet. Terrible.
