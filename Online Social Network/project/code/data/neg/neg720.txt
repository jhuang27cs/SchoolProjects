I'd say this place is in line with Friday's or Chilis. Went here for dinner on Saturday night with 5 friends, and I think i've been here for drinks but this time i had dinner. we got a few pitchers of Helles beer which was pretty good i must say. at $15 each, one pitcher yields 4 (16oz) pints. so it might make sense to get imperial (20oz) pints individually, as we originally anticipated a pitcher yielding 5 pints. Sarah and Neil recommended getting these asian crispadillas which were ok, but nothing to write home about for me. I ordered the smoke house burger which was a burger with smoked gouda, bacon, and LTO, it came with steak fries seasoned with old bay. As far as burgers go, this was edible. Neil also got  burger, sarah got mac n cheese, Dan got a buffalo chicken sandwich that looked great, Jen got the corned beef sandwich special which also looked pretty good, and Vik got the buffalo chicken mac n cheese, in which there was minimal buffalo sauce. the place is huge and is probably good for groups but the food is just run-of-the-mill. There's def better food in cambridge (i hope), but if you're looking for a dinner centered around drinking then i guess this establishment is ok.
