The last time I came here, they took forever to get my order to me, and the waitress was dismissive whenever I asked when I would get my food.  The hostess was kinder to me about finding out where my food was and another worker (not sure what he was... worked in the back, dish washer?) even refilled my tea for me.  The waitress was not doing her job.  On top of that, the fish was disgusting.  It tasted like fridge.  I guess I had forgotten what I wrote in my previous review.  But if you call yourself a sushi place... I should be able to order sushi that is edible.  I would never come back here.
