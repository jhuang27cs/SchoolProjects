Crappy service. The pizza was good but the level of service on a Friday during the day was bad.  We wanted to have some beer and pizza but basically had one beer while waiting for our pizza since no servers came around to ask for drinks and the bartender only was behind the bar for about 5 minutes to get our initial order.  We got better service and hospitality from Hole in the Wall.
