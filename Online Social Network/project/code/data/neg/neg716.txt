Last night's fixed price menu ($39) included one of the worst cioppino bowls I've ever had. The sea food was so over cooked, to the point of dry chewy toughness. The sauce a bland red zero. The side of caramelized carrots were not caramelized and were raw in the center. The chocolate cheesecake was neither chocolaty enough nor cheesy enough. 

The green salad was very good. Others liked their osso bucco and petrale sole.

Attention to detail was lacking. Scales found on my fish. A dry splodge on my wine glass, and the rim was chipped.

At a total price of $75 each we expected so much more. We won't go back.
