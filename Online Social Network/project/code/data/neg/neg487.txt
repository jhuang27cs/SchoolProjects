Stopped in for a what I thought would be a quick lunch on Saturday, in hopes of a decent meal, since I'd heard good things about Tory Row. WRONG! 

The selling points of the restaurant are certainly the decor and the beer list, which both veer on the side of urban hipster, but not annoyingly so. 

I sat down after I couldn't find a host, only to get scowled at by at surly waiter who threw the menu on the table while notifying that I should have waited to be seated. No one else in the restaurant was seated by a waiter or a host while I was there and trust me, it was quite a while...He asked for my drink order which never arrived because he promptly sat down to eat HIS lunch, in the table next to me, after taking my order.

Finally, when another waitress realized that I wasn't being served, she took my order for both the drink and my croque monsieur. Water didn't get to me until 10 minutes later, followed by the croque monsieur 20 minutes after the water. By the time I got the sandwich, I had been in the restaurant for well over 45 minutes, at lunchtime. 

The croque monsieur was burnt, both the cheese and the bread. The bread actually couldn't even be called bread anymore, since it was a pile of ashes. I sent it back, only to have the same order to be sent back to me with the comment "that's how we serve it." 

Unsurprisingly, the check once again took another 10 minutes to get, and another 10 to get my change. 

Tory Row is certainly pretty but their staff, in the kitchen and on the floor need changing, pronto.
