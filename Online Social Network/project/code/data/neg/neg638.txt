I've only gone to Princeton Medical Group once, but my experience with Dr. Ginger Hua was enough to make me not want to go back.

I scheduled a same day appointment because I had had hives for days and they were worsening.  Dr. Hua quickly examined my hives from across the examination room and prescribed a cream.  Easy enough, but my questions (what can I use to supplement this cream if symptoms persist and how long until I experience relief) were met with irritation.  I was told that this cream should quell all itching with a condescending tone and also that I would have immediate relief.  She then added that I should call her back if they had not gone away in one week's time.

The next morning, when the itching was still in full force and I had no relief, I left a message for Dr. Hua.  Her assistant phoned me later that day to say that it's only been 12 hours, and I should allow at least 24 to see if the cream is working.  It's unfortunate that this wasn't explained during my visit, and I was allowed to leave the office with seemingly unrealistic expectations of "instant relief" and "no more itching."

Fast forward to one week later.  My hives are nearly gone, but so is my prescription.  I left a message for Dr. Hua detailing this, adding that I was about to leave for vacation, and the response I received from her assistant hours later was that I should call a dermatologist.  Again, why was I not given these instructions during my visit?  Why was I instead told to contact Dr. Hua?

The bottom line is that I didn't feel I was the only patient in the room during my visit with Dr. Hua (even though I literally was) and her flippant attitude towards my discomfort AND MY QUESTIONS was something that I've never experienced before with a family doctor and I can only hope never will again.

There could very well be amazing doctors at this facility, but I will never know.
