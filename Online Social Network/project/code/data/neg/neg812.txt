I hate to say the words "always" and "never", or any similarly extreme ones when talking about service, but I can honestly say that the 4 or 5 times I have had new scripts faxed in from my doctor, I have called to check and been told they hadn't received them yet. Today, an hour and a half had passed, and the girl was going to hang up after saying it wasn't in, before I asked her to check their faxes. 5 minutes on hold later, she comes back and says they are in and will be ready in an hour.

I've never had trouble with the friendliness of clerks or pharmacists, and understand things can get crazy (I have family who were pharmacy techs for CVS years ago) but this is just bad customer service. When someone is sick, and needs medicine, the last thing they want to do is wait around for someone to "eventually" check the incoming prescriptions to see if perhaps any have come in. I believe strongly in being fair to people who work in customer service, but there is a requirement of being thoughtful of a customer's needs as well.
