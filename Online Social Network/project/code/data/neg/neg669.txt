I really love Mexican food, and hoped this place would be awesome. But it isn't--it's not horrible either. It's just that the fish taco was undercooked, and without any crunch. Also, the guacamole, while it was fine, was not anything to brag about and it cost 8 dollars. At least, at Mama Mexico, the guacamole is worth the price.  Also, Cascabel does not give you very many chips to go with your expensive guacamole. 

In my opinion, the margaritas (and we only had one each) were exceptionally good, but very expensive. $10? Not strong enough for that price, although I still recommend them.

Anyway, I hoped Cascabel would be better than Chipotle or Taqueria Y Fonda, but it isn't.
