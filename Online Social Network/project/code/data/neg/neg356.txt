I know this sounds harsh, but hear me out.

The food here is.. not bad. Not the most authentic thing in the world, but its tasty and decent. The service, however, was a nightmare.

I get there and I am told that I cannot be seated until my friend gets here. OK, I wait on the sidelines and finally get my table when my friend arrives. The server then gets our orders and very surprisingly comes back with the food 2 seconds after. Whoa - its impossible that they cooked it from scratch after we order it.  But- then again, its fast and efficient and i'm happy.

Everything is still fine, but then two servers that are passing each other NEXT to our table (a male and female) stop what they are doing. The female server is now SPANKING the male server and then bending down to look at his butt...

They weren't even doing this over the counter, it was in the seating area itself- and we stopped to look over and wonder WTF just happened. 

Later, another server drops a knife on the floor and leaves it there, and when we finally get our check, it takes our server about 20mins to pick up our credit cards. I had to waive at her to come forward because we really needed to leave.

So, like I said.. not trying to be mean or anything, but regardless of how good the food is - server spanking really does not add value to my meal. Get a room you too!
