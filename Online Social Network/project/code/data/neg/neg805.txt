So it is nice to see a little variety at the UCSD Food Court(s).
I saw the initial 5 Star reviews and was actually excited, so today I made the trek across campus to visit the new Price Center and find out about this Bombay Coast place.

I was disappointed, and yet not.

My disappointment came from the hopes generated from previous reviews, but in truth the fare was what I had expected.  

The food was better than the usual fast food junk found in food courts, but the Sag Paneer was greasey, and the Chicken Korma was bland.  The Naan was alright.

I did not venture into trying the Chai (I am picky about Chai), 

The foodcourt Indian at Sitar is MUCH better, and not too far from campus.
