Union Station Brewery is just ok - which is a let down by itself.

I'm generally a *big* fan of the local microbrew. I'll cut an establishment a lot of slack because of originality and self sufficiency; every sip of beer at Union Station just had me saying, "meh"

The food was average. Standard pub food. The dark atmosphere was both different and reminded me of drinking/eating in someone's basement. 

Service kept the theme going.....more indifference.

Better options available in the immediate area.
