*Avoid this place*

They are so rude and the vibe is negative. They really do not appreciate the business or the fact that we have choices and chose them. Felt rushed and unappreciated. In todays economy the fact that anyone is spending 15 bucks for a 2 year olds haircut is a blessing and any business that has good customers should feel blessed, therefore appreciate the patronage.
