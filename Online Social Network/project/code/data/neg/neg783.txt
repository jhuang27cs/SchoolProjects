Today was a nice pleasant day to walk around Berkeley and grab a hot dog for a quick bite.  But after I placed my order for a top dog, the disinterested and clearly bored female cook/cashier/cleaner/whatever placed my dog to the hot side of the grill, took my cash and gave me change.  Then she came out from behind the counter to wipe up the wet puddled sticky dirty floor below the clogged, overflowing soda machine basin.  She wiped dry the floors with paper towels then wiped off spilled ketchup, mustard and other mess on the counters.  I thought this was great that she cares to clean up after messy customers.  But then she went back behind the counter and emptied hot dog bread rolls to toast on the grill.  OMG...she didn't WASH her bare hands after taking my order, making change, wiping dry the pooled floors and dirty counters.  Then she starts touching bread, utensils to serve dogs, soda cups, potato salad and the paper wrapping my top dog!!!  G-R-O-S-S to the MAX!!!  

I couldn't believe this health code violation happening right before my eyes.  I was speechless when she handed over my top dog.  I just took the top dog, walked out to the sidewalk and tossed it into the garbage bin.  I hope the homeless didn't bite into that trashed dog and get sick.  Sorry but I warned you here.  Try the other Top Dog locations, maybe the workers wash their hands over there before serving your food.
