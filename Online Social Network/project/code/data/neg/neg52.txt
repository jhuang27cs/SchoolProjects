The food here was just ok. I had chicken karathi, which was FULL of bones. There was barely any meat, just bones, and I ended up taking all the chicken out and eating it vegetarian-style. We got it delivered and they forgot our samosas, and then the guy went to the wrong address to deliver them to us. The prices were cheap, but I'll definitely try somewhere else before I try this place again.
