this is new place with nice decor. lots of Asian students there and they are terribly loud. if u must eat there ask for a table away from them. i also noticed that food is served to Asians in different way. i ordered fried rice. menu said it had pineapple. so dish came in real pineapple but pineapple pieces in a rice was absolutely made out if canned pineapple. pineapple shell they used looked like it was reused. i also noticed that Asians were getting the same rice on a plate without dirty pineapple shape and twice the portion. basically food is nothing to write home about, tiny portions, brown rice surcharge is $5. and waiter clearly don't treat non Asian customers the same as they treat their own. stay away.
