While this might be a very good place for lunch or coffee drinks, it is NOT a good breakfast spot. Other than pastries the only breakfast offering is a ham & cheese croissant. The croissant I had was light and flaky, but the ham was the cheapest kind of water-logged, too-salty, grocery-store, rectangular, pressed ham that I would not buy myself and would certainly not expect to be served in a restaurant. What saved the sandwich was melted cheese  and crisp lettuce and tomato.  I probably won't go back.
