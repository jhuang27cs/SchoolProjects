The epitome of sucktitude lies here.  There is no reason to go to Denny's unless you are A) piss drunk or B) devoid of taste buds and emotion.  It's amazing how every Denny's('s) wait staff is equally atrocious.  I don't know where they train these people but caring about the customer clearly was not a point of emphasis.  Food is terrible, service is worse, and Jack in the Box is just down the road.
