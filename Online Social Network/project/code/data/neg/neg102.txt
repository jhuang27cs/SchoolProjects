We showed up a few minutes before ten which is great because we avoided paying a cover.  We walked in and I was one of maybe four or five males in the whole place.  Apparently this is where women go for a girls night out.  It was a Saturday so maybe the alleged 80s nights draws them in.

Whatever the case they were soon clearing away tables and chairs.  The lighting changes and it becomes a dance club venue...sort of.  The walls and bar appear to be left overs from a more traditional pub.  The DJ seems to be doing a lot up there with headphones and switches but generally the music just cuts from song to song with no transition and certainly no rhyme or reason.  I've been to parties where people setup a playlist on their computer to play for four hours and it was 10x better than the random mix of songs (often not even danceable songs) that were played.

When we left around eleven thirty I was amazed there was a very long line outside.  I can only assume the location makes this place more appealing.  I certainly wouldn't go looking for this place.
