After I finished my last final exam, I had a hankering for sushi.. I always walk by Crave and I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the sashimi sampler (or something like that). Oh my god this stuff was nasty. The fish was mushy. And a little warm. Simply disgusting. I only had a few pieces before I decided it might be unsafe to eat any more (not because of health reasons so much as a fear of forever hating sushi). I have no idea how the non-sushi stuff is. It all looks pretty generic. I would rather go a couple of block down the street and eat at Thai Kitchen.
