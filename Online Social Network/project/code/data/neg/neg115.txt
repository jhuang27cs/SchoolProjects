this is the worst coffee shop i have ever been to! you should be ashamed to call yourself peet's. i have never been so insulted in my life by the woman that works here as well as that stupid manager! they need to learn how to treat customers with repsect! there needs to be a starbucks on campus so we can get decent service and coffee!
