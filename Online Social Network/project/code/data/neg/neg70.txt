Food is overpriced and mediocre at best. The service is atrocious and the staff was very rude! I ordered a steak medium rare and was served a piece of meat so well done that even my dog would think twice about eating it. When I asked to have it sent back I was given an attitude by my server and it took almost 45 minutes for a new one, which was now rare.  I am not sure where the kitchen staff learned how to cook but I have seen better steaks at Ponderosa. In the end I settled for a bowl of chowder because after being there for almost 2 hours at this point I just wanted to be fed. Don't eat here you will regret it. I use Yelp all the time but have never posted until now. My experience was so bad that I couldn't keep this one to myself.
