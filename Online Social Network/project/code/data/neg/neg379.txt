Not good.  We had a couple soups and shared a main dish.  Everything was overly done - as if a "thai sauce" jar was opened and applied to everything.  The service was pleasant however.   It would have been better if the cook wasn't staring at us through the kitchen pickup window and we didn't find a bug in our soup - I actually had to remind the waiter to remove the charge after it was on the bill!
