The food was not good but not quite bad.. just edible. We ordered the cheese and meat platter to start and it was not what I was expecting to say the least. The platter arrives and it looked like something out of the deli section at Key Food (no offense to Key Food). It tasted worse than it looked. Then the pizza arrived and that was okay but too much sauce considering how thin the pizza was. The drinks were okay for the most part. The waiter ended up messing up on our bill and instead of being nice about it he had an attitude and implied that it was our fault. Needless to say this is not a place I would return to or recommend to anyone based on my experience.
