My husband and I ate here for the first and last time.  The food was mediocre, and soon after leaving the diner we were both sick with stomach illness.  If you're looking for diner food, the Silver Dinner in Greenbelt is a better option.  If you're looking for Greek food you have two options: the New Deal Cafe in Old Greenbelt (which recently became mostly Greek) and Marathon Deli (4429 Lehigh Rd, College Park).
