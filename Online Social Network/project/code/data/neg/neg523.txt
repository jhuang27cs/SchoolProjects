I couldn't agree with Courtney P. more. Instead or ordering an Omelet here ask for a stick of butter. It will taste the same!

If you do decide to go I would only indulge in crepes. The Oakland location is overrun with Pitt freshman....for a better Pamela's experience hit up the one in Shadyside. And on Sunday get there before 11 or you will never be seated!
