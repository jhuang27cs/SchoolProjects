The business model of the Black Sheep seems to be: "We are the only hip bakery in Amherst so you will eat our cookies and enjoy it no matter how little we try." 

Staff are nice. Ambiance is fine. Cute sandwich names. The Black Sheep seems great on paper, but in practice it often disappoints. The baked goods and desserts are just not very good. Cookies are dry. Cakes are too dense. Consistently disappointing food in general.

It's really not surprising that Black Sheep has been having some financial stumbles. I don't believe that locals really support it often.
