I think this was the first restaurant I went to in downtown when I moved to AA.  I was frankly a little disappointed because the food was mediocre and expensive.  The food tastes too American . . . ?  Dishes that I normally enjoy and consider favorites were just a little too sweet or salty. It wasn't terrible, but something about them just didn't taste right.

I wouldn't really recommend this for Indian food, unless you were looking for a nicer, "American" atmosphere and don't mind the altered flavors of the food.  I suggest Mahek or Madras Masala instead.
