Never tried the food, but I was very disappointed by the customer service and ethics of this company. I purchased a Living Social voucher for $200 worth of catering and the terms said "service area includes 40-mile radius of DC; travel fees may apply for greater distances". Nowhere did it say that local delivery was not included or was additional. I had several conversations with the manager about my event and then learned at the last minute that they wanted me to pay a very high delivery fee. I tried to negotiate but the company would not budge. It was a classic "bait and switch" tactic that only a rip-off company would use. I canceled my order and living social refunded my purchase price, but I was left scrambling at the last minute.
