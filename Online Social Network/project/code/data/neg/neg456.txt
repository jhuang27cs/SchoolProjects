okay i'll admit the decor is nice and it is way more upscale than any other club in slo. but w.t.f!?

i went there on a saturday night and there were hella old people everywhere! there was a grandpa sitting at the bar! everyone i looked at had wrinkles! 

even though other people have told me it's not that bad, i will never go there again.
