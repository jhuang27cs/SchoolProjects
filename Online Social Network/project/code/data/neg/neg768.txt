If you are looking for any type of Asian food, you are not going to find it here.  What you are going to find is slightly overpriced mediocre food next to CMU which makes it popular for no particular reason. 

I have tried the pho (really sad) and the rice with duck which was decent, but was not butchered well.  

Overall if you need something in the CMU area you can do a lot better and the service could use improvement as well.
