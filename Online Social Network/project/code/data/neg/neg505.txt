It makes me oddly happy that two of the three reviews for this Best Buy echo the true terribleness of this Best Buy.  My first thought on walking into this location was, "my God, this place is laid out HORRIBLY."  That's the least of it.  It looks sort of like it was once a grocery store, remade as a Best Buy, that's how incongruous the whole affair is.  Couldn't find anything, couldn't find help, lines were way too long.  Overall -- atrocious.
