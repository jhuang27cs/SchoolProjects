This place was totally underwhelming.  The "air fries" tasted exactly like frozen fries out of a bag that your mom baked in the oven.  My Thai Chicken wrap was OK but I wouldn't want another one unless you bought it for me.  The vanilla shake tasted like milk mixed with crushed ice.   I'm sure it was healthy enough but frankly fat gram for fat gram I'd rather have a plain dog and 1 onion ring at the Varsity than Thai Chicken Wrap and Air Fries.
