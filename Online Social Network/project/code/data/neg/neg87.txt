They are evil evil evil since I know I'll keep coming back regardless of the sky-high prices, the rubbery/bland food and coffee that should be ashamed to call itself that. Why? It's in a primo location which is probably the only reason they stay in business and the tables are good for study sessions. And the service isn't bad. 

They've played CD's on repeat which can make one never forget their headphones again.

Smoothies are possibly worse than the coffee as they have no resemblance to real fruit and taste like (bad) pureed Yoplait with ice. 

Even their damned ice teas are pricey and they only have one flavor. *runs to Zoka's*

And chai lattes are one of my favorite drinks in the world which happened to taste nothing like chai ... or much milk. Just a vague watery concoction of nutmeg. Blegh.
