i hang out in harvard square quite a bit, so redline is a convenient place to dance when i'm too lazy to trek far.  it's fairly typical for the area: lots of harvard students and area professionals donning untucked work attire and/or professionally torn jeans from the local amberzombie.

if you're bored and in the area, check it out.  otherwise head to noir for a better time.
