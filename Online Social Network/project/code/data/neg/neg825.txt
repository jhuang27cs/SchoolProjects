What started as a lunch full of promise ended in a complete disaster. It's a shame, too, because I really wanted to like this custom-built truck with its four pit grills and fresh paint and decor. The Indian guy who greeted me seemed nice enough, too. Unfortunately, the pulled pork wasn't ready yet, so I asked for a pork rib sandwich on the condition that there were no bones in it. He assured me that the bones were removed from the meat. The bun is so soft and fresh and the sauce is so tasty that I decided to take my first chomp. Crunch... oh, no... bones! I could see them. I pulled the rib pieces out of the sandwich and bit off what meat was on each piece. Quite honestly, the pork was very well-prepared, but to put this in a sandwich? I'm used to rib places calling bone-in ribs with a side of bread a sandwich, but they typically give you big, long ribs, not cross-cut ribs like the ones used in Korean BBQ. I'm utterly disappointed with the rib sandwich. I should've waited for the pulled pork sandwich, but my gut told me to give the rib sandwich a try. I'll return again to try the pulled pork, but not for a while. There are too many other good options available in the area.
