Food is okay. I've had better Japanese food. It's not as expensive as Joshuya's but the food quality is quite distinguishable, unfortunately.

But why am I complaining...they're supposed to be open till 10pm. 

10 P.M. my butt.

Not tooooo upset because at least it means they're treating their workers well (not working them overtime), but from a customer's perspective, not too cool. My friend and I practically ran here from the BART so we can make it on time (got there at 9:30) but they refused to serve us because it was too close to closing. Boo.
