Ok, I had two consecutive bad experience that went from bad to horrible. I went with my husband one night, 8/30/09 to be exact,  to try out the restaurant.  It was generally pleasant, food was good and reasonable.  However the wait staff is not well attentive at all and the food was very slow coming out of the kitchen.  This being a Sunday night and the restaurant was at most 50% full, led me to wonder how well the restaurant is managed.  And to be fair, the food was decent.

The following Monday, 8/31/09, I went back with my family hoping for a better experience since this restaurant was Zagat rated.  The waiter brought out a house salad.  Upon finishing the salad,  I discovered a ladybug in the bottom of the  bowl.  Shocked and disgusted, I showed the waiter and his reaction was "Did it just fly in?"  I could not believe the stupidity of the waiter.  The restaurant was an enclosed space, no outside seating, how can a ladybug possibly fall from the ceiling?! The waiter then showed the bowl to the head waiter and I saw him going inside the kitchen.  But upon returning to the dinning room, the head waiter and the original waiter acted like nothing had happened! Completely ignored us. I  was outraged by this point and I asked for the waiter to come and asked him, so what's going on? The waiter mumbled something to the effect that "oh, we were just going to take it off your check.  Would you like another salad?"

By this point  my family and I  couldn't stand it any longer and could not bare dealing with this type of nonsense and left the restaurant.

"Complete idiots"  and "horrific experience" was the best comment I  could say about this place.

These are my true personal experience, NOT  hearsay as some people might assume.
