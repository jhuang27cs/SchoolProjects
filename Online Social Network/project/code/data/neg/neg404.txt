Free samples. Great tea.

Worse customer service ever!!!!!!!
I am beyond livid at the attitude and the SHEER STUPIDITY of the workers at this establishment.

"Can I buy a cup of that tea I just sampled"
"ok"
"so um yea can i buy it.."
"ok" *staring at me like a dear caught in headlight"

GAH! so move on to another worker.

"Can i buy a cup of that tea I just sampled"
"It's going to b $5.40" --  with so much attitude and looking at me like I can't afford it!

Next time, I'll stick to drinking the free samples till I've quenched my thirst and just order tea online.
