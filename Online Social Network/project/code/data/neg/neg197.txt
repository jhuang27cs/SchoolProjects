When I first started going to UCLA, this is one of the first restaurants I ever went to and I must say, I am glad I tried other places. I tried their beef noodles, and the Noodle Planet Pho which is a thai-influenced pho that is sour and has pepper flakes. The beef noodles were oddly sweet, I am used a mild sweetness balanced with the beefy savoriness in Thai beef noodles, but this was sweeter than a typical bowl of noodles should have been. The Noodle Planet Pho was an interesting take on pho, but it was soo full of msg I had to drink three glasses of water from being so thirsty. The place is cheap so I understand why people come here and they are open pretty late. Perfect for us college kids, but the food is lacking.
