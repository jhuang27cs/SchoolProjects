The pizza here is really your fast food type.  The cheese is bland and tasteless, meaning you will be loading up on salt, pepper, garlic, and/or red pepper.  We call this place heartburn pizza.  The sauce is ok, but too thin.  The crust isn't bad, not thick or thin.

The sandwiches are surprisingly good though.  Chicken parm and meatball both have a good taste and are hearty.  The salads aren't great, but what can you do, there are plenty of other options.
