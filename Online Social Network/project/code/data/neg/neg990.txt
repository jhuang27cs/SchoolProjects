I was so excited to see this new food truck on UH campus and I really wanted to like these guys! Maybe it was a one time thing? This review is only for the 3 Cheese Curry Beef Burger.

Presentation (A): Everything looked appealing and fresh.

Service (B): After ordering, it took around 15 minutes for the food to be ready. There was a line of people so for fresh food, it wasn't too bad. They even have a fancy shmancy tv that you can watch while you wait for your order and there's also music playing.

Food and Execution (C): The initial bite into the burger was yum and that curry flavor was definitely on point but after that it went downhill.  The bread was burnt on the inside and so was the crispiness layer of ?? bacon?. Each bite was burnt flavor overpowering the curry flavor. Thankfully the meat and $1 extra egg wasn't. The meat however was lacking that juiciness flavor. If you like the lean, no natural oozing oil in the meat then I guess you might like this burger. I suspect this was all due to smushing the meat to cook faster. 

Another plus was that I wasn't charged $1 extra for using a credit card. I don't know if this is due to the venue being at UH? But I'm glad, because I like tiping if there's no credit card charge! 

Anyways, pretty disappointed :( but I'm still determined to try something else on their menu and not kurb these guys off the street!
