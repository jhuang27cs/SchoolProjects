Nothing about this place stands out. It's got a nice outdoor seating area, and you can get a coffee and sandwich for relatively cheap (all things considered -- you ARE in Hahvahd) but looking back on this place, nothing really grabs you.  Another nail in the coffin of the blandification of Harvard Square.
