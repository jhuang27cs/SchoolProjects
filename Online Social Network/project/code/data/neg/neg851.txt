This place was recommended to me by a REALLY good friend of mine... but she did recommend specific people whom were not working the day I went in. 

I went last Thursday evening after being in Mexico for nearly 2 weeks and my back had been KILLING me, Thomas Jefferson sleeps at odd angles which translates to sometime sleeping in awkward back or leg positioning so hence I wanted a massage.

I called and was able to get a same day appointment - was NOT IMPRESSED at all =/ and for $85.00 I expect better. The room was freezing the massage table is heated but the room was COLD, I was in a room with 2 beds and the one they gave me I was angled right where the door opened... it was a bit strange layout.

Here is the thing about massages and I KNOW MASSAGES! you have to have enough oil when you are rubbing on someone skin it becomes a RUG BURN if you don't have enough flippin oil on your hands. I couldn't relax I was so dayum cold and I didn't want to say "Hey Lady put some more lotion on your hands" LOL for some reason that sounds... lewd and sexual said from my laying down position LMAO!!!

This Spa is inside the Claremont Club and I think if I were to go again (I'm doubting it) I would ask for Amanda or Carly those are the people I hear that do a Outstanding job.
