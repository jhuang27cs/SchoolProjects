My friend got a nautical star tattoo from this place.   well.. it's horrible

SImple, right? The lines were very crooked and the shading was really bad and uneven.  Granted, this shop could be really good and my friend got the one bad artist... but just be aware that there is a chance you may get that one bad tattoo artist.
