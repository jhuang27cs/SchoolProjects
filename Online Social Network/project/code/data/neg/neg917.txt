Not to sound like Seinfeld, but what's with the nonsensical names of various Ann Arbor businesses? "Sushi.come"? "No Thai"? "Dogma-Catmantoo"? "Coney Island"?

Anyhoo. Now that we have a baby in the house, we run out of things to eat for dinner at least once a week, so we've been exploring the world of Take Out in Ann Arbor.  No Thai is completely (And luckily) forgettable - I had some sort of basil-based item that had too much sicky-sweet sauce, green peppers (gross) and deflated juicy bits of fried tofu - yawn. I will add a star because I requested #2 spicy (on a scale of 1-8), and it was actually decently spicy. 

The Mister had some sort of noodles that he described as a combo of curry and pad thai, which sounds disgusting, but he liked it. I didn't get a chance to try it because we eat in shifts now. Let that be a lesson to you young whipper-snappers out there - you will no longer be able to sample your spouse's take-out when you have kids.
