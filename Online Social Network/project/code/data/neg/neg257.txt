This place is awful!  Granted, some of the blame goes to my equally bad eye insurance...but still....The people are rude and NOT AT ALL helpful.  In fact, every time I go in there, I feel like they're trying to fleece me.  First, they said everything was included in the exam and proceeded to give me the "extensive" exam...which means that everything is NOT included in the exam and I got hit with a bill at the end.  Then my prescription has expired (by about 2 months) so they won't fill my contact prescription unless I get a new exam (not covered by my insurance) for $145!!!  Their lenses also cost more than many other places.  Do yourself a favor-- go somewhere else.
