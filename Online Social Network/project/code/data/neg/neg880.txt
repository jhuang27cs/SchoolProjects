It gets two stars because it's open 24 hours to people in cars and I think closes at 10pm for walk-in/dine-in customers. I know this location would have more issues if it kept it's dining room open 24 hours. The parking lot is a known drug spot. I realized this the very first time I walked by it. People just ask if "you need anything" when walking by. Lots of Pitbull owners hang with their dogs between here and the liquor store next door and the bus stop. I have many stories involving the customers here.

Crackheads, junkies, homeless, ex-cons, gang-bangers, dealers, hookers, lawyers, cops, security guards, out of town church groups, UW students, athletes & staff, drunks, psychos, pets and animals, retired daily regulars and people from all over the world can regularly be seen at this location. Depending on when you go, you might be more likely to see an abundance of the negative but it is a never-closing restaurant on the north end of the Ave in Seattle's U-District.

Go at your own risk. Eating in may be very entertaining but I've seen some bad stuff go down in this place, and I'm not easily phased. This place ain't a bank, those cameras are there for a reason, not standard procedure. The place has a machine to take orders. It might be cheaper, quicker, more accurate than a human but I truly believe it would be hard to find a human (the world over) who would want to and could accurately cashier at this location dealing with the issues of the unwashed masses. Some people forget this is Jack-in-the-Crack and not a 5-star restaurant downtown.
