Without a doubt, this is the worst place I've eaten at in Berkeley. It's been a while since I've visited Indian Flavors Express, so I can't recall exactly what I ordered on the menu, but I do know this:
- the portions are tiny
- everything you order is in a puddle of oil
- they don't know the first thing about spicy as nothing is actually spicy
- spicy to these people actually means extremely sour
- the amount of rice you get is enough to feed a small bird. 
- the price is about $6-$9 for the dishes and then $1 or $2 for the nann or rice.
- this place is empty most of the time. i should've taken this as a clue of how terrible this place is
- to the reviewer who said you walk in and are greeted with the smell of *hand ground* spices... how in the world do you get this? if anything, there's a reek of vomit from the place

I would highly not recommend going here. i ended up eating 1/4 of my order, and then getting some la burrita after.
