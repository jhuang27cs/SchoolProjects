The staff couldn't be friendlier... and the prices are GREAT.  I wish I could say the same for the instructor, the pace, and the studio.   The instructor, bless her heart, moves a bit slower than your average Zumba instructor and isn't the most coordinated teacher.  The studio space is teeny tiny.  There were about 20 people in the class in a space that should accomodate 12, maybe even 15.  It was the slowest paced Zumba class I've ever encountered - so if you're looking for that, this is the class for you.  If you're looking for a high energy, hip-hop type of Zumba class, look elsewhere.
