Well, first off, I'm not a fan of McDonald's... was once upon a time, but hadn't had it for years, moved to Pasadena and copped some on my way home from class... couldn't finish it, the meat tasted awful, maybe it was just that one, but there are better things around. I come here for the fries, they aren't as good as when they fried em in meat, but still great with a shake. This location, however, turns off their shake machine before they actually close... so... I'm not happy about that... but I like the building design.
