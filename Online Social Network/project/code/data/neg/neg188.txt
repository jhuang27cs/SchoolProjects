Drink & food: Typical and overpriced. I ordered mint coffee and baklava as my Sunday afternoon treat. The coffee arrived with lots of whipped cream on top with mint syrup. The coffee itself tasted alright, nothing amazing... the whipped cream was a bit unnecessary and mint syrup was eh... lame. The baklava was meh as well... not as moist as I wanted it to be. The bill came out to be $10-- definitely not reasonable.

Service: You walk in the store... the waitresses ask you, "How many?" You tell them. They tell you, "Great, grab and menu and sit anywhere you want." It's not your typical coffee house where you order, grab your drink, and sit. It's more like a restaurant setup. Anyway, my waitress was great, so no complaints there. 

It's a 2 star mainly, b/c of how typical everything tasted and yet it was super expensive. Plus, there's no wi-fi, so don't bother bringing your laptop to browse the internet... perhaps, a book or reading for class would do, but definitely no internet. =/
