If my review deters at least one person from going to this horrendous restaurant, I'll be happy.  The owner is absolutely insane. He cursed out a family for not having their entire party present and banished them from the restaurant like some kind of crazy tyrant. There were several children in the restaurant, but that did not stop him from using the F word repeatedly. He created such a scene - so awful, so unwarranted - that everyone in there felt uncomfortable.  He ruined the night for all of us. How is this place still in business? ESPECIALLY since the food is mediocre at best. I'd give this place 0 stars if I could.
