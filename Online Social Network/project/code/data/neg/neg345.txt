Beware -- The parking lot for this business now has a person on the lot hiding in a car who boots your car as soon as you leave the property, even if you are only going off the property for 2 minutes after having lunch.  I have gone to this business for years but will not ever again.  This deceptive practice and holding you up for $75 is terrible
