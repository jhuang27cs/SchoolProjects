The most ridiculously overpriced dining experience I have ever had.  When I pay as much as I paid at the The Melting Pot, I expect professional chefs to prepare my food using ingredients and methods that I could not easily copy at home.  Jabbing slabs of raw meat on large forks and dunking them in boiling broth (after waiting for 45 minutes) is easy enough for even a dumb ass like me to figure out.  And twenty five bucks for what was basically nachos (with stale chips)?!?!  Never again...
