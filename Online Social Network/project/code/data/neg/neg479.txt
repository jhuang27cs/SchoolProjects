This facility was recommended to us by a friend, so clearly we thought it would be great. Despite the fact that the employees barely speak any English (including the owner), we decided to give it a shot.

After touring the place, we find out that people are there 24/7 (such a plus!) and even more, the dogs aren't locked up or in crates--but instead, they run around and play all day with other pups. We were sold.

While on vacation, we called twice to check up on our dog and were told that everything was fine, he was eating, taking his medicine, etc. Then we pick him up. Not only is he a huge mess--filthy and unkempt--but he has a horrible eye infection and is very sick.

No one said anything over the phone about this or mentioned it when we picked him up. Needless to say, we refuse to go back there and will never recommend this place to anyone.
