This place is a pretty good place to meet up for just having a talk with a friend, but not so much if you want to get work or studying done.

The place is always stuffy, internet is slow, and the place is just too loud.

In terms of food, it's pretty mediocre. The price for a sandwich and salad is about $7, but the sandwich itself is pretty empty. The salad consists of a few greens and some balsamic vinegar. The sandwich is toasted bread, tomato, cheese, and your choice of meat (of which there is not much).

I wouldn't recommend going here for a meal, but the staff of the place are pretty nice if you ever get the chance to talk to them.
