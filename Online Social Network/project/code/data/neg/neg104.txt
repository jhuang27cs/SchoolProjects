I would put Hong Kong on a list of the top ten places in Boston where you are certain to get eye f*#ked by a thirty-something white guy grinding by himself in early 90s style denim jeans.  If you can avoid this guy and love  getting down with your friends to generic, loud dance/top 40s music, then you'll really like this place.  If you aren't into packed, cheesy meat markets, then this probably isn't your bag.
