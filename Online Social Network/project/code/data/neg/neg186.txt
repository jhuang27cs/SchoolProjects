This is the first mexican restaurant I've been to that didn't serve free chips and salsa.  I ordered a quesadilla and it was around $8 for a taco bell sized snack.  My friend ordered a taco for $3 it was possibly the smallest taco I've ever seen.  I was still hungry when I left.  I don't know if it's because of the economy or what.
