I ordered from this place using seamless web. It took an hour and forty five min for me to get my food. I called after waiting an hour and I was told "it would be there in a few mins" ...it came forty five minutes later. My little juicy dumplings were dry and crusty. The house special lo mein, tho I had requested to spicy, was very bland and extra greasy (even by bad chinese food reaturant standards). The only reason I gave it two stars is that miraculously it came piping hot after 1hr and 45mins from placing the order. There was absolutely no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long what so ever! If this place had the last morsel of food in the entire state of NY, I would start eating my left nut before I ever would order from them again! You've been warned!
