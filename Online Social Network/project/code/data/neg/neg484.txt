OMG this place was a bad dining experience. The music was so loud we could not hear each other. I went here with my deaf friend David who wears a hearing aid and he had to turn the hearing aid off because the music was so loud. Our waiter smelled like Weed & Cigarette smoke and to top things off my chicken sandwich was borderline burnt. I will come here for cocktails just not dinner anymore.
