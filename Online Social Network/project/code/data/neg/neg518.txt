I have never written a review on Yelp and didn't plan to. But I just feel the need to warn other people about Falafel on Broadway. I ordered the chicken over rice with fries and my girlfriend ordered the veggie platter. The chicken was SO dry that it tasted like jerky and I can't imagine how long the chicken sat on the grille before being served to me. My girlfriend's veggie platter was so sour it was tasted ridiculous. Now girlfriend is extremely tolerant when it comes to food and for her to tell me something tastes disgusting, it definitely meant something.

 I should have been smart and realized that there were NO OTHER CUSTOMERS at 6:30pm on a Monday night. But mistakes were made and the only thing I can do now is to warn you from going there.
