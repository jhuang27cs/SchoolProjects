This was my favorite restaurant in Westwood.  It is family owned, authentic and the food is delightful. Unfortunately, I will never step foot into this place again because of how badly my friends and I were treated yesterday. He asked our friend to get up and leave when she did not order food even though she was sitting among three paying customers. We let him know that we came here all the time and he simply said to us "well...never come again." It was widely outlandish and completely rude. I'm so sad that I can't enjoy the wonderful food, but I've never been more disrespected at a restaurant. 

I highly suggest not eating here.
