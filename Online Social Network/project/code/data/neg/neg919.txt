No. This isn't Italian food and considering my brother was up all night vomiting, I find it hard to call "it" food at all. Please understand, I am not one of those uppity, pretentious food critics who judge every restaurant based on the best meal they had the Ivy but this was probably the worst meal I've had in a year. I had pasta with a seafood medley on top but the pasta tasted like top ramen, the clams clearly came from a can and the sauce had the consistency of a soup. Everything was just tacky, the food, the decor, and I'm sorry, but playing the Godfather soundtrack doesn't increase the authenticity of your Italian restaurant. I'm sure Babbo's serves as a nice refuge from all the quick food establishments for the UCLA students but it's insulting to charge the prices they do for the quality of food they serve. I hope this review motivates them to change their practices and invest in quality ingredients and chefs who know how to cook Italian food.
