I never knew this restaurant was located in the "Blue Sky Hotel" and was the reason why I never came here. I think they can do better than the "House of Curries - Indian and Pakistani" sign they have outside.

I ordered the chicken tikka masala as my first Indian restaurant experience. It's definitely a lot better than Naan N Curry down the street.

The meal didn't take that long to cook, and the naan was fairly soft-a little burnt.
