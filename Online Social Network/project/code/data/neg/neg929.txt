Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. That's my experience here and I'm not really going to try a third time.

I used to get my free student slice every couple of months while also buying a second slice of chicago style. On the rare occasion that they actually had any decent pizza by the slice, I couldn't complain since I was getting one for free anyway. Since returning as a non-student, two of the last three times they've taken my phone order, I've arrived just to have them tell me they didn't have that kind of pizza after all. I understand that mistakes happen (although I don't understand how you 'accidentally' tell a customer you have something in that tiny restaurant when you clearly don't), but twice? Really? What annoyed me to the point of never returning is that 1) they took my money before telling me that I would have to wait 20 more minutes for my order after calling way ahead of time 2) They lied about 'trying to contact' me...In the world of cell phones and caller ID, this excuse doesn't fly anymore, hombre 3) When I waited the 25 minutes (yes, longer than they said again), they didn't so much as offer a second slice or even offer a 'thank you' or an apology. 

Sorry Regents, your pizza is the best in the UCSD area, but it's not so good that you can charge as much as you do and have such terrible customer service. For now on I'll take the slightly inferior quality of Papa John's next door and get any large pizza I want for 10 bucks. If you haven't tried Regents yet, give it a go. I think you'll soon find out, however, that bad customer service+slightly better than average pizza at a premium price=I'll go elsewhere.
