If you can, avoid this place on College Night.  It seems like all the students from local schools swarm this place and the lines are ridiculous.  I've been to a "Mongolian BBQ" restaurant before so I'm familiar with the concept.  I think the management of this place could've spent more time on logistics though.  Lines just kind of form out of nowhere.  I was also amazed that I received my dish, since there didn't seem to be any method to the madness.  The service is slow, but like I said, I visited on College Night when they were slammed.  The food is alright.  (I guess part of that depends on what you create.)
