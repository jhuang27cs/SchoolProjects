I'm writing this review to tell you to read the other reviews!!! Customer service is virtually non-existent, slow Internet, non working air ducts, no HD satellite dish are only a few things that give this company 1 star. I emailed my land lord Rebecca regarding the slow internet and how it was virtually impossible to do proper research for school, to which she replied that Internet speeds were normal. I've resorted to spending my nights in the library or star bucks with hi-speed.  The office is run by what seem like students, who probably have little to no experience in leasing, so don't expect to be treated with respect. Students catering to fellow students? Yea, no.
