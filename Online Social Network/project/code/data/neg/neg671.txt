Our decision to go to shin's sushi bar on a late Wednesday smelling of smoke and beer, was prompted by the fact they were open after 9pm. The greeting we received from the staff was friendly, as was our server,  though she was also pretty awkward. She handed us shiny new menus that were much more impressive than the old ones; and shin's still offers an assortment of half off rolls. Which is great. 
The decor in shin's is new age sushi-karaoke bar, without the karaoke. There are giant TVs adorning almost every wall, which my colleague found very distracting as he has "screen addiction". I don't like the fact that there are A LOT of tables, next to tables, next to tables. I also didn't like the fact that only one other table besides ours was occupied. Never a good sign. 
The food arrived quite promptly. 
Ninja roll- consistent. 2 stars.
Yellowrin- alright. 2 3/5 stars. 
Shin's special- 3 1/2 stars. 
Gyoza- 2 1/2 stars. 
My colleague and I decided, both having been to shin's previously, that the food is good value for the money... 
Is it though?
