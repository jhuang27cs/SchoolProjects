I've always enjoyed walking through Toy Joy and spying all the random tchotchkes.  They have an abstract collection of items that often have no rhyme or reason.

And, yes, I typically leave Toy Joy with a least a couple of things that I don't need but can't live without.

My main complaint about this establishment is that I know how much they pay for these things.  They mark-up most of these prices 5-6x.  Some are marked up 10x!  And yes, the economy is rough and rent is high.  But, for those prices, I expect better customer service.  Their customer service is beyond lackluster.  It's not memorable.  Their cashiers are there just to take your money.  They rarely have answers to any questions I ask.  When I need help with a price (with such a large inventory, they often have things without price tags), they find the price for you - eventually.  Believe me when I say they never make me feel like a priority of any sort.  Really, I feel like a nuisance.  Yes, they somehow spin the encounter to make it seem like it's MY fault the price is missing.

So, do they have a fun collection of toys?  Yes.

Is it worth the up-charge? Only if you're unwilling to find it someplace cheaper.   

Does their customer service make paying a little more worth it?  Heh.  No way!  Their terrible customer service means that I'd rather have to bust out my ninja like google-fu in order to find everything they sell online -- for far less money then they charge.  And heck, most of those places offer free shipping.  Typically, I like to keep my business local.  But this is one establishment that I just don't feel deserves my business.  But, hey, it's probably my fault.
