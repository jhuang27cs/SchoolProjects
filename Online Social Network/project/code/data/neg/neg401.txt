So it just so happens that the first time I have ever tried a dosa was today from this truck.  I am hoping that what I had today was not what a dosa is supposed to taste like.  

I think my review is a little biased in that part of the reason why I didn't like the dosa was because mine was filled with cilantro (i don't like cilantro), but also from an unbiased perspective, I think that the dosa filling (both the potato and sweet potato) was just so sour!   So much so that the sour taste completely overpowered the lentil crepe shell.  I feel bad for writing this but I really wasn't sure what I was eating apart from mouthfuls of sour mush.   I did like the actual lentil crepe itself.. but that itself isn't going to cut it for me.

To be fair..  I think I just happened to choose a flavor that I didn't end up liking.  Will try again when the opportunity arises.
