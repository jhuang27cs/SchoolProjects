If there's one reason why I won't come back, it's THE SMELL.

I know this is a little vegetarian-friendly japanese place, big on the seafood, but the smell of low tide is overwhelming.

There are five tables here. One can seat about 6 or 7 people, the other can seat four. The other three can seat two. That's 17 people. There are also about 10 stools at the bar. So if you come in with a group and the big table is taken, you're pretty much going to be looking for another place to eat. This place is TINY.

I'd actually call it almost a romantic dinner type of place if it didn't smell so awful (sorry I'll stop complaining now). But one more thing, our wet, greasy waiter also smelled like he just came off the fisherman's boat. Was he the cook AND the waiter? Possibly.

On the plus side, he was very jolly and attentive. Super nice, besides him almost not letting us eat because there were four of us with the POSSIBILITY of a fifth person, and the big table was already taken.

So while I was there, I got a bento box. Steak skewers, noodles, slaw and edamame. The steak skewers tasted a little funky, like they were cooked along with the fish. So I only ate a few bites of those. The noodles were not good. The edamame was very undersalted (if you want good Edamame, go to Ebisu!), and I'd have to say the best part of the bento box was the coleslaw. For 15 bucks.

The portions for anything else were TINY. My friend got the shrimp plate and got, I think, four or five shrimp. I think it was 8 bucks or so.

The one redeeming quality of this place is that they have crushed ice, which generally excites me.

I won't ever come back here. It wasn't the service or even the mediocre food, but the smell of seafood in such a tiny place was just nauseating. Sorry Ama's.
