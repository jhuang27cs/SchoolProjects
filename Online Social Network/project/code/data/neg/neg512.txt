Hate to diss this place, as it used to be better, back when the pomme frites were thin and crispy. Something has changed here, and it's not for the better. During my most recent visit, I sat in the back past the bar area. There was a waft from the bathrooms that (thankfully) was like dirty floor cleaner. Many tables in the center were unused and not set, giving the place a feeling of being closed for business. The shaken martini was quite warm, as if there was an ice shortage. The English muffin style bun on the bistro burger was stale and judging by it's unmelted state and lukewarm temperature, the patty had never been in the proximity of the cheese while hot. I did not want to complain to the awkward, casual young manager/host, as he had an overly casual attitude that was well, awkward. Overall a weird, disappointing experience.

I spy: (Pay attention to the trompe l'oeil mural. Most of it is quite well done, save the woman depicted in the last booth in back--she looks like a slightly bloated corpse. You'll see what I mean...)
