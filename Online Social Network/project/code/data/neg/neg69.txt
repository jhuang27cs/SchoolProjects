I've been here twice.

The first time was last summer for brunch. I found the brunch food to be good actually. I had the lumberjack breakfast or whatever it's called (eggs, pancakes, sausage). Our waitress was nice but made all kinds of serious math mistakes when she tallied our bill. 

The second time I came here was the other night for dinner. I ordered a turkey burger and my friend ordered a cheeseburger. Neither he nor I realized that the burgers did not come with lettuce or tomato or any basic toppings. Just a dry burger patty with a burger bun. Seriously? Why would anyone want to eat that? Disappointing. Our waitress was nice and the bill was added up correctly this time. I highly recommend eating at the place across the street instead, Community Food and Juice.
