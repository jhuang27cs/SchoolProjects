I've been here a bunch of times with my coworkers during lunch.  We usually have a pretty good experience, but today was horrible.  It wasn't crowded when we got there (around 12 pm-ish).  The server took our food and drink order right away, but the food took forrrrrrrrrevvvvvvvvverrrrrrrrr to arrive.  AND... when the food finally made an appearance, our fries and onion rings were cold and our burgers were lukewarm.  We were too hungry to ask for new dishes, so we ate what we were served.  One of my coworkers had asked for ranch dressing when he ordered his burger.  Did he get ranch dressing?  Not until he was halfway done eating his food.  That same coworker also asked for a refill of his drink.  The server either ignored his request or forgot about it because we never saw that refill.  The server also messed up on our bill because she charged one of my coworkers for a beer that he never received.  Major fail on the server's part today.
