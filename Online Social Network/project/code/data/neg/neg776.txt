I use to love this place until I placed a catering order with sarah for a platter of 15 sandwiches which I wasn't told the price over the phone. I love to support local business so I figured I would spent 60-70 bucks but when they told me $138, i fell on the floor. i left a message for Sarah to call me and she never did, then I left another message, still not return call and then another.....at this point I will just stack it up to poor customer service and make my own breakfast sandwich going forward. It's a shame but you can't run a business like this guys- Sarah and Orlando....shame shame shame on you!
