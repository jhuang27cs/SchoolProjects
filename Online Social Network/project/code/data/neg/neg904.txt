The food was mediocre and service was just plain bizarre. This was picked because it was mid point for us to meet and have brunch.  We waited at the door for a few minutes before we saw anyone. We were seated in an almost empty place. I was unclear who was who once we were seated. The host came over and reviewed the menu, a waitress came by and reviewed the menu, a guy came with peanut butter scones and choc chip muffins. Not exactly adult food, so maybe this is a family place? The host came back and took our order. offered to add more veggies to my omelette but didn't know which ones. Thenhe  insisted that the chef come out to take my order personally. as if that would make a better omellette. I had to insist that the omelette I ordered was fine, no need to bring out the chef. It was so bad that I finally put my head down becaus he was so gd insistent that the chef come out and not listening.  The tea was not hot, the milk for it came after my meal. The "special" omellette was cold, the potoatoes cold,  no toast and no one asked about my friends sandwich. but we were asked multiple times about the omellettes. I felt like I had walked in to the stepford restaurant.
