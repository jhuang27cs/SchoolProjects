I brought in two bikes to be repaired and both repairs took over a week. I'm a bike commuter! I need my bike! One bike came back without the new pedals and one came back without a new derailer. They took off the charge for the pedals when I mentioned it. Since they were now out of stock, I had to walk my bike home. I had also put a helmet on hold and they had sold it a week later when I came to pick up my repair. When I noticed my derailer hadn't been repaired, I decided to take my business elsewhere. CB is too pricey for bad service!
