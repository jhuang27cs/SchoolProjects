i know, im kicking it while its down but College Perk was kind of lame. Not that convenient, not that cheap, kind of clique-ish for D&D dweebs who think bad guitar and trite lyrics are "deep" while trying to grow facial hair to varying degrees of success (dont forget the ponytail and wizard t-shirts!). They should have pushed for better entertainment, but there was no quality control. Once the dominoes started to fall in the direction of outcast patrons, they completely isolated outsiders of their niche.
