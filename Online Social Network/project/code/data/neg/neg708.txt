Food: OK
Service: TERRIBLE

If you want good pho, just drive the few extra miles to Convoy. 

We weren't greeted for 15 minutes after being seated. Ordered egg rolls, spring rolls, a regular pho tai plus tofu and a regular pho gao with extra meat on the side (in broth). They brought us a large pho tai and regular pho gao BEFORE the egg rolls, and completely forgot about the spring rolls. And the meat had a questionable color to it. Then they tried to bring the spring rolls as we asked for the check, which they charged $3 for tofu, $3 for extra meat and $3 for broth.

Overpriced and not worth the wait/service.
