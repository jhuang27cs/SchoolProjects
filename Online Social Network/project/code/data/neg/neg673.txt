The ATM here has been broken on 3 separate occasions in the past month. I'm switching banks. I originally chose this bank for it's social/environmental policies but I don't know if those are still in the picture now that they are Eastern Bank and anyway it's gotten where the service is so bad that it's not worth it to me any more.
