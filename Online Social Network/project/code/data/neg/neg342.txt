2.5 stars

I feel bad for the low rating because the people are so nice and it  feels like going over to your grandmom's house to eat, but the place just isn't anything that I couldn't make myself.  The food is cheap, and definitely a good place if you're in the neighborhood and too lazy to cook anything yourself.  The baklava was the highlight of my meal, though it was a tad dry and probably had a bit too much spice in it.  The rest of the menu is just standard fare: eggs, breakfast meats, burgers, etc and none of them are executed with any kind of greatness that would make me come back on a regular basis.
