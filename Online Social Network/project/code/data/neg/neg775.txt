We have walked and driven by this place so many times and it always smelled great, so we finally decided to check it out.

First, the good.. the service was excellent.  They were friendly and quick and kept everything flowing nicely.

Unfortunately, the nice wait staff couldn't control the food.  

Okay, maybe we just ordered the wrong things because they are known for their burgers, but neither one of was in the mood for a burger... so I got the "fish and chips" and my wife got some type of turkey melt.

The fish was a mess... you bit in and the fish pulled out of the fried shell.  The fries were just greasy.

The bacon on my wife's sandwich was chewy/stringy .

Maybe if you are going for a drink or burgers, this place is great, but I wouldn't recommend going there for dinner!!
