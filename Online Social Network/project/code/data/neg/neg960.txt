This review is only based on the food because I've never actually been to the restaurant. Espiau's had a food stand at the California Beef Festival about 3 weeks ago. Now normally any food at events like this tastes good because you've been drinking all day. Well, not this food. I ordered 2 beef tacos which turned out to be kind of weird. They were made of shredded beef on small corn tortillas used in street tacos, but they had shredded lettuce and cheese like a fried hard shell taco would. And the tortilla was semi-fried which just made it seem like it was stale. Chips and salsa were good, but I will not be going to the restaurant.
