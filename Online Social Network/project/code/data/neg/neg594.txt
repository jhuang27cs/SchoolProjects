I wouldn't of reviewed this place except it was already listed in Yelp...

Boy, these guys are the worst lawyers I have ever met, and I got 2 in my family already! After an exhaustive search for entertainment lawyers, this was the only place I could digg up in Boston. Sheesh!

So, I walk in the office right in the middle of prime Harvard Square real estate, whoa, I'm ready for some serious business. Peek in the door--no bloody receptionist. "Helloooo!!!" I'm greeted by two rather shady looking guys by the names of Tom and Ray. One them slaps me on the back and says, "Welcome to Dewey, Cheetham & Howe, Shameless Commerce Division, how can we help?"

"Um, Yes, I have these contracts I need to review for a talent shoot tomorrow and this clause, uh, right here...."

"HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!" They could not stop laughing until they exhausted all the oxygen in the room! I got serious problems with my studio contracts! How unprofessional! So then Tom, pointing at his brother, Ray says, "Well, whatever it is, HE'LL take care of it, but don't drive like my brother!" "HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!" Ray is like, "And don't drive like my brother!" "HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!" I was ready for the ether, you know?

I'm so offended! I will never take contracts there again!
