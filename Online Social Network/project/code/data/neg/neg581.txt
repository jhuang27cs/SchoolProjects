We went to Moving Image for pre-wedding dance lessons. Our expectations were realistic - neither of us has dancing experience. We just wanted to learn a simple dance. 

What you will find is that the "Dance Academy" is really just one person, Ken Kalowy. The phone number listed on the webpage is his cellphone. True to his word, the lessons are private lessons at the Ethical Society on Rittenhouse Square. 

Our frustrations was two-fold. We felt like we were being pressured to make many dance lesson appointments. It was obvious that he wants you to come in for as many $90 (45min) lessons as possible in order for him to maximize the money he gets from you.  Our other frustration was his style of teaching. He is a poor communicator and instructor. He will teach you very little in each lesson and focus on the things that won't help you at the wedding.

Overall this was a bad experience. I have many friends who took about 5 lessons before their weddings and seemed to have a much better experience. I would recommend you go to another instructor/academy.
