Go see someone else.  ANYONE else.  This guy has no interest in you unless you are a surgical case.  He has no bedside manners and is so abrasive.  I'm simply amazed that he's still employed with such a respected facility.  I'm horrified I went to see him and actually went back to see him again.  What a waste of my time.  And I'm still at square one with my joint issue.
