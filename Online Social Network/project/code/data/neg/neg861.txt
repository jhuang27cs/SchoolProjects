I came here with my parents and it wasn't a pretty dismal dinner.  It didn't help there was some girl at a large party behind us who had this laugh that was so loud, it resonant through the entire basement eating area and she seemed to think everything was funny.  But the food itself kinda sucked, I got some combo platter.  Wont be coming back!
