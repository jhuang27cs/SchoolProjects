I don't love this location at all.

When I heard Blick was coming to Central Square, I was super excited. Let me back up, I'm that guy who loves a perfect pen, amazing stationary, and little trinkets. I'm obsessed with notebooks, paints, and various art supplies. I was really scared I was going to spend all of my money here.

Alas, that was not the case. Maybe I am critiquing so harshly because I love the Fenway store, but there's something missing. 

When I walk into the Fenway store, I am bombarded with so much crap, I don't know what to do with myself. The staff there is always friendly and I could honestly spend hours in the store looking at all of the stuff. 

This is not the case here, though. It seems to me, and maybe I am wrong, that there is half the normal junk here. Where is the huge selection of pens? Markers? Paints? I don't know, it's just too much of a change for me.

The staff at Central Square isn't the most friendly. But, maybe I am judging (again) because I assume the staff at Fenway are also students at AIB, MassArt, or other art schools so they are pretty interested and passionate about what they are selling (this could be a total lie, but at least they dress the hipster part).
