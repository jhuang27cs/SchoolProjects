The food is usually good there but on one occasion I ordered a piece of cake for desert and since the play is darkly lit, it too a couple of bites to realize the cake was moldy! The waitress seemed horrified and was extremely apologetic. She took it off the bill and offered another desert but I declined. It makes you wonder what other food they have back there that is clearly old. I've been once since just for drinks but it so crowded we left after one drink.
