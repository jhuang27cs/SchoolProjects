What happened?  This Hobees used to be very good, but no more. During several recent visits, I've found that the quality of the food has declined, the restaurant isn't clean, and the service is just ok.

If you need to take a trip to the restroom, you will walk right by the kitchen and it is FILTHY.  Try not to look, or you will wish that you hadn't eaten your meal. Oh, and when you get to the restroom, it's dirty too.  I wouldn't dream of eating anything from the salad bar anymore.

All in all an unappetizing, disappointing experience.  What a shame that this is what's become of what used to be a great local restaurant.   

Pros:
Red, white and blue smoothie
Coffee cake

Cons:
Dirty kitchen
Dirty bathroom
Food doesn't look or taste fresh, especially on the salad bar
Lackluster service
