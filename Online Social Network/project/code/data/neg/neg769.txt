About 2pm I slipped and fell at a supermarket in Redwood City. I must've hit my head because when I came to, I was being attended to by an emergency crew with an ambulance. The EMT asked me what day it was. I was woozy and couldn't answer him. He had my wallet with my Blue Cross card.
They took me to Stanford Hospital Emergency Room. I had a neck brace that hurt my neck. I laid in the hallway for a while. Then they rolled into a room with several other patients. I was there for a while. The attending physician asked me if I was in pain. I said my neck hurt from the brace. He aked me a few more questions, filled out some forms, asked me to sign them. They took an MRI. A different physician came by and said to rest for a while. 
They rolled me back to the room. I fell asleep. I was woken by somebody throwing my shoes and jacket on top of me. I looked around and saw two attendants in the corner of the room shooting the breeze. I sat up, put my shoes and jacket on.
A volunteer (he was wearing a volunteer name tag) came and asked me if I was feeling better. I said I was thirsty. He got me a cup of water. Since the attendants were busy with their own conversation, I went to the front desk and asked what I was supposed to do next.
They said go down the hall and go into the second door to the right.
I thought I did that. I went through the door and found myself outside in the driveway. I just walked to El Camino, caught the bus back to Redwood City. It was 11:00 pm. I just got in my truck and went home.
