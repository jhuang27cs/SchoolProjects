OK, this has got to be the most gross place in all of Pittsburgh.   But, Because of it's notoriety, I thought I would make a stop at the "O" and at least give it a try.  I had a dog (with the works) and ordered fries, just because it was suggested to me that they give you the most unbelieveable size of fries you have ever seen.  True enough - they were large, and actually quite good.  The dog, well.....let's just say it was a hot dog, nothing special.  The lady behind the counter cooking the dogs is a real hoot - if nothing else, stop in just to check her out.  Everything in this place is sticky and greasy, but you know even before you go in what to expect just from the exterior "ambience."
