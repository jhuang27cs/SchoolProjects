I've eaten at Grindstone Charley's a handful of times over the past few years and have yet to be impressed.  This time out I ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The burger looked great, but was without any real flavor.  The fries (small crinkle cut) were tasty enough but not worth going out of your way for.  The waitress was friendly and did her best to stay on top of the large group I was a member of.

Based on the folks I passed on my way out, many local senior  citizens love the place (I mean, there were A LOT of senior citizens there that day...like a whole sea...seriously...).
