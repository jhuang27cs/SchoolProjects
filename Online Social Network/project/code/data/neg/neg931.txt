The gym itself is clean and nice. There are plenty of machines and I only felt like it was too crowded at peak hours. The classes are great, especially Augustine's Zumba class and Steve's cycling class.

The staff at the front desk is friendly and nice, but they have a VERY high turnover rate, so you'll practically see a new face every time you walk in.

That brings me to management. For a family-owned gym, I think Breakthru is very poorly run. They have a hard time holding on to employees and they will make your life complicated if you try to cancel. They are neither understanding, nor gracious. They will absolutely try to milk you for every last penny before letting you walk out the door.

My advice? Try the gym free for 7 days. If you like the atmosphere and don't find it too crowded, give it a shot. Just expect a new person to greet you each time you walk in and plan on working out with them for the rest of your life ...

Good luck!
