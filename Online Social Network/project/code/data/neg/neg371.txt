It's not that Raku's food was inedible or vomit-inducing.  Rather, Raku's chefs managed to ruin their nigiri by pairing perfectly decent raw fish with random ingredients-- everything from cream to citrus to jalape√±os to some creamy citrus sauce topped with jalapenos.  Then the owners charge an extra chunk of change for these "creative" fusion sauces.

Let me try to say this in another way: the best part of my meal was the miso soup.

Maybe the yataki, ramen, or Americanized sushi rolls taste okay, but we won't be coming back here to find out.  And as for the ambience... Don't come here if you don't like having a loud waiter banging on your table for no apparent reason.
