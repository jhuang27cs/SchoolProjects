Came to this CPK last night with the hubby and a friend of ours. We shared a grilled vegetable salad and a BBQ Chicken pizza. The pizza was delicious but the salad was disappointing. There were hardly any grilled vegetables, the salad dressing was flavorless, the lettuce was gross but the avocado was perfect. 

The main reason for this review is to address the service issue. 

We were greeted 10 minutes after being seated at the table with "you ready?" What?! No "hello", "my name is", "welcome", "can I get you some drinks?" Okay.... Strike 1..... 
Dinner is dropped off with a "here you go" What happened to "can I get you another drink because they're obviously empty" or "is there anything else I can get you?" Strike 2....
We went parched without refills for the entire meal. Eventually she asked if we needed refills when we were done with our food. Never asked "how is everything?". Foul ball....
To top it all off "Did you want the bill or dessert?" strike three! You're out!

On top of it all other tables were "trucking it" or "same-siding it" (whatever you want to call it) and making out through their meals.... PLEASE PEOPLE I'M TRYING TO EAT!

Worst service ever gets 1 star
Add another star for the yummy pizza and clean bathroom.

2 stars total and we'll never be coming back here!
