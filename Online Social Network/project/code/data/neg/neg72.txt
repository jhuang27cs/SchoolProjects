I use to be a huge fan of BJ's. I loved the pizza and the pizookie! Yum. 

But I went back and it was not the same. The food was medicore. Salty, greasy, and overcooked. The pizookie, which I had hoped would be delicious, was gross and tasted artifical. 

The waitress was really nice and funny but really slow. BJ's did not make for a quick lunch.
