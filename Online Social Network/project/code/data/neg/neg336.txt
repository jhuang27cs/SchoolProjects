I came here to satisfy a boba craving and left unsatisfied.  Their milk tea boba is absolutely tasteless and really watered down.  The only reason why I could imagine someone coming here is because it has wifi and is close to UCLA... as for myself, I'd much rather spend my $2.50 on a Stan's donut or a slice of pizza at Enzo's.  

One star for location and one star for good customer service.
