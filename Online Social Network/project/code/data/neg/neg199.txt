One word: Overrated.

Judie's famous popover = a muffin/croissant hybrid. Flaky, tasty, and 1800 calories EACH. (not including the apple butter accompanying it)

Caloric content aside, I was disappointed with my follow-up visit to Judie's. I was introduced to the popover paradise by my favorite Smithie foodie back in 2002 and I recall it being delightful back in the day. However, my impressions of "the new" Judie's are:

- Tacky decor
- Poor food quality that has definitely nosedived in quality (DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN SALAD unless you want to pay $14.95 for a stack of iceberg lettuce and a few sad strips of chicken)
- Cheerful, competent service (but it doesn't make up for the food :( )

My girlfriend had the Souper which I wish I'd gotten instead of my chicken salad. It came with french onion soup which was tasty but salty. Her boyfriend had a turkey popover pot pie which he seemed to enjoy with a starter of seafood bisque.

The hubby had a "very average burger" with a side of fries that he called "fish fries" since the batter tasted like it was fried in the same oil the fish sticks were. Eww.

All in all, the experience was underwhelming and the highlight was definitely seeing, catching up and exchanging Christmas presents with my Smithie girlfriend. Sorry Judie's, but I probably won't be back.
