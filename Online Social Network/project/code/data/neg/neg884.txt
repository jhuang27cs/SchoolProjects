A little over Priced, and they really need more than one person making sushi. There was hardly anyone there when I went, and it took me 30 minutes to get my sushi. 
I'd rather go to Haruki's and have bad service, but have my food handed to me quickly. 
The saving grace for the place is the fact they have a FREAKING SHARK in the tank behind the bar. That is freaking sweet. I could have sat there watching the shark swim around all day. 

I didn't have any drinks, the price of the sushi turned me away from ordering anything other than two different types of rolls. 
It was a bit dark in the place, and to be honest I'm not sure how I feel about that. 

Certanily not Kid Friendly. It's one of those Resteraunts you want to shoot people in the face for bringing their screaming kids. It's just too small and the atmosphere screams " Let's relax. OKAY."
