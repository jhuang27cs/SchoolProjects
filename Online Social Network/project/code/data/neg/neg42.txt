We've been here for dinner, and were in the neighborhood so decided to stop in for their happy hour.

And what about the dinner.  I liked the chicken, and gf though the duck with dry.  Ambiance was great, though felt way too open inside, and we sat at a table that felt like it was in the center of the room, all alone.  Normally I'd like the distance from other diners, but it was a bit much.

As for happy hour, there were lots of options and prices were great.  We liked the drink menu, and wen't across the board on the cocktails.  Friend of mine got the Mule, which he said was too sweet.  I went with the tea time, and it was so sweet my teeth and gums hurt.  I actually had to ask for a cup of club soda to water it down, and it was still too sweet!  Also, if you tell the waitress your drink is WAY too sweet, she should really take the drink back.  Gf had the citrus splash which she said was too sweet, until she tried mine.  It was much more tolerable than mine, but I wouldn't say it was good.  One of the people in our group ordered a Sprite and 

We wanted to try some eats, so we got the beef sliders and the kale salad.  The sliders were very good... for sliders.  The burgers had a chunky tomato sauce, like one you would put on a pasta, instead of fresh tomoatoes (nice variation).  They also had a special sauce on them.  Beef wasn't overcooked, as it tends to be on small burgers.  The kale salad was really good, except for the fact that it WASN'T A KALE SALAD.  Go over to Akasha, they'll show you kale salad.  It was mostly lettuce, and again very good.  But when I order kale, I'm hoping to get kale.  Wonder if they have a beet salad; maybe it has kale in it.

We didn't have the best experiences, but I might still come back for a $2 Pabst and some more of those fancy bar food selections.
