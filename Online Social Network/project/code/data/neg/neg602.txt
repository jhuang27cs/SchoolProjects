as you walk in  - please note the GRADE B sign. i dont know why i even gave this place another shot. i work in century city and westwood ends up being a good middle place to meet your friends for drinks.

note: happy hour does not apply to alcohol.

the biggest complaint that i had about this place aside from the horrible college crowd, obnoxious music, horrid sushi, limited menu, were the bugs that were EVERYWHERE. in the sake around me, around the food, around the table. they were small little flies / gnats. SO GROSS i felt like i was eating by a trash bin.

its so sad to see that the once beautiful euro chow restaurant has been taken over to be so gross and low quality.

only go if u have strong stomach and can risk taking a couple days off in the likely chance u get food poisoning.
