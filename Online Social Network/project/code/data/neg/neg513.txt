Do you love In N Out, but feel like they just don't charge enough for their delicious food and outstanding service? Have you ever bit into a freshly-made Double Double Animal Style and thought "Gee, I wish I had paid way more for this delicious burger"? Well, now you can! Try Pie N Burger! It's the same food, but with way more attitude, zero cleanliness and absolutely NO customer service in sight!

I don't care how many top ten lists pick this place, I'm NEVER going back.

Everything tastes identical to In N Out, only they charge twice the price. Seating is hard to come by, especially with the people who just sit and talk at their table long after they've finished their meal.  The restaurant looks dirty. Try not to stare at the greasy, grimy grills while you eat. Their desserts are good, but sometimes you'll get a piece that's stale. No bueno.

My reason for not going back? The staff is incredibly rude. I was ignored for my entire last meal because my "waitress" was talking shit with a coworker about some catering customer. She had called to ask questions about the pies for catering, and apparently this was unacceptable to the employees. They literally stood together for thirty minutes, just talking about how much they hated this customer. Seriously? 

Bring cash if you still decide to eat here. They have an old-fashioned cash register and don't take cards.

Honestly, the service is so bad that when Yelp asks if they have waiter service here, I'm going to select "not sure".
