I really wanted to like this place given the dearth of sushi restaurants in the area.

For the price and quality of the sushi and rolls, I'd have to say that I've had better.  All of the rolls ranged from $6 to $16 (with veggie being the cheapest and the crazy rolls with everything and the kitchen sink on the high end).  The nigiri ranges from $3.50 to MP.  

My biggest gripe has to be the size and quality of the rolls.  They literally fell apart when I picked them up with my chopsticks.  And they must have been running out of rice because I could see more seaweed than rice.
