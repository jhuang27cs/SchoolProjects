I've eaten at Zocalo twice, and never been too impressed. The prices are extremely high for food that is hit or miss.  On a recent lunch trip the shrimp was quite over spiced, and the beans rather watery. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the Mexican food of New York, but charging for ordinary tortilla chips and salsa seems rather silly to me. Both times I have been there the restaurant has been almost empty, likely reflecting the fact that the portions are too small to be worth the price as well. Service was decent but all in all the lunch felt like a waste of time. Just up the block is Lemongrass, a thai restaurant which is a much more satisfying dining experience in my opinion.
