I'm not really sure what the hype is about this place.

The food is extremely unhealthy and that not exciting or even high quality.  The building makes up for some of the weaknesses in the food.  And every time I've been here, all of the employees' "What'll yah have?" has been as enthusiastic as a man asking for a prostate exam.

All in all, I guess this place is a landmark, not much more can be said.  Might as well stop by once.
