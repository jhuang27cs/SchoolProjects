I don't really know why subway gets such great reviews. It's good when ya dont have a lot of time to get something, but their prices aren't anything spectacular and the food is even worse. I should have gone up to Crazy Dough and gotten some slices. Would have cost just as much and I probably would have left a whole lot more satisfied. I saw a Zagat rated #1 sticker on the counter....... I'm guessing their standards are slipping.
