I am also displeased with the results of cosmetic surgery that I had - tummy tuck and lipo on the lower half. He "gave" me flanks, which I hadn't asked for (think of a racehorse in motion, that big crease through the top of the thigh/butt), the lipo in that area was uneven, resulting in a big bulge at the top of my thigh. I found Kincaid to be very cavalier about giving certain (useful) information. He also took out the drains too soon which resulted in an infection and an unsightly scar.
I can't really recommend him - I look fine in clothes, but can hardly look at my own body now. :-(
Update 3-27-12: I continue to be displeased with the results of my surgery, and so have downgraded from two stars to one. Certain areas of my body looked 'swollen' as a result of the pulling for the tummy tuck, and he said they'd be back to normal after 12-18 months. It's now been almost two years and it's still not right. If he'd only told me the realities, but he admitted that he doesn't tell patients the whole truth re pain, swelling, after care and the condition you'll be in after the surgery, "because then nobody would do it". I'm a calm and reasonable person, and for me to still be this displeased this long after surgery will hopefully communicate my frustration with the whole experience. You can go in there and tell him what you want, and he and his staff will tell you all the right things (which are obviously scripted), and then he'll do what he wants to do. Buyer, beware.
