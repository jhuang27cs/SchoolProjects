Nothing special here. Empty around the time of fourth meal, and utterly unappealing. I came with an appetite of course, and settled for pepperoni classic just to satiate my hunger. It was greasy, spicy, but in a quick-made college student with a microwave manner. I felt that it was also overpriced at about 3 dollars a slice since the ingredients seemed cheap. The employees seemed like typical college hippies that didn't give a rat's ass about the lone customer waiting for help. Hmph. *crosses arms*
