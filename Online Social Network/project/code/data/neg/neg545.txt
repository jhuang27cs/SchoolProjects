I'm sad. As a self-admitted chocoholic and dessert extraordinaire, I was so excited that there is a bakery right down the street. After a most excellent dinner at Little Azio, Hubs and I headed next door to satisfy our voracious sweet tooths (teeth?) at Bakeshop. 

Cons: 
Selection: Not much of one. Granted, it was a few hours before closing time so maybe all the good stuff was gone already. 

Price: 14 bones and some change for 1 cupcake, 1 slice of cake and 1 torte. Really? On the bright side, at least now I know what it feels like to get a swift kick in the balls. For $14, it better come with a foot massage. 

Taste: Epic fail. Hubs' chocolate cake was flaky and dry (how does cake frosting flake?) I made a chocolate cake last week for Hubs' birthday (out of the box, just add water and an egg) and it blew Bakeshop's chocolate cake out of the water. My chocolate pecan torte was so salty that it was inedible. The chocolate cupcake was decent but I ended up giving half to the beagle because the chocolate frosting was weird...more like a mousse but with a strange flavor that I just can't place. The beagle seemed to enjoy it though... 

Pros: I like the communal seating. The guy at the counter was super nice and helpful, we asked a bazillion questions he answered them all without getting irritated. The maintenance guy (or Bakeshop employee assigned to mopping the floor) was totally nice and pleasant! I want to go have a cup of joe with him. They each get a star.

I will give Bakeshop another try. I really hope they were just having an off day.
