Wow, for all the hype about this place, nowhere near great. I do remember ordering Pad Thai from here once and it was okay. However, since I had never been to the actual restaurant, my friends and i decided to stop by

I don't know why we had such a bad experience, but let's just say all our noodles were so overcooked they were melting like cheese. Noodles were definitely not meant to taste like cheese. 

It was an overly greasy and kind of sickening experience. The atmosphere isn't too shabby, but it's just a hole in the wall kind of restaurants. The service was nice and fast, but the price overly expensive for such a restaurant. 

You can go to any other of Ithaca's deluge of Thai restaurants and be much more satisfied. Taste of Thai just down the street in the commons is the same price with a much better atmosphere and better food. 

Skip this place, the food quality in this place has definitely suffered recently.
