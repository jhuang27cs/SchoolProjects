I have a dry sense of humor, but not as dry as the mushroom power V crepe that I ordered.  Sounded absolutely wonderful on the menu, but wasn't.  No flavor, nothing to keep it together and the buckwheat crepe was....crummy and I mean crumbling apart. My friends has some different ones and they were the same...dry, no sauce at all.  The strawberry/fruit crepe at least has cream on it...add some sauce people!!  If we hadn't gotten them to go...would have gone back and said something.
