I haven't made it to the buffet yet. I've had two sit-down meals here, both in the late afternoon when, each time, there was only one other couple in the restaurant.

Shalimar is completely uninspired. The decor is bland, at best. The service squeaks into the "passable" range, but not by a lot. Both times we've gone there, we've heard the guys back in the kitchen shouting loudly to each other. Last time, the "host" was on the phone loudly discussing his plans to get KFC for dinner. This time, the "hostess" was wearing an oversized t-shirt, sweatpants, and flip-flops. She also deemed it appropriate to vacuum a few feet away from us while we ate our appetizers, and to stand and hover at the table while I signed the credit card receipt.

The food is adequate. I wouldn't call it GOOD Indian food, but it's certainly edible, and I've definitely had worse. It hasn't made me queasy, which is always a good thing. The prices and portions are reasonable.

I would definitely suggest coming for the buffet if you're thinking about eating here. Like I said, I haven't done that yet, but I'm assuming the food is of equal quality, and therefore the significantly lower price will make the whole experience a more palatable value.
