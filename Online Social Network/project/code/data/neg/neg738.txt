Calafia is dead to me. 
It was a Sunday night and the restaurant was steady but not packed. My brother-in-law, myself, and my baby sat at the bar to order take-out meals and enjoy a drink while we waited. We sat down and it took a few minutes before Mike even greeted us with a quick over-the-shoulder 'I'll be right with you'. He did eventually get to us and we ordered beers. He did not offer us menus or ask if we were having dinner or any further inquiry. I got up and got menus from the hostess. Still with the menus sitting in front of us, we couldn't get the bartender's attention to place our order. I sat at the bar and used my cell phone to call the restaurant and that fantastic petite hostess kindly placed our order, because the bartender seemed busy she said. 
Mike never came back to us. So when another server came to the bar, I asked her how I could get my phone order. The bartender was coming back and she mentioned it to him, he turned to us and said, 'Oh, you have a take-out order? You called it in?' He didn't even know we had placed an order yet he never asked us if we wanted anything. 
The entire situation was pretty unbelievable. Friendly service helps smooth over the mistakes. The service was neither friendly nor attentive. I've had a few average experiences at Calafia and many good ones. The average experiences never kept me away but this one has.

The GM said he was going to "make it up" to me but he never replied to my email.
