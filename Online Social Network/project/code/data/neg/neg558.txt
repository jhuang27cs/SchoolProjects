What kind of buffoonery is this? I heard nothing but good things  about this place so you can imagine how dissapointed I was when entering the establishment. I felt like I was in my grade school cafeteria. Holding a tray walking around looking to "deebo" a table from an unsuspecting family. Not only did the environment seem like i was back in  the gradeschool cafeteria the food tasted like it was cooked in a gradeschool cafeteria. I had a hot dog, hamburger, and the orange slushie. It was DISPICABLE!!  lol...yes i have to use words like this because I couldnt believe what people consider a treat. The only thing good about this place is plenty of parking space...if it wasnt for that I wouldnt have rated this eatery. It deserves NO star...the shittiest place i have ever eaten at.
