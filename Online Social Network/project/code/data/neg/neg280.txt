One of the worst situations at a restaurant is to watch a logistically inedible dish at your table just sit there losing all its appeal.  With the correct planning and service this can be easily averted and corrected--however, the spotty service at Malbec prevents its true potential from coming through.  Instead, what's left is a cold glob of cheese sitting in a puddle of oil.  Yum, can't wait.  Oh, I forgot, I don't have a choice.

Best Quality:  Atmosphere.  
Slightly formal, kinda cute, a tad noisy for a casual conversation when it's packed with people (which was the case on a Thursday night).  It draws from the older, local Pasadena crowd, and you might feel a little out of place if you don't order wine (maybe *that's* why everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves).

Aspects to Improve: Value, service, food.  
[begin rant] They were out of bread (really?) when they served us the cheese fondue appetizer.  We sat there watching the fondue coagulate into a lump of cheese and oil.  Please--were we supposed to dip a spoon in and eat the cheese like a soup?  Were we offered a comped appetizer, an offer to heat the fondue back up, or even an apology?  No.  Drinks/water apparently refilled only upon repeated request.  Surprisingly the waiter didn't recommend the skirt steak (which I thought would have been a shoe-in signature dish), but instead suggested the twice-as-expensive filet mignon, with bacon and a peppercorn sauce that muddled the flavors of the already slightly bland filet mignon.  I would have expected more flavor from Argentinian food.  At least they know how to cook a steak to its desired doneness.  Disappointing experience with a $35 per person price tag.
