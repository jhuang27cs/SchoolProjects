Note: This is based on my one and only experience here. 

I had the Po Tak Seafood. Described on the menu as: 
Hot and spicy lime basil soup with Tilapia fillets, shrimps, squid, imitation crab meat, mussels and scallops, Thai chili, Thai basil, galangal, straw mushrooms, shallots, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, roasted chili pepper and cilantro.

The broth was totally acceptable tangy and spicy. It's the seafood that was the bummer in this dish. Scallops were rubbery and had an off taste to them. The shrimp was also tough but edible. The tilapia was ok. All the seafood in the dish has obviously been frozen. I didnt dare try the the mussels especially after my one bite of the off scallops. 

My husband ordered the Pad Prik Pao with Beef.
Described on the menu as: Choice of meat stir-fried with chili paste, Thai pepper, fish sauce, brown sugar, green onions, yellow onions and cashew nuts.

Holy Mother of Stink! Wow! Like someone came and punched me in the face with a giant sponge of fish sauce. 
i mean, i'm a big believer of fish sauce. i really am but this. This was something else. The stench made my stomach turn. I looked in horror as my husband took bite of his meal. 

Me: "How is it?"

Husband: "The fish sauce is a bit strong."

Me: "You think??"  As i turn my head away from the offending plate. 

He also said the onions were raw. There is only one other place in Austin that serves worse. It's downtown *hint hint. 

Service: Great. We had no problems. Server was nice. Drinks were filled. 

This place. I dont get it.
