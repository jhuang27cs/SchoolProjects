I don't get this place.  At all.  They don't offer anything innovating or different.  Tank tops for $20.00???? I can get better quality at Old Navy for a fraction of the price. They have an impressive collection of leggings, but minimum $26.00!?!?! WTF, and most are more than that!!! Holy crap.  Jersey knit dresses/skirts for $40.00.  WHY do people buy this crap??? Go to Target or Old Navy and you can get the same shit for pennies compared to the prices here.

The staff is friendly, but it's like they all call each other up in the morning to discuss what they are going to wear.  They all wear a combination of the same thing.  So skinny jeans that if you move in the wrong way they will explode off of you.  Aforementioned $26.00 tank top and some kind of leather vest over it.  Add a bandana or two, slick your hair so you are a wannabe Emo but are sooooooooo over it, and BAM, you have the staff of American Apparel.

My BF's brother shops here.  He doesn't really know when to stop spending money, so it's appropriate that he wastes it here....
