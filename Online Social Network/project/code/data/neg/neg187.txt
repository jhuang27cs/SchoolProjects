Alchemist & Barrister was entirely disappointing. When we walked in it took more than five minutes for a host to approach us and another 5 to 8 minutes for a table, even though some were clearly available. After settling in, the server took several minutes to arrive, even though she was taking care of tables nearby. I couldn't catch her attention if I had three heads! 

We had Ana Luisa's Empanadas to start off our meal. The three stuffed pastries were dry on the inside and outside with very little flavor to save it. Even drowning it in the accompaniment of salsa verde did not help.

I've been more in the mood for vegetarian options lately and decided on the Vegetable Paella. It had eggplant, portabello mushroom, chickpeas, peppers, fennel, shallots, saffron and was served over brown Basmati rice - topped with tofu. How good does that sound?! It seems the restaurant makes up the lack of food quality by putting it in nice looking dishes. Although the bowl looked great, the food did not. It was bland in color and flavor. The rice and vegetables were just submerged in, what seemed to me like buttery water?

My friend ordered the Irish Pub Lamb Stew and again very little flavor. It was supposed to come with carrots and red bliss potatoes, but the whole dish had only one or two pieces of each. My other friend ordered Shepherd's Pie with lamb. It was actually the best dish out of the three. Although, that's still not saying much. If you're stuck between the pie and the lamb stew, definitely go for the pie.

Alchemist & Barrister looks appealing on the outside. The entrance is on the side of the building with a charming stone pathway and the outdoor patio must be nice in the warm weather. I can't say the same, though, about the service and the food.
