Over the past few years in Providence, Spice has remained the same. The food is always OK, not good or great. Just low-mediocre. 

On my most recent excursion I wanted something super spicy- I had a cold/virus/fever etc. and I needed to sweat the sickness out. I asked the waitress for recommendations for something that was extra spicy. She recommended the red curry with chicken. The service was normal for take out, about 10 minutes. 

So how spicy was the curry? Far from inducing tears or burning my mouth. Yes, I was sick and probably wasn't able to taste everything, but how is the red curry supposed to be their spiciest item on the menu?!
