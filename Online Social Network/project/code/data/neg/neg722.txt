2 stars for cheap food and breakfast burritos served all day.  That's about it.

On one occasion, I ordered the chorizo burrito w/ egg.  Not too spicy, but over saturated in grease.  Not the best I've had before, but I'd order it again (for lack of better options).  It's nice that it comes with free chips too.  Probably one of the better priced menu items.

On another occasion, I wanted a California burrito without the fries (they use thick cut fries and I am a huge snob about my Cali b's.... it's shoestring or bust!).  The guy asked if I wanted rice and beans, which I interpreted as if I wanted to make it a combo with rice and beans on the side.  My mistake... the rice & beans went inside the burrito.  I almost cried when I found out ... (as someone who was raised on SD Mexican food, I'm - sadly - extremely picky about my burritos).  The meal was kinda overpriced for such low quality food.  I wouldn't pay $8 again for this quality of steak (very dry).  They also use whole avocado slices instead of guac. Errrrr.

ALSO! They don't have hot sauce.  I mean, they give you one variety of "hot sauce" which is just medium spicy salsa.  They should get the red red hot sauce (or at least some other options), as I think it would be an inexpensive way to flavor their dry food.

Would I come back? Yes, only out of convenience and because I like breakfast burritos... they are generally hard to screw up.  But I'd definitely skip on going out of your way to dine here.  And if you do, avoid their regular steak burritos ... they taste like they were made in Nor Cal ... T_T
