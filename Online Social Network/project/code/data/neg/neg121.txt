$30 for a dozen "gourmet" donuts? Good god. Just because it has peanut butter on it doesn't mean I'll shell out all that extra cash. The donuts themselves aren't that great at all, but I think that because it's a landmark here in Westwood people want to believe that it's really good. But, in all senses it's the "Pinks Hotdogs" of the donut world.

For the rest of us who aren't shitting money, Winchell's down the street charges 1/3 of the price for the same thing.. minus peanut butter.

A joke between my roommates and I is we bet a number of Stan's donuts as the currency for our wagers. 3 donuts is almost $5, so you can see how quickly it can stack up!
