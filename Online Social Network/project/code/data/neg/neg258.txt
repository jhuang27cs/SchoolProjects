I stopped by here on a Saturday evening for dinner. I thought it was decent but not above average by any means. I had the lentil soup, which was good, the lamb biryani, which was OK, and baklava for dessert, which was passable. The biryani had a nice aroma and flavor, but the lamb was full of fat and gristle, so much so that i finally gave up trying to pick out the eatable meat slivers with my fingers. At least my fingers smell good now.
