one of the worst clubs i've been to so far, if not the worst. the line was crazy long over 45 mins wait. and it is so packed inside you can't even dance. i was soaked with sweat 5 mins in and it wasn't even my sweat, it was from the people around me, because it was packed like a sardine can. the music was ok, some of it was weird and not club type of music and some were decent. one thing i liked about it though, is the club has seats all around the sides so if you get tired you can sit. other than that i give it five thumbs down.
