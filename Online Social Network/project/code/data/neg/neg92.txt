Decent sandwiches and salads, but the process of queuing to order, then queuing to collect the food, then queuing to pay is just too long and ridiculous if you plan to be out in less than 15 mins. Plus, I've been 4 times, and the women at the cash register never even acknowledge customers, just chat amongst themselves.
