Pizza is ok but whats with the attitude?  Not cool or hip to get snide looks and attitude for ordering two slices, getting one, and asking for the second slice that you had indeed ordered... whose fault is that?  And whats the big deal, just heat up the slice of pizza.  Instead, I got a whole of of eye rolling, pizza slamming, and gnashing of change.  Whatever.  Would rather just get pizza than drama.
