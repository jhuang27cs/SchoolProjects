Had glasses filled and needed a pair of sunglasses and because they were specialty glasses for motorcycles I had my perscription and went to another provider but it was missing the PD measurements. Called the office and was told I had to speak to the Dr. but would call me back in 5 minutes. Waited two hours and called again and was told that the Dr. doesn't give out that information because "if it is wrong they don't want to be responsible" First of all thats rediculas. I paid for it and medical records are to be made availible upon patients request. Secondly I had my first pair of glasses made from those measurements and had no issue, why would they now be wrong from a professional. I was forced to go elsewear and PAY another eye doctor to take those measurements.
