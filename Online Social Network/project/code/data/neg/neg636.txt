R.I.P. Star Chicken. I've never actually been inside of you, but you were always there during several UCLA affiliated catering events. I went hungry during those times because of you. Your chicken had no flavor and your sides were atrocious. Sorry it had to be this way, but you just couldn't make it through the competition. May the ghost of your star logo haunt many a landfill for decades to come.
