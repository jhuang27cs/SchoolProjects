I ordered a 'Panini' and didn't get a panini. I don't see how you can name your place Panini Deli, then offer a sandwich called the 'Panini' that is not, in fact, a panini, but a regular cold sandwich with hugely thick bread. Sure it was on the menu that said 'cold sandwiches' at the top, but why would I even look and consider that as a possibility when the name is 'Panini'???

Meats are low quality. I really couldn't get past the subpar meats. I had salami, pepperoni and ham, but could definitely taste bologna. If you have those three meats and you taste bologna, that means the meat is cold cuts. Gross.

The decor was ok, but the lighting was atrocious.  25 cents for a water cup. They also use those huge, styrofoam cups that will be around long after the restaurant goes out of business.
