Currently, I have a membership with LA Fitness. I am in the process of searching for a new gym. 
Here's the deal with the Pasadena LA Fitness...

1. TOUGH TO GET PARKING. The parking spots you are permitted to park in are few. The rest are reserved for employees at the other business that use the parking garage. There are times that I've had to park my car and wait for 15 minutes just for someone to come out of the gym so I can follow them to get their parking spot. This is acceptable at a mall, but not at a place I'm paying for.

2. Ohhh, THE SMELL! I get that this is a place for sweating but the smell in this gym is beyond what you should have to endure during your workout.  It smells like they've never aired out the place or opened a window. It's just offensive.

3. BROKEN, BROKEN, BROKEN. Everything is broken here, and I'm not just talking about the equipment. I stopped going to this gym for a while because their AC broke and it took them 4 weeks to fix it.  NO AC at a gym for 4 weeks!?!? Unbelievable.

4. CROWDED CLASSES. Some of the classes have WAY too many people in them, to the point that you don't even have enough space to work out in. The staff at LA fitness will never regulate this and you'll have to attempt to work out in a 2'x2' square. Go ahead, try out the Monday 5:45 step class. If you like slamming into other sweaty people, you'll enjoy it.

The only good part of this gym is the Tuesday yoga class at 8pm. Great teacher. 

GOOD LUCK GYM HUNTING!!!
