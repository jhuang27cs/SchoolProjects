It's unbelievable that people actually flock to this place.  I've been dragged there on two occasions: large group dinner outings for birthday celebrations, etc. and I've absolutely hated the experience BOTH times.  The wait is painfully long for such a gimmick!  You serve yourself pretty much crappy stirfry that you have a lot of potential to mess up if you pick a sauce that just doesn't work with your food selection and you pay crazy amounts  of money for this!  I'd never go here again... and I'd never recommend it.
