I went here for a hair cut. The lady charged me $10 extra because I had wavy hair and it would take longer to style. There was hair in the sink, when I got my hair washed. And I left with more than my hair on me. Needless to say I will not be going here again. Oh and my whole haircut took 40 minutes.
