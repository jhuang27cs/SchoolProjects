Meh. The first time I tried Smart Alecs, the food was actually good. My fries were fresh and I really like the sauce they have for them. 
However, on my most recent visit, the food was terrible. I had a cranberry turkey sandwich, with fries on the side. The bread for the sandwich was extremely dry,  to the point where it was pretty obvious that it was stale. On top of that, my fries tasted old, and they were ridiculously hard. My friend who had ordered right after me apparently had fresh fries instead, so I ended up eating hers :) but yes. Definitely hit or miss but I was soo disappointed that they served me these outrageously old fries that I will probably only come during really busy times to make sure my fries are fresh. 

Oh, and this was originally 1 stars, but 1 extra for the huge portions and cornbread.
