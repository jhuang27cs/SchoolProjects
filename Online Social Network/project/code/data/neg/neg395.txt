Zigo is not a place that you would go out of your way to travel to.  Think of it as a slightly more expensive and creative version of Au Bon Pain that also sells really random side dishes and prepared food.  

I used to work in Kendall Square and found myself back in the area again today.  I needed a quick portable non-messy lunch and I decided on Zigo.  So essentially I guess their slogan "Good food for busy people" is pretty much on the money.  Thinking back on it though I worked in Kendall for about a year and very infrequently got food from Zigo.  My main reason was that I wanted to avoid becoming destitute just because of eating lunch.  Today for instance I got a sandwich and a drink and that ran me about $9.  A tad bit expensive.  

My main interaction with Zigo over the year that I worked in Kendall was running down to fetch and carry numerous coffees and sandwiches for my evil, evil boss...but that is another story.  Anyway I learned during that time that the guys are super nice and always had a smile or some interesting tidbit of conversation.  

Specifics on the food is that it ranges from ok to pretty good.  Tasty cookies, really great Turkey and Brie sandwich, selection of healthy meal additions like yogurt and fruit.  Also I just found out that they stock HonesTea which is a fair trade iced tea which I always like to see.

Bottom line is if you work/live/are currently traversing through Kendall try out Zigo but by no means travel any far distance to eat there unless perhaps your boss (whom you do not like) is buying.
