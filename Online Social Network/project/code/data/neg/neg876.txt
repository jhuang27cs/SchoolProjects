I used to love the sandwiches here until I fell ill after eating one.  I have found that their policy of wearing gloves while handling food is not strict - most of them are handling the veggies and meat without gloves. I am a meat-eater so no probs with mixing veggies and meat but what about hygiene? Even subway and quiznos does this much. 
The reason I feel it is the sandwich that caused me throwing up all night is bcoz my friend mentioned she found mosquitoes/flies in her sandwich once. I wouldn't have opened to see whats in mine but that sounds disgusting!!
