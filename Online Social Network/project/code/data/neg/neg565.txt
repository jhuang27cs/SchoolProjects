This place must have the largest cost/value gap in Chapel Hill. You can count on meager, boring, and oddly repetitive dishes at truly astonishing prices. The yoghurt drink for $2 is the only thing on the menu that approximates reality. There is simply nothing in the food to justify the pretentious bill your server will politely deliver. Nothing. Walk down the block to the Mediterranean Deli for better and more ample fare at 1/3 the cost. Won't do this one again.
