This was my first visit to Tammy's. When I walked in I thought the placed was the cleanest, well kept salon I'd ever seen. My manny/pedi with Kim was AWESOME! She wen to town an my lovely calluses (lol) although it was pricey. If I had only done that I would've given Kim 5 stars. 

However, I also had my eyebrows waxed, by the owner, Tammy, in business for 25 years, and she TORN OFF MY SKIN ON MY EYES! She went too low with the wax (too much wax maybe) into the more delicate area above both my eyes and removed skin. It was the last thing I had done so I left pretty qiuick, but my eyes we burning on the 10 minute trip back home. As soon as I got home I saw what she had done. I had scabs over my eyes for 5 days AND the were swollen. DO NOT GET WAXED THERE!
