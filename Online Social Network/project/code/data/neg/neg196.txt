They get one star because the food was good, and one star because i like crepes. But I surely won't be coming back here again. 

This place was way too small and crowded. People were crammed in here and there were not enough chairs inside and out. They use plasticware and paper plates which is very unfriendly to the environment. 

The people inside were generally annoying. One college girl snatched my chair without even asking if I was using it. 



But the worst experience was that I'm SURE that I handed the cashier a $20 bill to pay for my crepe. The cashier claimed that I gave her a $10 bill, and only gave me $4 in change. I was extremely mad, but because I'm a wimp and there was a line behind me, I decided not to escalate into a full fight.
