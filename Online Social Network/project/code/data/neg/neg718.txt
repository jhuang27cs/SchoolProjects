Specifically for the happy hour: It is crowded (booths/stools, everything!) by 5pm. You have to be willing to make like a hawk or a stalker at the shoulder of a bar dweller waiting for them to leave so you can scavenge their warm seat. 

Once seated, good luck getting the attention of the one bartender until 6/7pm. He is super nice but clearly stressed as demonstrated by the sweat on his forehead and the furrow in his brow. It was stressful just watching him, let alone ask for a glass of water!

That said, the drinks and food are super cheap at 6 small ones each but nothing really to write home about. The pink, diet-tini (i forget the name was actdually dangerously good) but the burger, although a huge hunk-o-meat, was just that, a not very flavorful hunk-o-meat so you really have to rely on the condiments and that small slice of bacon to give it any umph. The skinny fries - SOGGY and blah, even after a couple vodka martinis. The spicy shrimp was actually very good but cook anything in butter and even your shoe is yummy.

If it weren't so darn sardine-can crowded, I'd go back to order the drinks but I'm not willing to race anyone to grab a seat. Call me antisocial.
