AWFUL!!!!!  I cannot stress how much I hated going here. SWITCH NOW OR DON'T EVEN COME HERE!!!!!! 
#1 its filthy.  Downright disgusting in there and smells awful.  It isn't warm or welcoming, it's so gross.  UGH!  
#2 their receptionists are often rude and their phone lines are always set to their away message (ie. hasn't opened yet, or they are out to lunch) even when they are supposed to be there, and this almost ALWAYS happened when I called.  I would literally call at 2pm and their lunch message would be on or at 10 saying it hadn't opened yet.  SUPER ANNOYING.
#3 some of the nurses are plain rude and not nice.  I went to the same person consistently (Katie Mcdonald who is actually very nice and helpful) but one time she had called in so I was given a different woman (not sure who).  She basically refuted everything Katie had told me and marked me as an idiot because I kept saying it was against what Katie had told me and Katie had been my nurse practitioner for years.  I was furious.  

I could go on.  I absolutely hate it here.  When I switched I couldn't even believe what I was missing.  I never knew a gyno office could be so nice since I was subjected to Clark's dump for so long.  (I suggest Josefina Marin--an absolute doll and her office is super clean, welcoming, smells nice, much nicer staff etc) 

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
