There is really no reason to review a bank, unless your experience at a particular bank was exceptionally good or unbelieveably bad. In my case, it was the latter. 

We got a deposit check back from the property manager and so I walked in to this branch with my roommate to cash/deposit the check. Walked up to the counter and was told that they could not accept the check because of some technicality about endorsing signatures that I had never heard of and didn't quite understand. The teller could not have been less interested in my situation and when I asked her to clarify, her response was basically "I'm not gonna do that".

Fine, on to the manager then. He told us the same thing and explained the situaton a little better. It had to do with the teller taking on liability by accepting this sort if check and basically, thus particular teller didn't want to. Instead of trying to help us, the manager suggested that we deposit the check through the ATM where it might be returned or TRY ANOTHER BRANCH. WTF? 

We needed to deposit the check so we tried the branch on Wilshire and there were absolutely no problems. The teller here took the check and deposited it, no questions asked. 

I think I'll just bypass this branch in the future and bank at a location that knows how to take care of its customers.
