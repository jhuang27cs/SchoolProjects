This was a great place in the 1980s.  They offer a more interesting selection of sandwiches than a lot of local places.  My experiences since they moved "across the road" have not been so good.  Service is passable to very slow.

The last time I was in there, the waitress told our table a particular beer was on special.  When the check came, it was regular price---the waitress was confused about what night it was.  Neither the waitress nor manager was willing to honor the price we were told even though they both understood we were told a different price.  I don't recall ever being treated with such indifference.  I guess they do enough business that they don't have to worry about individual satisfaction.
