There was something wrong with this burger. It was really dry, and really big. I can't complain about it being undercooked or anything, but it was definitely a trial to eat. The fact that I was really hungry and had to STRUGGLE to finish it means two things: 

1- it was REALLY BIG (got the reg fatburger)
2- it tasted pretty unappealing

Probably not going back here. I like the burgers from those greasy diner type places better (yellow basket, golden eagle, yorgos, fantastics, etc)
