A/C broke.  Repair person came out pretty quick, diagnosed to simple part, but said would cost near $1000 to fix.  Later I found out the part could be obtained on the internet for about $100.

Based on the high cost to fix, I went with a new Lennox system from them.  (At the time they did not mention it, but it turns out their parent company, Service Experts, is really owned by Lennox, so if they recommend that brand, it is probably because of that and not necessarily objective.) I believe the price was in the OK range.

The salesman had assured of a few things, that the installers were experienced, well-trained, and not beginners, that the house would be left cleaner than when they arrived, and that it would be done right.

However I think none of those things were true.  There was quite a mess that had to be cleaned up of dust, metal scraps, extra sheet metal screws, etc. which showed that they did clean some stuff up, but clearly didn't do any care in vacuuming or checking for objects.
They also did not install the A/C correctly, and it needed service within a week of installation, even the tech admitted the installers erred.
Finally, the A/C plenum and where it connects to the vents, the top of the furnace, and around the drain pipe leaks air like a sieve.  I've read online that part of the hallmark of a professional install is sealing the connections to the ducts well.  In this case, it is bad enough that there is a wind in the room and that room gets freezing cold due to how much air leaks out.  I'll have to fix that myself with some foil tape and silicone as I don't think we want them back in again if we can help it.  The air filter is also held in by a screw and a folded piece of metal and is bending upwards at the sides letting air pass it by and I'll have to figure out a more "professional" way to fix that.  I know I'll do a much more careful job, so it really isn't worth having them come do it.
