This is a review of the bar, and it's a short story about deal breakers. Having a small bar area is okay, but you've gotta know how to utilize it. You don't do that with huge, circular booths that seat less people than the actual bar area does. Having nowhere to sit is alright, but having nowhere to stand--not even a patio? That blows. Not that it was even busy enough to be so full.

But I digress. You might be wondering "Taric, tell us why you have an axe to grind with their bar?" It's because I was pretty hyped for the house margarita. I asked for it on the rocks, and glanced over as the margarita was simply poured out of the jug. At most bars, the price would get me something at least made to order, and of better tequila than some bitter well swill. I can already tell this place is questionable.
