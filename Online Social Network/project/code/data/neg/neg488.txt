I've been here for pedicures and for waxing.  

The waxing was the most painful waxing of my life, to the extent that it put me off it for over a year until I realized it didn't need to be that bad.  I had even taken advil beforehand.

The pedicure could have been fine but they shooed me off too early and as it was winter, the polish got completely mangled and the pedicure ruined.  I had to go back the next day to get it fixed and, to their credit, they grudgingly did so for free.

Not very friendly, either.
