I went here for a work event recently, and all I can say is "never again". Granted we had a large party, about 20, but we'd called ahead. We had one server for 20 people, and clearly she was out of her element. Three of the first eight orders brought out were wrong. The food came out staggered, one woman got her salad, and then ten minutes later we got our appetizer, and ten minutes after that we started getting the rest of the food. My fries were ice cold; they'd obviously been sitting for some time. The guy who asked for no cheese because he was allergic got cheese, returned the sandwich and didn't see it again until we were ready to close out our bill over half an hour later. More importantly on a party of 20 I know they were charging gratuity. We could not beg for drink refills, which was stupid on her part because most in my party were drinking beers or mixed drinks. And before you think it was a rowdy bunch, it was my companies quarterly finance meeting, all accountants with an average age of 45 so our rowdy days are over. It was so bad I was embarrassed and I didn't pick the place.
