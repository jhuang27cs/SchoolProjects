I was on a quest to eat at every Indian restaurant in Berkeley and this place was definitely the bottom of the barrel. I went for the lunch buffet. I scoped it out first and thought the selection looked fine. However, the food tasted horrible. All of the vegetarian curries were bland and mostly just tasted like tomato paste and potatoes. I didn't eat the meat dishes but they looked like they might have been better. The naan and rice were fine. The rice pudding was disgusting- it was sour. Being the cheap person that I am, I usually try to go to a buffet mid afternoon and eat enough to fill me up for the rest of the day. But I could not force myself to eat a second helping of anything here. There's plenty of other Indian restaurants on University for the same price but much tastier.
