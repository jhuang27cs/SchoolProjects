Ok decided to write another review based on my experience last night.
The bouncers SUCK. Like they are unnecessarily RUDE. I'm pretty sure they're told to be like this though but honestly, this isn't Vegas. It's Berkeley. You don't need to act like that to get people inside your bar. 
My friend went in by herself and heard the security say "I can't wait for a group of people to come so I can tell them to wait." Really?

I would actually like this place if they got rid of this stupid attitude. Actually I think a lot of us would.


I just added a star because I know the management is really trying to deal with the negative reviews they've received. Hopefully things turn for the better and this can become another iconic Berkeley spot.
