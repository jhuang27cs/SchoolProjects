This rating requires a story.  Once I tried cooking mongolian beef at home.  I was disappointed with the results.  But at that point I hadn't eaten mongolian beef in many months, and I wasn't sure if I did it incorrectly or if my memory of mongolian beef was better than it actually is.  So I decided to go out to a Chinese restaurant to see what it should be, to compare it to my first-time rendition.  And this was the place I ended up at.  And it tasted nearly the same.  And I still didn't like it.  Since I hadn't been to this place much before, I decided to give my recipe another point of comparison and went to a Chinese restaurant elsewhere that people actually recommend.  And I enjoyed its beef.  And thus I learned that my rendition was indeed bad and in the process learned something about this restaurant...
