Service was just short of insulting. The waiter--I thought perhaps he was a manager, since he seemed unhurried and didn't appear to have responsibility for an area--refused our request for a wine list, and when one in our party asked for fresh pepper for her salad, he dropped off a pepper shaker on his next trip through--no salt. Norman's could give them a lesson in service and courtesy.
