I'm not going to do a review on Trader Joe's in general as a store, but on this particular location. 

Parking is terrible! SO crowded. It takes you a long time to get to the aisles for the parking because you constantly have to wait for people to cross in front of you. Then after driving around all the crowds, you have to deal with tight parking spots and bad drivers who don't know how to park properly. 

The staff there were just okay. They weren't particularly friendly and I have experienced better in other TJ's locations. (I like the one in Grossmont the most!)

If I could, I would really avoid this TJ's. Or at least don't come here during a weekend!
