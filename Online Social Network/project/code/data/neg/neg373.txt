Fidel would be disappointed. 

I sat there for over 2 hours with 1 drink and no food. Service was the worst I've ever had, and the manager tried to give excuses instead of just apologizing. We had a large group (10+), but they should've been more attentive. Food was underwhelming to boot. Hands-down (great cliche) the worst. Burger King has better Cuban food.
