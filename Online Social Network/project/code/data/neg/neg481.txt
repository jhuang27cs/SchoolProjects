I've been eating at Royal East for almost twenty years but I won't be any more.  The food has remained basically the same, usually good quality but the service was horrifying the last time I was there. 
It was 8:30 at night and they had obviously just finished serving a very large group.  Most of the tables were empty, but not in their usual places.  We were squished into the corner next to the one other table with people.
After we ordered, the wait staff started breaking down the tables and moving them all over the restaurant.  Our table was shaking like a San Francisco earthquake!
Thank God it only took about 10 minutes.  Once it was done the staff acted as if it had never happened. 
It's a shame because I have always enjoyed the food here.  But I work hard for my money and there was no reason that had to take place while we ate.
