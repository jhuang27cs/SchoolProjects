Pretty bad customer service. In fact, I ordered two items and only got one... of course I had to wait 15 minutes before I got my first order, had to figure out they didn't give me both orders, then wait until the cashier took another order on the phone before I ordered again. The food was nothing outstanding so I will not be coming back here again.
