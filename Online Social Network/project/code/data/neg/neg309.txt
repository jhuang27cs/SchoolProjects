If you're starving and everything else is closed, maybe give it a shot. This place is cramped and tiny you can barely walk around. Not even sure it's very sanitary. Not very generous with the portions either. I had to ask the guy twice to add more of an ingredient because he put barely anything on. After which he added a tiny amount that was kind of a joke. All in all one of the worst subways I been to.
