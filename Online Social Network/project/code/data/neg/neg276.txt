This place is highly overrated.  First, you have a hard time finding a parking space.  I had to give my keys to a bum, and pray that he would return my car.   We waited 5 hours in the sweltering heat with the rest of the herd, and we were finally seated.  They only have one item on the menu that consist of Chicken and Waffles, and I think it's an appetizer.   However, the smothered chicken was good, but I could have ate it at any run of the mill soul food restaurant.
