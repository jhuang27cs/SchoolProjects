I came in because I was starving and my bus ride home wasn't for another 30 minutes.

I ordered their taro bubble tea, and it was definitely not the best I've had.  Somehow, it lacked a lot of flavor and I didn't even want to finish it.  There are definitely better spots on The Ave for a bubble tea treat.  

I also ordered the hum bao which was okay, but nothing spectacular.  

If you want some good bubble tea, keep walking north and head of Oasis.
