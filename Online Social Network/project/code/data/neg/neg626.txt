first off, the service is outstanding. they were attentive, polite, and accommodating. the food, however, is lacking.

they have a whole lot of wine and the waiter recommended a very good cab, so +1 for a kick ass waiter with a kick ass recommendation.

i got the bone-in new york, where as my buddy ordered the bone-in ribeye. the steak took a while and came out overdone. we told the waiter, so he took them both back and brought us a new set. still dry. the ribeye was medium at best and my new york was definitely medium rare (as i ordered), but it was done black and blue style (charred outside, cold center). even with that, my steak was flavorless.

they could use more seasoning and maybe ease off the whole 1600 degree searing deal.

for sides, chipotle mac & cheese and the flemings potatoes. not bad.

since we weren't happy with our steaks, they comp'd our dessert, so we tried the dessert sampler. the cheesecake, creme brulee, and ice cream were good. the rest....not so much.

+1 for free dessert for ho-hum steaks. all in all, we paid $150 for the two of us (which includes tip) and although service was outstanding, i come to eat, not to be treated like a princess.
