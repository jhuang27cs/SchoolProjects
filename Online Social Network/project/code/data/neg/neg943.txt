L.A. is well known for it's authentic Japanese food. So if you're not willing or do not have the time to leave the UCLA campus for good Japanese food, then you should already know what to expect from Tsunami. You'll find mediocre sushi, okay udon and some pretty disappointing soba.

Tsunami actually does make its own sushi...sometimes. There are chefs that prepare basic sushi from ingredients delivered from Kikku, a Japanese food company in Southern California. The california rolls contain, to no surprise, artificial crab. The only sushi I would recommend is the Inari (hooray Vegetarian option!), but all packages are pretty expensive given the small quantity, some priced at almost a dollar per sushi.

The surprising standout on the menu is the Udon. For noodles, the soup is everything, and Tsunami's soup is not overpowering or bland. With noodle bowls you get enough noodles for the price. I recommend the udon combo with Inari.

I would only recommend eating here if you are desperately in need of a Japanese food fix and do not have enough time to leave campus. This is also the only restaurant in Ackerman that sells boba. Good for Tsunami, but that says some things about UCLA restaurants.
