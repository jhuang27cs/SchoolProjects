Step-by-Step Regression

Thinktank has been going downhill over the last year.  I can't think of a restaurant that I loved initially, that gets progressively worse every time I go.  The first time I went with a friend and we got the Seoul Burger, Pork Belly, and Duck Confit.  The Seoul Burger was super juicy and came with an amazing side of greens and a little kimchi.  All the dishes were of rock-star quality.  The second time I went, I discovered the amazing Vegetable Ramen that had unique veggies and a really light broth that I found to be very subtle, but amazingly good; however, the burger quality had diminished somewhat.  The third time I went, the Duck Confit had been taken off the menu, as well as the Vegetable Ramen.  I just went last week and the Pork Belly had been reduced to a Chinatown quality piece of fried pork fat.  It was despicable.  Also, the organic IPA that I would use to wash it down with was gone too.  I ordered the Seoul Burger, and that too had diminished in quality.  It came out essentially uncooked inside, so I had to send it in for a re-do.  Altogether, it was really depressing to see how bad a restaurant could get in a span of 12 months.  They need a new chef or need to move out.
