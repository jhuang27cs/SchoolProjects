On the food: it would be okay if I were stuck at an airport for days or on a desert island. Otherwise, it's overpriced and thoroughly mediocre. 

But what really gets me is the service; I've NEVER experienced ruder service in my LIFE. I ordered a black coffee yesterday; it was served with milk and sugar. I asked for another cup, specifying that I wanted plain, black coffee with no milk and sugar. It was served with sugar. WTF?!?! I finally got my plain coffee, but it was served with the heaping load of attitude and eyerolling. 

I live right next door, but unless I'm starving or it's free, I'm never going here again. Another example of an establishment that would fail miserably if it were located in any other neighborhood.
