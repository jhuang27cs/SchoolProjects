Mandarin House is awful. I would go here and keep trying to give it another shot, but as someone else said, it's not authentic, healthy, or even good. I would try to give specific dishes, but it's just as true to tell you that I've had many different things here and they're all just really bad.

The last straw for me is when I ordered szeshwan chicken and was served sesame chicken and she refused to remake my dish.

I reserve this for when I have the unusual craving for the worse Chinese I can possibly find. But even after I eat it, I'm dissatisfied because it's worse than I expected.
