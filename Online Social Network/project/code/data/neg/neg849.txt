Too bad I can't give 0 stars.  My friend and I both went here, had different barbers, and both got the worst haircuts of our lives.  My barber didn't appear to have any idea what he was doing.  I asked him to "thin out my hair", and he just looked at me with confusion.  I told him to use the "thinning scissors", and he still just looked confused.  I had to point them out to him.  He picked them up and cut in the vicinity of my hair, then said "Are you happy now?"  Worst.  Haircut.  Ever.
