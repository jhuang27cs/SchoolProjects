I was very excited to *finally* go to Rialto. After all, this is James Beard territory. But I left feeling unimpressed. The lamb was excellent (minus the too tough to cut fennel), small plates were OK, but dessert was terrible. Wine was good, but not great. The service was so-so. Honestly, if we ask the identity of a particular ingredient, don't make it up--go ask the kitchen! For these prices, I'd rather go to Craigie or Oleana.
