There is one thing I noticed about this boutique: their items don't really sell, some stuff have been there for several seasons, or even a year or two. Things only go on sale after they've been on the shelves there for years. My advice is do your homework before you buy things from here. Some things from the previous season or two, they might be on sale like crazy if you get them online or somewhere else, but YCI will still sell it at regular prices. I think they only give you store credits if you wanna return stuff. So watch out! Don't let the people at YCI fool you into buying something that's already been dropping in market value!
