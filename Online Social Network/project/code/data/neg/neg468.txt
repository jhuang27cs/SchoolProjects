Sushi was ok but staff was very unprofessional and not educated to give customer service or make customer feel comfortable around since they were playing and telling each other words that should not be used in front of customer like "vergon".  They were more entertained on playing with each other than taking care of the customers.  The girl who was there on 7/13/12 evening was on the phone and there were 2 customer waiting to be serviced.   Really?   I will never come back to this place.   Being in thbe medical center I was expecting better than this!
