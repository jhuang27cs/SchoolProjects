My family and I enjoyed our time here, but the aquarium in Virginia Beach, VA (my hometown) is MUCH better. Birch was very small, and I was very disappointed in the shark exhibit. The one in VA is HUGE. Not to mention two separate buildings that are connected by a huge trail through the woods. My favorite part of the Birch aquarium was the view from the outside tidepool exhibit, and seeing my daughter have a great time at the outside activities that seemed it was more for kids.
