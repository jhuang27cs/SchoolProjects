I ordered the Fig Mar burger. BLEH. I usually love cheese but this goat cheese was so pungent and strong it masked the entire burger. And the Fig Mar was interesting but it's so moist and so chunky it just makes the bun soggy.  The truffle fries are not anything special either. The best truffle fries I have had are from Umami, though I don't like Umami's burgers so much since the portion size is ridiculously small. I still love Father's Office, Back Abbey, and 25 Degrees the best for burgers.  Go across the street to Back Abbey and have yourself a real burger. I also tried my bf's Pearl Street burger and it was just okay to me...Rather go to in-n-out.

The day we went which was on a Saturday. We ended up getting our server switched like 3 times because they were going on break? we didn't even stay that long like 1-1.5 hours max.  The first female server was a b**** too.  The guys were nice and accommodating.

Maybe I ordered the wrong burger the first time I was here even though all the yelpers recommended the Fig Mar but this place just isn't for me. I will probably avoid eating here again and stick to my regular burger places.
