It is a shame that the physicians here are as good as they are and the facility is so poorly organized.  Here for a procedure which was scheduled for 9am or so i was told.  actually the procedure was scheduled at 330 pm.  Being a responsible person i had dinner at 6 the night before and didn't eat.  the next morning at 5 the tests began with everyone saying that 9 am was the time.  At 1 pm, they finally responded to me bitching and told me that it is still scheduled at 330pm.  that now makes it 26 hours before i will eat or drink anything.  this is ridiculous. Don't use this place.  see the doctors out of this dump.
