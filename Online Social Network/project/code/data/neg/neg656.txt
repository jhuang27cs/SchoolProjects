A cute looking place in a nice neighborhood with outdoor seating too.  From the reviews we weren't expecting much to begin with.  We had some PASSION FRUIT JUICE which was almost indistinguishable from the orange juice in my fridge.  Our main courses:

CHUPE, a large seafood peruvian stew which I thought was tasty though I could taste the seafood was not that fresh

SECO DE CERDO, dry meat on dry potatoes 

Overall, pleasant service and okay decor BUT not fabulous food for what it costs and the fact that my date said "well we're not going to peru if the food is like this!"--we likely won't be returning
