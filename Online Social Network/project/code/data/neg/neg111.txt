The subtitle for this restaurant should be - "home of the burrito of infinite regret"

Both my girlfriend and I were sick after eating at this spot. The burrito was large, but the meat was dry and the guac tasted terrible.

All in all, we would never, ever go back. Funnily enough, we also noticed that it was named RI's best mexican grill. We have decided not to return to RI for any period of time. Weak.
