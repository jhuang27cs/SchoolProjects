Look, everyone knows Characters deserves NO STARS, but that ignores how great it is to feel like you're on Cheers!  Really!  Like you're in the middle of a stage set that's built to resemble only those parts of a bar that are going to appear on camera, leaving whole swaths of it empty.  That mediocrity of this level even exists -- thrives, even -- is truly something to stop and take notice of.  

How you do it, Character's, I don't know, but no one else could.  On some level, I salute you.
