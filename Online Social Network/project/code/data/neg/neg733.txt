When we walked in, it was mostly empty, but half the tables were filthy, with old dishes, leftover food, etc leftover from previous customers.  It was a bit of a turn-off to me.  

I was also disappointed that they didn't have lunch...I went there on a Saturday at 1:30 PM and I was totally in the mood for lunch (and since it was called Brookline LUNCH, I figured my desire would be fulfilled) but they only served breakfast.

I got a breakfast sandwich with sausage and the sausage with chewy and over-cooked.

They forgot to bring my drink, too!!

I guess I'd give it a second chance but I was not impressed.  Frankly, the rave reviews shock me.
