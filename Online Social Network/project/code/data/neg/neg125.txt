This place is terrible. It looks nice, but this is a case of "looks can be deceiving". The workers have attitudes, and roll their eyes off when you speak with them.

The crepes are bad compared to places like Max Cafe (down the block), or Creperie ( West 4th)

Bad service and very rude. Not welcoming at all... Management should replace cashier and server. 

The only one who seemed friendly was the person making the crepes who didn't speak English. I feel bad for the guy to have to deal with the server and cashier who are both A-Holes.
