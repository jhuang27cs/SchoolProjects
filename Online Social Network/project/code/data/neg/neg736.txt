First off the store front location itself is dirty, there was a chair with no table in the little area where I assume chairs and tables were supposed to be. The guy behind the counter sat there with the radio blaring bad hip hop, and he was half asleep and responded with a "whatever" attitude when asked a question. So we left. That night we ordered online, and it took 45 minutes to deliver- the cookies themselves were too gooey to the point of being almost under baked, they weren't shaped like cookies- not even in an artistic licenses sense. They were literally slapped in the box and a blob of cookie mass :/. For the price, it is completely no worth it. Subway has much tastier cookies.
