I'm somewhat conflicted about how to rate Pappy's: for the event we planned there, and the service we were given, I'd give them three or four stars - however, by virtue of this not really being my scene, I can't justify more than two stars, as I personally won't be back. Read on for clarification!

We held a large party here several weeks ago, and were allocated a large space downstairs (where the dance floor and DJ was), were supplied with plenty of food (that was actually decent), and quickly fulfilled orders of beer. Working with the staff here, including the owner and manager, was easy and enjoyable, as both were very accommodating and friendly.

Unfortunately (and this is where my personal biases come in), once things started to pick up around 11pm that Saturday, the downstairs dance floor became a giant, hot, sweaty cluster. While this was mitigated greatly by the fact that we had our own reserved area, anyone that comes here for non-semi-private events will have to expect to face these crowds, unless they stick with the upstairs bar, which was slightly less claustrophobic. So, if you're into the whole crowded club/party/college scene, Pappy's is a decent venue - my personal preference keeps me sticking to lounges that serve up artisan cocktails, however.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - A  large, spacious venue, with an elevator between the two floors, making accessibility into and throughout the venue easy, as long as it's not crowded. Once the people start flooding in though, all bets are out the window.

Bathroom - I didn't check them out, so I can't comment, but I was told they're completely ADA-compliant. However, on the bottom level (I'm not sure if they have any upstairs), the restrooms are on the side opposite of the elevator, meaning, at some point, you're going to have to wade through the insane mob of dancing bodies.
