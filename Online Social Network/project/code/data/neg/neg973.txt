Had high hopes for Spoon as it is really close to our apartment (and my work) - we went pretty late on a weeknight so we almost had the whole place to ourselves.

Our waiter was knowledgable and quick - it was a hot evening and we were sucking down our water which was in a small glasses but our waiter kept them refreshed for us.

I ended up ordering the Golden Tilapia and my husband ordered the Pad Thai. We were both very underwhelmed with the pad thai - I mean I know it's a generic thing to order at a thai restaurant, but this one was so bland! My fish, however, was very tasty but I could have used it spicier - I ended up adding more kick using red chili paste. I do think that $17 for tilapia is crazy expensive though.

We finished the meal off with their fried green tea ice cream which was AMAZING! The fried crust was just like a funnel cake and the ice cream was so fresh and creamy. The dessert was definitely the star of our trip here.

I think we will go back to try some other dishes for lunch sometime, so that it's cheaper.
