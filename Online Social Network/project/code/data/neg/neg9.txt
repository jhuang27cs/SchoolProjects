To get there I just have to roll down the hill in a blink of eye but I do not go there anymore and here's why:

2 Stars for parking lot - very limited (carpool if you can)
1 Star for street parking
1 Star for overall appearance
2 Stars for the very limited buffet selection
1 Star for failing to keep the buffet filled with food
4 Stars for the taste of the food being fairly authentic
3 Stars for the service 
2 Stars for the cleanliness especially the restrooms
2 Stars for value given the limited food selection & availability

They just cannot seem to keep an ample amount of food for me to get in and out with having to waste time waiting.  I seem to spend more time waiting than eating.  This could be on purpose so you do not go up too many times for the food.  If the kitchen could get their act together and keep the food in the buffet filled it could go to 3 stars.  The food trays are also tiny and  it only takes 3 or 4 people to empty it out.

It didn't take long for my work group to stop eating at SSR.
