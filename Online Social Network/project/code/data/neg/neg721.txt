This place was busy so I thought it was good or at least acceptable. 
I ordered a chicken sandwich and recieved one of my worst meals ever. 
It is hard to mess up a chicken sandwich but these guys did a great job on that, even McDonalds makes better chicken sandwiches than this. 
The chicken had been frozen, so it was rubbery, greasy and tasted like it was from a huge industrial farm. The bread was a soft, greasy hamburger bun full of sugar, and God knows what else. The green part was a slice of greasy soggy tomato and a greasy leaf of iceberg of course. Fries were soggy and greasy too.
Service was good though (except for the longish wait) and the servers were friendly.
