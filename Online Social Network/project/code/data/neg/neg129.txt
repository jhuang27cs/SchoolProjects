Very crowded (even when it's not...the tables are extremely close together so don't even try to bring a stroller or lots of shopping bags in here!) with brusque service and OK burgers. The burgers are innovative with so many combos to choose from, but the patty itself is nothing to write home about. Not sure what the hype is all about!
