Guh. I was wondering the other day, 'who the hell eats at TGI Fridays?', and I think the answer is, 'the same people who eat at BJs'. This place may sound good, with it's promise of house-brewed beer and pizzas, but the beer is tasteless, and the food is gross. I felt like crap after eating here, like a parade of midgets carrying sackfuls of salt had taken over my stomach. I was brined like a thanksgiving turkey, but from the inside.
