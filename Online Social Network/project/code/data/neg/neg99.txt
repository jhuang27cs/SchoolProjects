Not really a fan.  I'm always drawn in by the window display, but have never walked out with anything.  The prices tend to be more expensive, but cover the whole range.  When I have found something I would wear, it is generally over $250, and I don't like it enough to pay that price.  In general, most of the clothes in this store look like something to be worn by an ultra-trendy 40-something year old.
