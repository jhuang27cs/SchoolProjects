I came here to pick up a Sunday $10 grilled chicken bucket. Once I had payed, the cashier announced that they were out. When I asked her for an estimated time of when it would be ready, the kitchen staff communicated in Spanish with the cashier and told her it would be approximately 45 minutes for the grilled chicken to be ready. She then told me in English that it would be 15 minutes. I asked her for a refund and she returned my money.

I drove around the area and tried two KFC drive-thrus, they were completely sold out of grilled chicken. Are you fucking kidding me? I called 5 others that weren't even that close-by, all of them were out or could not communicate. I ended up coming back here and buying the bucket after 45 minutes had passed. Luckily for me, the staff was friendly and didn't seem to have a bad attitude. However, the cashier did lie to me. The chicken was bomb.
