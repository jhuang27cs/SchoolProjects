it's been a while since i ordered from matsuri or dined here but i remembered that it used to be decent. so when i was craving some chirashi after work, i decided to order from them since they are conveniently located on my way home.

for just under $20 i got some very low quality cuts of fish and i couldn't believe this but..... they forgot my wasabi! they were close by but not that close where i want to go through the trouble with packing the food up again, getting in my car and driving down there for a small dab of wasabi. but on the other hand - it makes a huge difference in taste and enjoying my meal. bah! i just ate it as is. 

this establishment is cute and the service is friendly but for the quality and key missing component of my meal - i doubt i'll be coming back.
