I have sort of mixed feelings about this place.  I feel like the meal could have been great, but when I went, it was pretty terrible.   I don't like Mexican food to begin with, but I usually can be decently happy with meals elsewhere at the other Mexican joints like El Toro or Dos Reales.

Pros:
- cheap
- open to 3AM
- large menu
- great chips and salsa

Cons:
- workers didn't understand english well at all.  Had really difficult time ordering
- Food came out wrong, for all of our entrees.  I had ordered a chicken entree.  I hate cheese on my dishes and the entree's description did not list cheese, yet it came out smothered in cheese.  To be honest, the cheese was what ruined my meal.  It was extremely salty and i hated the taste of it.  I also asked for no beans, but I got them too.  The other entrees had similar issues.
- Way to salty.  Mostly the cheese sauce they use.  Disgustingly salty. 
- really tiny inside, only 10 or so tables.  Huge line in store of people waiting to sit down.  We originally were going to eat in, but had to order to go.... but a table opened up while we were waiting after about 15 minutes.

All and all, I felt the meal could have been really good, but really this place gets the low rating because of the bad service.  Had our entrees come out right, this could have been a totally different review.  They didn't though, they came out very wrong, and I felt asking the workers to replace the error would have not gotten correctly communicated anyway due to their lack of English. 

I probably just hit it on a really bad day, but I won't be going again.
