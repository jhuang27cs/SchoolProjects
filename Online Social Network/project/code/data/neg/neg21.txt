DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL!

I booked a stay here, but found a hotel better located for my needs. I sent a cancellation notice to the hotel via email, and never heard back. So I sent another one and asked for confirmation - never got any. This was 4 and 3 days before my reservation date and within the time where I could cancel without cost.

I never went to this hotel, I stayed in the Sheraton instead, arriving at midnight after a delayed flight from Atlanta. They charged me for one night stay, saying that I checked in at 3:48pm - 5 hours before my plane was scheduled arrival at LAX, and 8 hours before my actual arrival in Pasadena. Then they went on to claim that I had checked out the next day at 6:25pm - what hotel lets you check out at 6:25pm without charging you for another day?

They are such liars! So the charge is in dispute, if they can produce a checkin sheet with my signature I will pay - but I know they don't have one because I have never been to this hotel.

UPDATE - They contacted me and asked me to remove this post as a condition of a refund. I refused, and they refunded anyway. The problem here was the fact that they sent an email confirmation and WAY WAY down on the very bottom was a note that said the email address was unmonitored (and it didn't bounce). So when I sent several cancellations, they dissapeared. No other email address is provided on the website, and although they talk about a cancellation procedure in the email confirmation, I couldn't find one anywhere. Most people use a "do not reply" address, but they do a lot of things different than other hotels.
