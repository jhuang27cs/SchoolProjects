Okay, let's get down to business.

SERVICE: Friendly, but sloooow.  We showed up around 1pm for lunch and they were unable to seat my group of 8 together, so they split us into fours (lame!!).  The other table ordered first, and when the waiter came over to my table, I wanted just another minute to decide... Don't you hate it when you say "Just a minute, please" and you literally mean a minute, but they come back 10 minutes later?  Well, that's what happened here.  After the delayed order, it took them much longer to bring out our food... and by the time we got our burgers, my friends at the other table were FINISHED EATING.  Grrr.

SELECTION: Pretty wide selection of burgers, both beef and chicken.  There are salads and soups and tacos for burger-haters =p  I appreciate the unlimited fries that come with burgers.

THE FOOOOODD:  My chili burger was pretty good; ate it with a fork and knife.  However, the french fries at our table were AWFUL!  They were so overfried that there was no delicious potato-y center... They were really just unpleasant.  We asked for a refill and the next batch was maaaarginally better (still overdone).

The bottom line: I haven't wanted to go to Islands in a while since I'm not really a burger fan in general, but oddly the burger was the only thing I enjoyed on this visit.  The slow service and the nasty fries really left a bad impression.
