I ran there once. I did not like it. There are no trees and you feel
like in a prison. To enter the trail you have to go through a heavy 
metallic door similar to the ones you found in prison ward. And there is indeed a security guard right at the entrance. You
cannot exist through any other gate as the whole
area is surrounded by fences AND you cannot run
a little bit out of the path itself. You are reminded by numerous signs that you should not step outside the path (penal code xxx). In a few words, it is nature at its worst. 

Parking is also very difficult on weekends. And do not park
on the streets of the professors, you will be ticketed.
And no toilet facilities or water. 

There are much better place to run or hike, 
like the San Antonio Rancho
park: water, nice trails, wild life, long or short trails, etc.

The only positive aspect of my run: I saw some radio telescopes a 
bit closer than usual, but again not too close as there are signs reminding everybody that it is a penal code to step outside the pave road. Give people a break.

Thank you Stanford to offer the space to ordinary people, but the invitation looks cheap given your financial means.
