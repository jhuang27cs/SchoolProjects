My previous review was:
"Good place for a first date" 4 stars
Well, that relationship went up in flames.

Just kidding. Kinda. I came here again and, I don't know what it is, the food doesn't taste good anymore. The chicken in the tikka masala was dry and impossible to chew and the alu ghobi was really salty.
To top it off, the meal made me really queasy and uncomfortable for the rest of the night (food poisoning? I dont know...)
