Country View Diner - Service was fast, food was hot.  Service wasn't friendly just fast.  Food was hot but eggs were overlooked setting on grill taste fair at best.  Cleanliness poor lots of entails not being maintained.  1 to 5 rating quality 2, service 3, cleanliness 2 & value 3.  Would not recommend.
