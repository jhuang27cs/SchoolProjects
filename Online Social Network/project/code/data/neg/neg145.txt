This was the favorite of my friends when we'd see a movie at the Bridge, er, Rave. I always balked going there because I want my Mexican food cooked with more love and care. The food had the elements of Mexican food, but it never seemed worth the calories. What I can say is that it's fast, which is important to make a movie showing. The food is also filling, but not in a soul satisfying way. 

I think Qdoba is successful because it fits a certain need - food for people who don't have the money or time to invest in a full restaurant experience. And it is a better alternative to the McDonalds that is a block away.
