1st and foremost vegetarians beware...Like other Yelpers we went with LivingSocial coupon for the Indulgence for two.  The 1st portion was superb - REAL fondue; CHEESE.  Then we were asked to select 4 entree items.  Only two are good for a vegetarian - the shrimp & scallops and then the chicken.  Interestingly the menu does state shrimp AND scallops however you only get one or the other.  We asked if we could order veges for our other two entrees...Get this - they want to charge you the same price for shrimp/beef or another entree for 8 (yes 8) mushrooms.  We had also ordered carrots but once the waitress told us the carrots count as one entree and the mushrooms count as another entree (#3 & #4) i said forget it.  I ordered the beef.  I gave my friend who is the vegetarian my two shrimp (so she got a total of 4) and she gave me her beef.  I find the whole experience of dipping your chicken, shrimp and mushrooms pretty gross when you also have beef.  I waited until my friend dipped/cooked all of her vegetarian portions before i put my beef in.  Honestly pretty disgusting to boil beef in vegetable broth if you think about it.  Very annoyed that they couldn't have offered us more shrimp or chicken for an entree vs. just vegetables.  Apparently the LS coupons don't allow for substitutions because what would've been better is to order another cheese fondue which is basically the same price as each of the entrees.  

I also find it interesting that Nicole G (yelper) was able to get the Trio for dessert as we were told specifically by our waitress that item and the make your own dessert (???) were excluded from the LS deal...Seems different rules apply when using these types of coupons.  We feel we learned a good lesson; but thankfully it wasn't an expensive lesson (i.e. we only paid $55 vs. $110 for this deal).

I would NEVER go back or recommend this place.
