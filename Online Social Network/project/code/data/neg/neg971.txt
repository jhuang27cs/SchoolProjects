The shop is cute.  If you're a lover of paper products, you'll enjoy browsing.  However, it is quite simply overpriced.  Moreover, I feel as if I'm in a china shop.  I am a tactile person and I want to touch items, but in here I feel stuffy and uncomfortable.  

I most agree with Angela who had lived in Austin... the selection isn't that expansive or unique.  I just moved from Nashville and that may be swaying my opinion as well.  I'm still in search of a paper product store that just feels fun and airy and inviting.  This wasn't it...

Lastly, they day I was in the store the staff member totally ignored me while she talked on her cell the whole time.  She was talking about what a bad mood she was in which made me want to get out there fast!
