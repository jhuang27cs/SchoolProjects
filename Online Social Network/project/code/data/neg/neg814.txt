I somehow managed to sign up for something with Taco Cabana that awarded me a free meal on my birthday...  so I printed the coupon and headed that way.
Taco Cabana is hardly a top notch space for Mexican, and I don't expect much from them ever.
We walk in.  Wait
wait
wait
at the register... while people who work there are looking at us.  Somehow, I suppose they realize that we aren't a figment of their imaginations and someone walks over to take our order.
We sit and wait
and wait 
and wait.
I go to check to see what is taking so long and see that the staff is still just standing around.  Nobody has prepared anything.  
They see me and snap out of the haze and walk around like a herd of keystone cops trying to assemble a flauta plate.
The flautas looked as if they'd been sitting for quite some time, the rice was gross, mushy and burned in spots, the beans were spoiled and sour.
We ate the flour tortillas with the queso, guac and sour cream, then threw the plate away and left. 
It was free...
