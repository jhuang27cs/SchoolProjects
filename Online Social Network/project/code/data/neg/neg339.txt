Pushy pushy sales women! I haven't had a problem with the boutique before, but I was told repeatedly, "just get it," "it's a no brainier" and "oh its on sale? Oh then that's a yes" in front of several other people. They made me feel embarrassed not to have bought anything! Horrible! Tisk. Tisk. I won't be going back. It was that pushy. It's sad because I really enjoy their store, but I just don't want to run into that women again...
