Mehhh.

This place symbolizes much of what can be so frustrating about San Luis Obispo. The fact that it's so overwhelmingly successful on Yelp is disturbing and honestly makes me doubt taking suggestions from this site entirely.

It's great if:

- You don't mind a turn and burn business ethic or fighting for a dirty table
- You enjoy watching multiple simultaneous sports with a horde of other rabid fans
- You are visiting from Fresno, Bakersfield, or a similar place
- You enjoy an atmosphere where the majority of people's eyes are glued to huge screens rather than the people they came with or the food they are eating
- You don't mind covering poor quality food with a ton of MSG laden seasoning, ranch dressing, and BBQ sauce that tastes like molasses
- You like Hooter's
- You like being a member of large, high intensity crowds
- When you see a long line you think "this place must be good"
- You were/are a jock, business or agriculture major, or are a member/want to be a member of the clique of prominent local good ol' boys
- You are a nice person and don't mind appeasing friends who want to go there :)

That being said, there is definitely worse out there, which is why it gets 2 stars. I understand that it's a sports bar and the screens and people and everything are to be expected, and I love burgers and beers as much as the next guy. I just think there are much better places to do it.
