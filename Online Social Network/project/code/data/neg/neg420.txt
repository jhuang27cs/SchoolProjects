The food is typical mediocre diner food. How can you really screw up eggs, toast, fries and coffee? It's fine, but good is a stretch.

The service is quite bad.  First, the "hostess" denied us the two top we asked for, because they needed to combine that with another (occupied) table for a five person party. Before our order was even taken that table went to two others. I also had to repeatedly ask for my coffee and then refills (kind of a diner staple). Lastly I waited and waited to get my check paid.

They made a few errors in their  redesign from the Westway. Sure it is lighter and more modern, but it's a diner. The tables are small, but plates are HUGE, so they don't fit on the table. Also making for a less than pleasant dining experience.

I see no reason to go back. There are other options in the neighborhood.
