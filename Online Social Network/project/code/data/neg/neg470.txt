Correction: I go here only when Appethai is closed, and only because Thai 65 is even worse.

If you choose to keep a restaurant open on New Year's Day, expect it to be hectic. That's no excuse for the terrible service. First, we're seated at a table so wobbly our drinks would have fallen off. Then, we're not told that several dishes are unavailable until we order them. Better yet, our check arrives less than five minutes after our entrees -- sure makes the customer feel welcome and not hurried at all. After we're finally done eating, the waitress ignores our table before finally taking our payment and bringing a box -- only for me. I seldom advocate leaving a bad tip, but that instance as worth it (and in that instance, I include the indigestion that lingered all night).
