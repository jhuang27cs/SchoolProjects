Preface: I *DISLIKE* (TRYING TO BE NICE, REAL HARD) people who review shit who've never eaten there. 

Ok, Now on to the review. This place is close to my life in office hell. Damn, if only proximity were relevant to the food need i have. 
The taco's are kinda sucky. They were made at 4 AM or something and taste pretty sad. Where I come from "Picadillo" does not mean ground beef. It's usually beef, with other stuff, like tomato, sometimes potato, carrot, etc. But here its just ground beef. BORING. 

The egg taco's taste like you bit into a warmed up airline egg- chewy and overcooked. the taco truck that used to pull into the Reagan Building loading dock used to be MUCH better.

Lunchtime I tried the standard enchiladas. I've had frozen dinners that were better, or have I? Standard greasy faire with that brown sauce that floats the grease on top, spilling over to a red grease Exxon Valdez on the Styrofoam takeout box. 

Nuevo Leon Taco Express, as lame as the original, but smaller!
