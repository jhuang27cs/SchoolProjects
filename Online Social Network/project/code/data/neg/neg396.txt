I bought a Toyota Land Cruiser from Northway Toyota and am not happy with their customer service.  I bought it sight unseen and asked it to be shipped to AZ.   They took photos and sent them to me and the vehicle arrived with no more scratches or blemishes than I was expecting but they didn't deliver what was promised.  I was promised and sold on the fact that the 2 remote headphones for the entertainment system would be included, that their was a tow package on the SUV, and that the Land Cruiser had satellite radio.  Upon receipt of the Land Cruiser those three items weren't there.  They had a receptacle for the tow package but no electrical hook up.  I have had to contract with another vendor to have that added.  When I called about the XM Radio they told me I would have to buy the "add on kit" if I wanted XM in the vehicle.  They did send me two headphones, but I am not impressed as that was just one small part of the promises that they had made me.  IF, and I cannot stress enough the word IF, you decide to give them a shot, before you leave the lot or sign on the line, make sure you are getting everything that was promised or they will screw you out of it later.  I do not recommend Northway Toyota of Latham, NY in any way whatsoever.
