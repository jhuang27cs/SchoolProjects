This place does have a great concept with the dualing pianos, the check-in deal, the Shots spin wheel... stuff like that. But I would SOOOO much rather drive a little further, spend the money for parking and just go to Howl At The Moon at City Walk. 

So I've been to this place on three different occasions. The first time... I could not have left faster. SOO dull and boring! The second time was for my sisters bday. The only reason I had fun this time was bc I ended up getting drunk. The third time was the same as the first time, DULL. Most people just sit in their seats. The crowd looks like middle aged people trying to prove that they can have fun, and the older men are creepy and just check out the younger girls. I felt this place was a typical IE hangout.
