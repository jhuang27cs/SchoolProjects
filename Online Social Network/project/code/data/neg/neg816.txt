Every time I see this food stand I am reminded of hip hop's Roxanne wars.

Le Ahn vs. The Real Le Ahn?

As far as Chinese food on wheels goes this one's not so great. 

When I asked if they had brown rice, the reply was "I can put soy sauce on it, that'll make it brown." Clever, but, no, thanks.

Anyway, I prefer Roxanne Shant√© to The Real Roxanne. So, you may be able to gather my feelings for The Real Le Ahn.
