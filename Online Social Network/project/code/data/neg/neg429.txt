This is really not a 5 star place. Not unless you're drunk and/or you want beer and the distributor is closed.

I've tried several different slices of pizza here. The sauce on the BBQ chicken was pretty sweet, almost overly so. And the chicken was dry, dry dry. Their tomato pie has been pretty bland every time I've gotten it. Not a lot of garlic or spices and the tomatoes aren't very fresh. The only redeeming slice I've had there so far has been the Buffalo chicken. The buffalo wing sauce on the pizza has a nice zip to it. That's about the only thing I"ll order if I go there.

Servicewise, yes the people there are very nice. They process your order, take your money and bam, your done. Kudos for efficiency.

As far as atmosphere, its on a college campus, so it gets loud when everyone is there. It doesn't help that they BLARE the TV sound night and day. Also, NEVER, never, never EVER go there during Spring Fling weekend. 

It's cheap and filling. Don't expect much more and you won't be disappointed.
