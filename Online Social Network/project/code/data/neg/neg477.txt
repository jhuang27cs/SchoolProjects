As someone who grew up on bagels, esp. from New York, I always have a soft spot for them. The search for a decent bagel here in Houston is in full force. I've had Einstein bagels before but never had the experience of walking into the shop. One day I was in the mood for an everything bagel and while driving down Kirby, decided to drop by and pick one up. First off the parking lot is small and was full when I got there which is never a great way to start off my experience, but to be fair it was a Saturday morning.

Anytime I walk into a new restaurant or store I kind of scope it out first. Where do I order, where do I pay, is there seating, or how graphically designed is the menu. Is it easy to read and helpful or does it make me want to poke my eyes out and run.

So I go up to the order area and here is where the rating starts to drop. I gave my order to the gentleman and really got a cold stare/response. Very unwelcoming. Look I realize you probably don't like the job you have, I get that...trust me, but at the same time you should be thankful to have one. It wasn't just this person but also at the other counter where I paid. In a place that seemed to have 10 people working right behind the counter I only wonder if maybe they could switch positions to have someone a little more friendly. I don't need or want someone to act like my new best friend but to show some emotion or acknowledgement would be nice. I've worked in customer service and half assing it works if you want it too...I didn't even get that.

But enough about them how are the bagels? Not bad. I don't drool over them like I would back home but in a pinch they do the job. The secret to my continual consumption of these bagels is to have someone else go buy them for me.
