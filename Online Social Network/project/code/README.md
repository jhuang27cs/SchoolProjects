PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU RUN THE PROJECT

Because we use the data from yelp. The data file 'yelp_academic_dataset.json' is too big to upload to the github.

But in the project we already collect the data from the json file and save them into the test and train folders. 

Please don't run the collect data method from the 'yelp_academic_dataset.json'. Because we will not upload the json file.

And if you need the json file, we can copy to you with hard drive or share you a google drive link.

Sorry for the incovenient.
